dark helmet works and start pulling some

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,929
information back from the attacker and

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,579
using that to identify him so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

and Ollie and reverse all the things in

43
00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:00,610
reality that's what I did submitted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

44
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:04,390
virustotal that borrows toward the wall

45
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:07,660
might work for me so before I get into

46
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:09,869
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cover disclaimers like said these</font>

47
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,150
are all my own<font color="#E5E5E5"> views none of my employer</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">alone a lawyer which leads me on to the</font>

49
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,540
next one some of the tools and

50
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:20,590
techniques that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about</font>

51
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,940
may not be legal for you to use so i'll

52
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,150
be releasing the tool pack at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of</font>

53
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,530
the day if you don't want to use them

54
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,019
then obviously make sure you get the

55
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,579
right legal coverage to go and do so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

56
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:33,250
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for how you choose to</font>

57
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:34,269
use the tools and techniques that<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

58
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,709
said i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you how to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

59
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:41,049
them to the case at the end obviously

60
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:43,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">because this is such a bike all of the</font>

61
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:46,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">gray area others will will argue with me</font>

62
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,530
all the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to show you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today</font>

63
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:49,660
isn't live<font color="#E5E5E5"> i haven't done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a live</font>

64
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,860
engagement because that would involve me

65
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,720
actually breaking somebody else's

66
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,060
computer so all the data is love

67
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,700
generated but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do have some real</font>

68
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,650
samples of the kind of data just to

69
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:04,298
prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> my point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the data i'm showing</font>

70
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:06,280
you is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data you can get so</font>

71
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:11,709
we're going to talk about quick intro

72
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:13,420
comet is who uses it look at defensive

73
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:15,519
posture first so the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attribution</font>

74
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,309
you can do from a defensive point of

75
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,100
view actually we'll discuss the usual

76
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,380
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know get into the more funds to</font>

77
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,510
full look is the offensive side look at

78
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,849
discovery

79
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,939
how you can identify the attackers those

80
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:31,048
guys who are using<font color="#CCCCCC"> that comment and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

81
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:33,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to show you how to loosen</font>

82
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:35,280
traffic load testing they like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> call</font>

83
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:36,450
this traffic load testing rather than

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,730
boss but that's what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we're going</font>

85
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,578
to show you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can boss a dark</font>

86
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,530
comic attacker and the remote file read

87
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:44,629
which is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting bit right at</font>

88
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,129
the end and then like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said the</font>

89
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:53,790
occasionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you how to tie all</font>

90
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:56,548
this together so that comet<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's remote</font>

91
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,230
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trojan it's been around publicly</font>

92
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:02,040
available and free since about two

93
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:05,010
thousand eight a cola called dark comet

94
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,239
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> dart code or SC just put it</font>

95
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,280
together just because he could he wanted

96
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,920
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play with it he released it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for free</font>

97
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,120
the hacking community picked it up the

98
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,578
script kiddie community especially

99
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,579
picked this up quite heavily and it is

100
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:19,889
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most favorite remote access</font>

101

<font color="#E5E5E5">Trojans in these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forums</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

102
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:23,520
feature-rich so everything the<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect</font>

you that it's one of the first to give

105
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:32,940
you a wide variety of stuff from file

106
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:35,820
transfers you can cup to webcam audio

107
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,039
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> install more tools capture all</font>

108
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:42,659
key logs or keystrokes and there's a lot

109
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:45,560
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will do as well it came to</font>

110
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,030
light in the Syrian conflict in 2012

111
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,560
there's a couple reports came out<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

112
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">see them a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little later that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this was</font>

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,660
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> used so what he decided to do he</font>

114
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,280
was happy to release a tool that script

115
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,479
kiddies could use to perv on girls

116
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,400
webcams but when the Syrian government

117
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,169
kicked in he<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a little bit upset so</font>

118
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,239
he<font color="#CCCCCC"> cancelled it he pulled all the</font>

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:06,270
downloads off his website and stopped

120
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,870
developing it which also means is no

121
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer updated so the vulnerability the</font>

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,250
exploit that was discovered<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's never</font>

123
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:15,990
going to be patched you can still

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,550
download<font color="#CCCCCC"> virgin's about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comet they're</font>

125
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,729
all susceptible to the attack which will

126
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:25,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">a will show later on good for us part of</font>

127
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:26,699
the bad guys so who uses it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

128
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,030
said script kiddies they use it a lot

129
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:32,510
and they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for this kind of thing</font>

130
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:36,929
government web<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes trolling people</font>

131
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:37,770
stealing facebook profiles photos it's

132
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,690
that kind of

133
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,240
so it's what you'd expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's little</font>

134
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:45,919
kids playing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> us in the in the monks</font>

victims slaves is actively controlling

139
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:59,629
I've seen that comic controllers with

140
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:03,059
hundreds of thousands of collections of

141
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:07,349
effective people controlling them eek

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:10,080
i'm still this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a news report from</font>

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,318
by in crime the flavor of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the month is</font>

145
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,849
is things like ransomware dried<font color="#CCCCCC"> x</font>

146
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,889
banking trojans but that's not what

147
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:22,440
everybody uses we're still seeing a

148
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:25,169
small portion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the e-tron community</font>

149
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,639
using tools like this it's mike golic

150
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:28,289
it's harder for them to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they can</font>

151
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,250
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more control</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and more flexibility</font>

152
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:34,349
than just dropping dried eggs on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

153
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:38,430
and again<font color="#CCCCCC"> early this year it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

154
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:40,440
very active so our script kiddies the

155
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,150
kids in mom's basement we seek i'm using

156
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,340
it and as we saw before you see

157
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,560
government using this state-sponsored<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

hate to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the term apt to describe</font>

159
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:58,770
this so we go the Syrian<font color="#E5E5E5"> abuse sort of a</font>

160
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:00,449
defensive point of view I<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

161
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,919
the usual<font color="#E5E5E5"> things but the network point</font>

162
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:04,020
of view you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a host important</font>

163
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,609
which got a host<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a port you can</font>

can start<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting that kind of</font>

166
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,580
information you can start putting IDs

rules firewall rules the normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

168
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,250
things I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to dwell on these</font>

169
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:19,380
too much<font color="#CCCCCC"> ioc's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vials install paths</font>

171
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,099
more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your host based system so you</font>

172
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,099
can use these to defensively look for

173
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:28,409
this stuff or in the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of new Texas</font>

174
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:31,800
there's a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good paper going around</font>

175
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:33,509
that uses iocs to prevent infection a

196
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,180
install the same so this gives you a

00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,800
really nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of attribution data</font>

information for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so ports passwords</font>

208
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,420
campaign IDs all this kind of

211
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,980
like submitting that data to a public

212
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,320
forum then I've also released a handful

213
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:02,920
of started decoders as well the links

214
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:05,920
are on<font color="#CCCCCC"> there right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's it I</font>

215
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,540
skipped over that pretty quickly like I

216
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,560
said it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the normal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff it's a</font>

00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:15,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">day-to-day stuff this is the more fun</font>

218
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,140
stuff so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like a discovery</font>

219
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,219
first it's like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said if you've got the</font>

220
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:24,880
binary file that it's easy post ports

221
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:29,560
passwords and ftp credentials so dark

222
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,150
comet has the ability to ftp hg logs so

223
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,650
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's recording all your keystrokes</font>

224
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's writing them out to a disk if</font>

you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected to the internet</font>

226
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,710
then what it busy sports<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto disk and</font>

227
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:43,030
as soon as the detective on live again

228
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:45,220
it will ftp them up in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ftp you</font>

229
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:48,040
have to give it an ftp<font color="#E5E5E5"> username and a</font>

230
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:51,910
password what we see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> izzy's</font>

231
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,099
guys they won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> create bespoke ftp</font>

232
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,719
services they won't create user accounts

233
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,250
with privileged access for themselves

234
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,550
and then a nonprofit account that can

235
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,800
just

236
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:02,589
load it they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just use the same brute ftp</font>

237
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,990
account over and over again like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

238
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:07,390
a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things i simply open</font>

239
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,950
filezilla ftp onto their machine and I

240
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,319
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start pulling any additional files</font>

00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:14,890
at whatever any other malware anything

242
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,589
they've saved I can get that swinging

243
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:20,350
back to an attribution point of view i

244
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:22,029
conceal their logs so if I've got the

245
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,519
username the password<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're using</font>

connecting myself pull their log file

Paul 1604 then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need some way to find</font>

00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:03,540
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> one likes it a little bit earlier</font>

banners so<font color="#E5E5E5"> dark comet has its own banner</font>

285
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:09,969
all you have to do we send a three-way

handshake to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> port and what you get</font>

00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:17,508
banner<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the word idtype encrypted with</font>

291
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,800
once you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's encrypted with</font>

292
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:26,240
what the string is and what the

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,709
passwords are going to be we can

294
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,040
pre-compute on these and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then go</font>

295
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:32,089
searching which is exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I did so</font>

00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:44,529
search head of the banner<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found 10 of</font>

299
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:48,259
them skipping through the versions so

00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:50,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">5.12 5.3 is the latest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> version the final</font>

00:12:50,779 --> 00:13:00,139
password I found 863 attackers now this

303
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:02,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the bad guy on his machine who is</font>

running dark comet and waiting for

victims to connect into him 863 them

306
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,019
just by searching<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and this</font>

307
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:11,920
isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> going over every port again this</font>

308
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:14,629
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the default passwords</font>

under the<font color="#CCCCCC"> handful of default ports that</font>

310
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:18,649
show done actually searches so if you

311
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,969
can imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> how this is going to</font>

312
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:22,069
extrapolate when you look at the guys

313
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,299
were using their own passwords which we

314
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:25,248
can't do upon a search while the guys

315
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:28,970
who are using non-standard ports that

316
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:30,199
number could jump up the kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

317
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,749
information we can get from shown on

318
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:34,309
them so we get the version number the

319
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:36,110
banner that's what we generated on

320

I said there's a lot of information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

targeting somebody who's targeting you

domains or appease you can go scan them

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,540
yourself quick em up<font color="#E5E5E5"> scripts with these</font>

334
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,460
banners and you'll very quickly tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

335
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,500
if they've got anything running there or

336
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,510
if you're really fun so you could just

337
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:24,340
mask on the entire internet every port

338
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:26,110
for all these banners so<font color="#E5E5E5"> signs get into</font>

339
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:30,180
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the all over the hope is more</font>

340
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,180
interesting stuff traffic load testing

341
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:35,650
so we've got the host the poor and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

342
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,540
password we've got this either from the

343
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,310
binary file or we've got it from show

344
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,079
done well if we did a search the banner

345
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,430
then we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the password is</font>

346
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,820
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how we generated the</font>

347
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:49,290
runner this is all we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need for the</font>

348
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:52,090
victim to connect to the dark comic line

349
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:54,849
it's a reverse connection like motor out

350
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:56,920
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that they caught the dark</font>

351
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,600
rum attacker doesn't connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

352
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,709
victim it's the victim<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sends its</font>

353
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:04,960
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the controller and the</font>

354
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:08,050
controller trust see there's no string

355
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,700
validation there's no checks so if i

356
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,990
tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm on a certain IP address it</font>

357
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,420
doesn't start checking to make sure

358
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:17,830
those too much whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> they try send it</font>

359
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:20,610
it inherently trusts and hopefully the

360
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,610
demo gods are kind

361
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,400
I'm a second

362
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:55,388
Oh

363
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:03,219
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my bad guy so he's got that</font>

364
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:06,160
comet running he's got a handful of bad

365
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:10,050
guys connected and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come and</font>

366
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">upset his day so like I said all we need</font>

367
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,430
and I forgot<font color="#E5E5E5"> how difficult it was to try</font>

368
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:20,430
and read from there

369
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,420
so what we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got there is the Python</font>

370
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:50,420
script is going to run this collection

371
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:52,519
we've got his IP address his port number

372
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,319
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> password the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> password that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

373
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,639
see there is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> default password</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

374
00:16:54,319 --> 00:17:00,469
it's the one that every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single instance</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of dark comic version 5.1</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to 5.3 uses so</font>

376
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,980
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even need to extract that from</font>

the binary you go to show down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

380
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:41,050

here interested so we can see now and I

382
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:46,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">appreciate it might be a bit difficult</font>

383
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:47,680
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys to see but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the script</font>

384
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:51,220
is doing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's randomly generating an</font>

him to filter them all at the same time

402
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:29,830
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all being stored in a secure</font>

403

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:34,090
parameters to start including large

405
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,380
sections of junk code i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

filling<font color="#E5E5E5"> up his hard drive and very</font>

quickly his machines gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to</font>

408
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,670
become slow and sluggish and basically

409
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,670
make it unusable

410
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:54,999
from my one machine if I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a couple</font>

00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:02,769
blocking him from using is that comet

414
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,279
again it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be ethical but I snow</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this is all about</font>

416
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,399
so the remote far read so this is

417
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,780
hopefully the fun stuff again this it

418
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,370
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a little more interesting than</font>

424
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:55,070
they did is they looked at the common

425
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,990
right to the time the rights are being

428
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,689
reverse-engineer them looking at the the

429
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:06,830
protocols they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> using for network</font>

430
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:09,320
activity and what they discovered is

431
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,879
that you can request any file from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

432
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,250
dark comic controller so that's from the

433
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,110
attacker you could quest any file and

434
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,750
have that returned<font color="#E5E5E5"> by to you there are a</font>

00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the context of the current user so</font>

437
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,679
whatever files he's got access to

438
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:27,169
whatever he can read then you can read

439
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:30,860
them as well and you have to know the

440
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:34,340
full path or a relative path from the

441
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:39,250
folder that's when in doubt comet which

442
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I shall hopefully showing up</font>

you

444
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,320
I so appointed again if it's difficult

445
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:58,928
to read so again another Python script

446
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,360
we give the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of information we</font>

447
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:02,740
give you the host the<font color="#E5E5E5"> port we give it</font>

448
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,418
the password we wanted to connect to and

449
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,850
then we give it the file we wanted to

450
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:07,870
retrieve now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this instance what I'm</font>

451
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:10,928
going to do is I'm gonna pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> down the</font>

452
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:14,350
comic database file the comet did<font color="#E5E5E5"> DB</font>

453
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:16,450
file stored in the same box as the story

454
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:19,418
in the same directory as the dot-com is

455
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:22,629
run from so no relative paths just give

456
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:25,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">it the name this database file contains</font>

457
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:28,120
the IP address of every victim who's

458
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,830
ever connected to the box it contains

459

460
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:35,830
stolen from each of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> victims so</font>

461
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,539
we've identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attacker we can</font>

462
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:40,389
connect his machine we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell exactly</font>

463
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:43,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">who we infected when he infected them</font>

464
00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:43,860
and what information he stole<font color="#CCCCCC"> from them</font>

465
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:51,309
and that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's all it took we</font>

466
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:52,960
connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> we create a session we</font>

467
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:55,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">connected in and we pull that file down</font>

468
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,899
now if you saw there is a visible

469
00:22:55,539 --> 00:23:00,549
indication to the attacker when you're

470
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:02,439
pulling<font color="#E5E5E5"> a file down he will get a little</font>

471
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:06,580
prompt saying that a file is being

472
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,929
transferred now the file when it says

473
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,939
it's been transferred it will list the

474
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:12,129
IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> is being transferred to but</font>

475
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">that IP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address is the fake IP address</font>

476
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:17,559
that we use to generate the connection

477
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,669
which is randomly generated by Python so

478
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:21,100
you're not actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving any</font>

479
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:23,049
information away visibly to the attacker

480
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,980
obviously if he goes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Texas logs then</font>

481
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:30,490
you're going to reveal your IP address

482
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:32,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">that way so that was the dark comet</font>

483
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:37,269
database file and if we have a quick

484
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:40,199
look inside that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you the kind</font>

485

of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get</font>

486
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:58,150
so

487
00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:00,190
I should write the start that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm all</font>

said the comic database file is

498
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:23,139
can get it is if somebody shares it with

502
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,850
sorts of media sharing they share it out

503
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:33,130
not realizing they're also sharing up

504
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,899
the comic database file you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> proper look at one of these search</font>

509
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:54,790
I can appreciate that's not very clear

510
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:57,160
on there but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this contains is users</font>

some of the key log data later but<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

at the same time all these connections

536
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,460
they're having all their key log data

readable but all you have to do is hex

00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:32,970
decode that how to make things easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

543
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:34,650
save you having to trawl through these

544
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,720
yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wrote another script that</font>

545
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:39,180
will query the database extract all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,810
information and make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice for even if</font>

I just from that

548
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:06,230
so there's some scripting again I'll be

549
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,850
relational towards afterwards really

550
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:10,370
does a couple of things when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will</font>

551
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:13,389
just process with a database I'll tell

00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:16,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">you that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it found 495 infected hosts</font>

553
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:18,680
will export all those into a CSV file

554
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:21,140
and do it to you look up so you get the

555

country code the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">on again apologies for the clarity on</font>

00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:56,299
explorer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll tell you gmail the good</font>

566
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:59,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing about gmail it gives you your</font>

567
00:27:56,299 --> 00:28:01,279
email<font color="#E5E5E5"> address in the title of the bar so</font>

568
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:03,080
as the bad guys flicking through this he

569
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,840
sees allowing this as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet Explorer</font>

570
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:10,250
he seizes on gmail com and he has the

571
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the guys gmail email just right</font>

572
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,090
there visible to him then it records

573
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,549
every keystroke including back spaces

574
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:19,789
and any special characters so as he's

575
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:22,460
typing in his password it's now recorded

576
00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:24,080
in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this is sent live back to</font>

577
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,480
the controller at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're typing</font>

578
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,039
the keystrokes it's also saved on disk

579
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,169
so if you do happen to lose internet

580
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,629
connectivity to the victim then or just

581
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:36,139
ftp up to your ftp server and you can

582
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:38,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't go and grab that later again</font>

583
00:28:36,139 --> 00:28:39,889
if you grab<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself one of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> random</font>

584
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:41,000
dark comic files from any on the

585
00:28:39,889 --> 00:28:43,549
internet and saturn look through these

586
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,659
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of information so i told</font>

logged<font color="#E5E5E5"> into chase he logged in with his</font>

593
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:04,909
transferred money between two accounts

594
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,340
so what account numbers I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> balance</font>

595
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:11,539

609
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:48,020
it back to being a good guy I now know

610
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:50,289
exactly what information was leaked so

611
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,770
if I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacked my corporate</font>

615
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:00,080
I want to know what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost they say</font>

616
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:02,750
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I connect back into the attacker</font>

617
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,149
using the details using the tools I pull

00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:07,040
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> comic database file out I can now</font>

619
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:09,320
say with one hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent certainty</font>

620
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,750
that those internal IP addresses of mine

621
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:15,889
were compromised visit the data that

622
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:18,020
left my state so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start looking at</font>

623
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:20,030
remediation I've got the internal one I

624
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:22,190
period the internal lan IP h<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is my</font>

625
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:24,830
one address I now know which machines

626
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:26,030
instantly need remediation I can

627
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:27,409
instantly block them on the firewall

628
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:29,450
ports I can instantly go to these

629
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:30,740
machines unplug them read format them

630
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,570
and clean them and I know that with the

631
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,720
effective machine because I see it in

632
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:37,490
the in the box I can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through these</font>

633
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,200
key logs I can look for the chase bank

634
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:42,470
accounts the amazon accounts the

635
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,200
corporate accounts the proxy logons of

636
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:47,450
VPN access all that information that was

637
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,160
recorded<font color="#E5E5E5"> just flick through here I can</font>

638
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:51,200
tell instantly that those accounts are

639
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,540
definitely compromised reset<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

640
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,300
passwords is getting me a step closer to

641
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:57,649
secure in my environment like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said you</font>

642
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,510
may be breaking a law<font color="#CCCCCC"> gain another</font>

643
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:02,800
information but that's a few legal team

644
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,800
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a to the side</font>

645
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,139
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows and for the most</font>

646
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,789
part that's where the bad guy runs if

647
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:24,400
it's a windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> too little windows exe</font>

648
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:28,000
designed to run on windows it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

649
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:30,309
in a linux and to prove my point there's

650
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,380
a forum post of people posting guides

651
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:33,908
and comments and nothing how do i

652
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,679
reminisce on linux and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said this</font>

653
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:37,179
is how you do it so we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

654
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,679
are running<font color="#E5E5E5"> the saloon Ock's and as</font>

655
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:41,080
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see in a moment this</font>

656
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:44,220
gives us something even more interesting

657
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,220
than what we just saw

658
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:58,908
over my second we'll just switch the

659
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:58,909
elms otherwise want to kill a machine

660
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:58,209
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my bad guy he's followed one</font>

661
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:00,610
of those guys he's got himself a copy of

662
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:03,190
Carly he's installed wine and he's

663
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:05,649
opened our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Comment with one it still</font>

664
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,970
works everything's exactly the same so

665
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,179
whether it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to apply those same</font>

666
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:11,049
techniques as we did to Windows machine

667
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:16,620
except willing to apply it against this

668
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:16,620
machine so

669
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,050
so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I first said there are a couple</font>

670
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:07,300
of caveats this one is you have to know

671
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:09,100
the file path the full file path or

672
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,529
relative file path and you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in</font>

673
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,899
the context of the current user<font color="#CCCCCC"> now if</font>

674
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:17,710
you're running on Carly linux your

675
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:19,389
default user is root linux<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really</font>

676
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:21,699
good at naming stuff and putting stuff

677
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:23,830
in very fixed locations like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> agey</font>

678
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:26,259
password etsy shadow so you're running

679
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:31,290
as root I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where those files</font>

680
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:40,600
are which<font color="#CCCCCC"> means that I can go get them</font>

681
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:43,389
so all I've done there is I've pulled

682
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,918
your password<font color="#CCCCCC"> follow obviously for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

683
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:46,270
of you familiar with linux to password

684
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:47,980
files not actually stored in there the

685
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:50,168
passwords hashed and salted into shadow

686
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:52,649
master the problem thats it again is in

687
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:52,649
a fixed location

688
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:10,759
I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to go get the shadow file and</font>

689
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:15,130
it'll do that as well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shoe when I</font>

690
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,130
actually typed that correctly

691
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,169
there goes so I've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulled the</font>

692
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:39,279
shadow file so I'm now get your password

693
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:42,220
file I've got your shadow file so i can

694
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,920
now start throwing those passwords into

695
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:48,220
john the ripper and I've now got full

696
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">SSH access</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to your box so with your user</font>

697
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,910
name with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> password knowing your</font>

698
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:54,010
room knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're on Carly knowing</font>

699
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,990
your IP address knowing you're likely

700
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:57,099
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be running SSH on port 22 I</font>

701
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:59,439
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to bother with that come</font>

702
00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:01,270
anymore I can just come straight in ssh

703
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,560
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy box and take whatever file are</font>

704
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:08,650
like and it gets a little bit scary than

705
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:12,840
that so linux person to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the windows</font>

706
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:18,790
doesn't and it makes it very easy to

707
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:24,570
access the<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk and access rum so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

708
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:24,570
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> come back to my box</font>

709
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:36,890
so again for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those of you familiar with</font>

710
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:40,220
linux your hard drives have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a file</font>

711
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:43,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">handle and all drives have a handle so /</font>

712
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:47,750
dev / SDA is typically your primary hard

713
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:51,460
drive sdb goes for USB drives and

714
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:54,520
removable drives and things like that so

715
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:57,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">your route I know that their vests da</font>

716
00:36:54,520 --> 00:37:06,050
contains the full path to your hard

717
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:08,420
drive so<font color="#CCCCCC"> while I drop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so what that's</font>

718
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:13,660
doing now is that's connecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the</font>

719
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:13,660
bad guys machine and timing out

720
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:47,220
yoga helps when you're typing the right

721
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,990
file path so that's doing now is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

722
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,240
starting at the very start your drive

723
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:53,660
I'm writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> your entire hard drive</font>

724
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,790
across the wire back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> machine I</font>

725
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:59,129
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> that finish I've now got a full</font>

726
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:01,740
friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> who gave me to go box so every</font>

727
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:03,540
file I want I've got it there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

728
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">access any of that data using any of the</font>

729
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:08,670
forensics tools available to me so that

730
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:10,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be great for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> physical files</font>

731
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:12,240
on the box<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you're doing stuff in</font>

732
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,650
in passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're storing</font>

733
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,359
usernames or passwords and stuff

734
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:17,549
somewhere then memories what I want

735
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:23,119
luckily Linux also gives us access to

736
00:38:17,549 --> 00:38:23,119
that as well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font>

737
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:32,710
so / staff /<font color="#CCCCCC"> mem that's the handle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

738
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,380
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory so I'm now dumping your</font>

739
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:37,089
entire memory across the wire back onto

740
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,010
my machine I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> now forensically</font>

741
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:40,450
analyzed this<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time I like for this</font>

742
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:42,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">interval utility with a couple of</font>

743
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:44,828
plugins and start extracting ssh-keys

744
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:46,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">usernames</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords pretty much any</font>

745
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:49,000
piece of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want so what</font>

746
00:38:46,779 --> 00:38:50,950
you've done by using dark comet also not

747
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,039
you the attacker is done by<font color="#CCCCCC"> using dark</font>

748
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:56,859
comic on Carly and then attacking people

749
00:38:54,039 --> 00:39:01,289
he just turned his hacking tool into my

750
00:38:56,859 --> 00:39:01,288
forensics tool that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

751
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:35,430
so the last demo I'm going to do I'm

752
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:38,430
going to switch back to the windows

753
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:39,660
machine and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at what</font>

754
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of information we can get so we</font>

755
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,740
know we can get the comic database file

756
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:45,180
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give us all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

757
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,250
victim data it's going to tell us who

758
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,750
he's infected who's connected to him and

759
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:50,880
that information<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been heavily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> useful</font>

760
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:52,410
but again I started this thing saying I

761
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,119
want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rebuke I want to look at</font>

762
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:57,029
finding out who the attacker is without

763
00:39:54,119 --> 00:40:00,890
bad guys and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at ways</font>

764
00:39:57,029 --> 00:40:00,890
we can get that<font color="#CCCCCC"> information out of them</font>

765
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:28,990
so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to the last demo so if</font>

766
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,119
you're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> this on your home machine</font>

767
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:33,729
then that's fine I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get a lot of</font>

768
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,890
information out of you that way but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

769
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:38,890
you're smarter than that so if you've

770
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:41,410
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself a VPS or if you're running</font>

771
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:43,089
some hosted service somewhere so hosted

772
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:44,170
linux server or hosted<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows server</font>

773
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:46,180
you you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a layer of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> abstraction</font>

774
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:47,230
so all the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to get</font>

775
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:50,049
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information that you're</font>

776
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:50,950
connecting from which isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

777
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,990
give me a lot because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

778
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:54,310
to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to do this standard</font>

779
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:56,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">day-to-day stuff this and allow me to</font>

780
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:59,170
pull files to to figure out who you are

781
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,660
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to give me and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you use a</font>

782
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:03,580
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of imagination so this is a</font>

783
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:06,430
showdown search so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I searched on port</font>

784
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:09,400
1604 varmints off that comment now this

785
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:12,460
is server access corporation they host

786
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,780
VPS is they host windows machines you

787
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,800
pay yourself a bit money and you get a

788
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:19,390
windows machine rdp is enabled<font color="#E5E5E5"> on these</font>

789
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,310
so I know this isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> your mailbox I know</font>

790
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:23,650
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're obstructing yourself but I</font>

791
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:25,750
still want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out who you are not</font>

792
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:28,930
what service are using because this is

793
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:31,300
buried behind all sorts of IP privacy

794
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:33,339
layers I can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> running 3389 so</font>

795
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:35,590
I know you're running IDP well

796
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:37,150
thankfully windows logs all this and

797
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:38,619
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the dark comic</font>

798
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:42,240
connection I can reach in and grab any

799
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:44,859
file alike so if i can grab event logs

800
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,950
and look at your login events and look

801
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:49,660
for type 10 logins I've got your IP

802
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:51,640
address so that's our period dress you

803
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:54,009
connected from wherever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

804
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:56,410
controlling this from<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to that I DP</font>

805
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:57,760
machine so even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're given yourself</font>

806
00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:00,250
that layer of abstraction I can still

807
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,400
find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> who you are that's for windows</font>

808
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:06,190
what if you're not using<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows so this</font>

809
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:09,480
one is a linux machine so doesn't have

810
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:12,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">our DP but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he's got real VNC room</font>

811
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:17,380
realvnc same as everything's going to

812
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:20,200
log in windows stores it in event logs

813
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,609
if you're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a domain these</font>

814
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">things don't run as domains they usually</font>

815
00:42:21,609 --> 00:42:26,500
just standard service to the stood up or

816
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:30,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">Windows machine stood up so we can find</font>

817
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:32,410
it in the update logs on linux again we

818
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,169
can find these logs now those logs

819
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:34,819
contain

820
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:37,010
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of information so they</font>

821
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:40,730
contain the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've</font>

822
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:42,530
connected to that all prom so again

823
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:45,140
bringing that whole attribution<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pete's</font>

824
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:46,970
back in looking at the host and the IP

825
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,890
addresses and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the who is data that falls</font>

826
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:50,959
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I know that you're using</font>

827
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:53,779
some company and yeah I can do some

828
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,369
attribution and say that these IP ranges

829
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:58,130
and these domain names have been used by

830
00:42:55,369 --> 00:43:00,109
this person<font color="#CCCCCC"> before and and this campaign</font>

831
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:01,670
this drag<font color="#CCCCCC"> too but it doesn't tell us</font>

832
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:03,339
where they're actually sitting they just

833
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:05,809
tell us what infrastructure the using

834
00:43:03,339 --> 00:43:07,190
using this<font color="#E5E5E5"> X point reaching in and</font>

00:43:05,809 --> 00:43:09,230
pulling<font color="#E5E5E5"> out these files is going to</font>

836
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:11,450
allow me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify where the attack is</font>

837
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:13,640
actually sitting now they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

838
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:16,669
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of security typically</font>

secure going<font color="#E5E5E5"> from their home machine or</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">who's behind these attacks even if they</font>

849
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:46,040
put that low level of stuff in between

850
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:48,440
them so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually there are many more</font>

851
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,790
file paths and if you use your

852
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:53,599
imagination you're going to find some

853
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:56,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting things and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully I say</font>

00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully a lot</font>

00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:09,719
that's my<font color="#CCCCCC"> pod car running its Windows</font>

00:44:07,059 --> 00:44:09,719
machine again

857
00:44:17,509 --> 00:44:21,499
so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was first looking at what kind</font>

858
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:24,349
of files would contain the most

859
00:44:21,499 --> 00:44:28,488
information about you about<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifying</font>

860
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:30,169
who you are what you do I started

861
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:32,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at the forensics point of view</font>

862
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:35,808
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started looking at trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

863
00:44:32,749 --> 00:44:37,129
Emma tees and files and anything that

864
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:41,059
that's what nature but then I thought

865
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:43,789
there's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy way everybody has an</font>

866
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:47,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet footprint and unless you're</font>

867
00:44:43,789 --> 00:44:49,279
really good with security that footprint

868
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,649
is stored all over your computer if

869
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:54,829
you're using Chrome Firefox or Internet

870
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:56,719
Explorer every time you visit URL it

871
00:44:54,829 --> 00:44:58,339
saved every time you enter a username

00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:01,429
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> password if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you take that save me</font>

874
00:45:01,429 --> 00:45:06,709
every download every URL your visit and

875
00:45:03,499 --> 00:45:09,189
it's all stored in a file and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we've</font>

876
00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:13,759
seen if I know where these files are I

877
00:45:09,189 --> 00:45:16,069
can go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them so in this instance</font>

878
00:45:13,759 --> 00:45:18,309
I'm going to target the chrome<font color="#E5E5E5"> history</font>

879
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:18,308
file

880
00:46:05,509 --> 00:46:09,769
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I told you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before that we need to</font>

881
00:46:07,549 --> 00:46:11,538
know two things one we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know or</font>

882
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:15,499
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to know the relative part of the</font>

883
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:18,139
file or the full file path now it's with

884
00:46:15,499 --> 00:46:20,178
Windows this become difficult so all

885
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:24,079
these files are stored in your username

886
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:27,139
folder so users your username local

887
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">updater local google chrome default your</font>

888
00:46:27,139 --> 00:46:30,499
history files there so we know where<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

889
00:46:28,729 --> 00:46:32,499
get it<font color="#CCCCCC"> well missing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that one key piece</font>

890
00:46:30,499 --> 00:46:34,729
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data we're missing your username</font>

891
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:37,428
without that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult to give</font>

892
00:46:34,729 --> 00:46:40,189
you a full path so what I built into the

893
00:46:37,429 --> 00:46:42,199
script<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a way of identifying the</font>

894
00:46:40,189 --> 00:46:44,359
relative path so all it does is it

895
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:47,959
starts in the directory sin and it goes

896
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:49,999
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> a level and looks for an to user if</font>

897
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:52,428
you find NT user that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it knows it's in</font>

898
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:54,678
the root of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> user folder and from</font>

899
00:46:52,429 --> 00:46:56,630
there I can then just go back up so it's

900
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:58,819
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a dot slash slash and then</font>

901
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:00,529
back up the chain and they'll do that

902
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:03,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">for any operating system so if it's on</font>

903
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:05,989
Linux it will scan down directories

904
00:47:03,139 --> 00:47:09,109
until it finds a path it knows it can

905
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:11,029
then relatively go back up if it's on

906
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:12,679
windows XP or go down into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> finest</font>

907
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:15,169
documents and settings find itself in

908
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:16,759
the root user and they go back up so I

909
00:47:15,169 --> 00:47:19,069
don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know your username in</font>

910
00:47:16,759 --> 00:47:20,959
order to access that information is

911
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:27,439
stored in like your updates for them to

912
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:30,279
user name so again in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show</font>

913
00:47:27,439 --> 00:47:33,558
you some real interesting information

914
00:47:30,279 --> 00:47:35,689
I've grabbed a history file which was

915
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:38,089
freely available<font color="#E5E5E5"> in internet you be</font>

916
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:41,178
surprised how much people eat this data

917
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:44,049
aren't internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> virustotal is absolutely</font>

918
00:47:41,179 --> 00:47:47,630
full of history files through life files

919
00:47:44,049 --> 00:47:49,249
login files and that connector so to

920
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:51,529
show you the kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> real world data</font>

921
00:47:49,249 --> 00:47:55,939
that you can find in these I've got one

922
00:47:51,529 --> 00:47:59,119
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those ones and again I can appreciate</font>

923
00:47:55,939 --> 00:48:00,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">this not very easy to read so what we're</font>

924
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at here is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a chrome</font>

925
00:48:00,589 --> 00:48:06,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">issue file in there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enlist</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every file</font>

926
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:08,630
it's ever been downloaded so it gives me

927
00:48:06,829 --> 00:48:11,839
the full path so I know know that your

928
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:13,399
name is thumbtack so I've now got that

929
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:15,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">for path a full path I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was missing</font>

930
00:48:13,399 --> 00:48:17,890
before the force me to do this relative

931
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:20,260
websearch don't need it anymore I've got

932
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:23,140
used name from there I've also<font color="#E5E5E5"> got every</font>

933
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:24,940
file you've ever saved and if you scan

934
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:26,980
through this list you'll find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

935
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:30,580
somebody actually downloaded my

passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot txt saved into his folder</font>

937
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:35,350
well that was great because you've now

938
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,000
told me you've downloaded it and this

939
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:39,370
history file tells me exactly where that

940
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,500
far<font color="#E5E5E5"> sup I go back into my doctor when</font>

941
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:43,210
exploit that my password<font color="#E5E5E5"> text file</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comes</font>

942
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:45,310
straight down to our machine so I put

943
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:46,540
your passwords file open it up and

944
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:48,880
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of information though</font>

945
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:51,580
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just tells me that your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gmail colon</font>

house this password your FTP house this

947
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:58,299
password so we need some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

948
00:48:55,210 --> 00:49:03,160
getting your usernames out like we said

949
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:05,080
before Google's pretty good at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

950
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,629
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things it saves in here as</font>

951
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:11,100
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as saving the full URL it actually</font>

952
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:11,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">saves the email address as well</font>

953
00:49:17,019 --> 00:49:20,709
there are no<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopes we plumped them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

954
00:49:19,299 --> 00:49:24,189
because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know who this</font>

955
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:26,259
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> is but that's his google account</font>

956
00:49:24,189 --> 00:49:27,999
that's his email address<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can see</font>

957
00:49:26,259 --> 00:49:30,640
other accounts being created and roughly

958
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:31,928
into that email<font color="#CCCCCC"> address if we go through</font>

959
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:37,749
like I said we're looking at find out

960
00:49:31,929 --> 00:49:40,419
who this<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy is so there are about three</font>

961
00:49:37,749 --> 00:49:41,948
and a half thousand entries and they

962
00:49:40,419 --> 00:49:48,149
cover everything from torrents<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

963
00:49:41,949 --> 00:49:52,719
downloading school history syllabuses

964
00:49:48,149 --> 00:49:54,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">public library so pretty much everything</font>

965
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:58,959
you'd need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> geolocate them is in this</font>

966
00:49:54,219 --> 00:50:00,999
in this file those are the files we can

967
00:49:58,959 --> 00:50:04,509
get login data again it's a steal our

968
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:07,658
database file that contains your<font color="#CCCCCC"> URL</font>

969
00:50:04,509 --> 00:50:08,949
your username and encrypted password the

encrypted password you're not going to

971
00:50:08,949 --> 00:50:13,269
be breaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> so anytime soon it's it's</font>

972
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:15,189
done in Windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need the windows api</font>

973
00:50:13,269 --> 00:50:18,459
and his windows credentials in order to

974
00:50:15,189 --> 00:50:20,469
decrypt that but we got it so he had

975
00:50:18,459 --> 00:50:21,819
that password<font color="#E5E5E5"> text file we sold as the</font>

976
00:50:20,469 --> 00:50:23,469
password we correlate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> against the</font>

977
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:26,349
login data and we've got all that

978
00:50:23,469 --> 00:50:29,259
information we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> so like said with a</font>

little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of imagination you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> these files it's not just chrome</font>

981
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:35,408
firefox does the same windows is the

982
00:50:32,919 --> 00:50:38,019
same some very interesting files you can

983
00:50:35,409 --> 00:50:40,739
reach out grab them and identify who

984
00:50:38,019 --> 00:50:40,738
your attacker is

any questions
