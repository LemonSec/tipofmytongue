00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,790
know I was planning on doing that if

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:09,030
please do sorry anyone word for word or

16
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:11,450
a rough approximation anyone tell me the

17
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,450
language

18
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:26,530
Klingon yes you get the prize yeah I was

19
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:30,660
going to say please do not ask me to say

20
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,660
anymore because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned that for this</font>

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:42,509
so there was a point to that it wasn't

22
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:45,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">just to have a bit of fun and that was</font>

23
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:49,750
to understand language you need a

24
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:52,270
context so you hear the tune and maybe

25
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:55,240
you start to get what it is but actually

26
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:58,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">without a translation it's very hard to</font>

27
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,949
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody says so you can speak</font>

28
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:02,380
a different language and without the

29
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:05,649
exact translation you won't know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

30
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:09,130
was saying bite me spin spin make my

31
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:10,419
feet spin now fighting hi glad you

32
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,690
didn't understand to be honest<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

33
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:20,738
on any one rushing the stage and

34
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:22,810
fighting me but so I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to open up</font>

35
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:24,940
my talk today which is about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

36
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,930
raise awareness and communicate better

37
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:31,450
with users general users and with that

38
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,829
demonstration as a way of saying we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

39
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:36,730
a different language and i'll be talking

40
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:39,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">about language a fair bit today and the</font>

41
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,929
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> was to say that without context</font>

42
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,850
and without an understanding of the

43
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,860
words being said without speaking the

44
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:48,310
same language then you may as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well be</font>

45
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:51,190
speaking Klingon so I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jessica Parker</font>

46
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,350
I work as an independent consultant and

47
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:57,820
my work is all around the human side of

48
00:02:53,350 --> 00:03:01,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">cyber security so I look at users user</font>

49
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:04,750
behavior user awareness and and I work

50
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:07,360
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> organisations to kind of bridge</font>

51
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,690
that gap between technology and the

52
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">average user and I'm talking today about</font>

53
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,230
awareness raising and about how we can

54
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:16,060
better communicate with users my

55
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,040
backgrounds in sociology and politics

56
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:22,120
with a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> psychology and that's kind</font>

57
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,980
of what I I bring to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> subject</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

58
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,069
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I move on to talk a bit more</font>

59
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,768
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'll be going</font>

60
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:29,540
back to language I did a bit of a tiny

61
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:32,209
bit of research last week so I did a

62
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,409
survey of 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and I asked them</font>

63
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:37,069
how worried they are about<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber</font>

64
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:38,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">security for one question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

65
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:40,249
something I'm often interested in and

66
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's works I do for clients as well as</font>

67
00:03:40,249 --> 00:03:43,370
look at their consumers and see how

68
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,108
worried they are about issues and

69
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:48,980
information security and what that means

70
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:50,629
for organizations and we can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

71
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:54,858
people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually people quite worried</font>

72
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:57,530
so the average score was 6.3 not

73
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:59,629
massively high but above terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

74
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,489
so it was on a scale of not at all

75
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:05,290
worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> too very worried and people put</font>

76
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:08,510
it kind of in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the higher than medium if</font>

77
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,879
we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at nine to ten compared to one</font>

78
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,798
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> two so if we look at very worried as</font>

79
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,168
opposed to not worried at all we can see

80
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,820
that it's double so people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually</font>

81
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:20,900
kind of quite worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this subject</font>

82
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:23,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">I then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked them do the same group of</font>

83
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:25,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">people and do you feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know how</font>

84
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to stay safe online and I was quite</font>

85
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,090
surprised with these results but

86
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:32,270
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vast majority of people do</font>

87
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:35,060
feel they know how to stay safe<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least</font>

88
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:37,340
all of the time or sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

89
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:40,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">about 70 odd percent that say either yes</font>

90
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:43,549
they do or they at least do sometimes so

91
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are worried they feel like they</font>

92
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,690
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do but we can all say that</font>

93
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,580
human behavior online is not

94
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,099
particularly safe so while people may

95
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,630
feel they know what to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and then not</font>

96
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:55,460
putting those practices into place

97
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,800
they're still clicking on dodgy links

98
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:01,690
they're still using<font color="#CCCCCC"> passwords</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the</font>

99
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:05,000
behaviors<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are used to seeing and</font>

100
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:07,009
one of those reasons is language one of

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,570
the reasons is talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to users how we</font>

102
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:10,969
talk to users how we make them

103
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:13,669
understand the behaviors they should be

104
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:15,500
engaging in and actually encouraging

105
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:18,229
them to do so so I've got another

106
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,919
example of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> power of language and</font>

107
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:20,919
translation

108
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,560
so what you'll hear is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sentence a</font>

109
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:33,659
spoken sentence that's been transformed

110
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,659
by a computer to sound like gibberish so

111
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:41,948
any idea what they said no<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay anyone</font>

112
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:46,000
got any ideas anyone who hasn't heard

113
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:52,870
that before got any idea what that

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,940
message was sorry something was in a

115
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:58,629
bumblebee nothing was in a bumblebee

116
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:03,690
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> track uh you can hear it one more</font>

117
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:07,659
time ok now we'll hear the real sentence

118
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:09,729
any after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second attempt no it's</font>

119
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:13,740
complete<font color="#CCCCCC"> obligate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't it the</font>

120
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">Constitution Center</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is at the next stop</font>

121
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:20,949
so there we have the translation and it

122
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:22,780
played again did everybody hear that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

123
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:25,180
we'll go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start does it make</font>

124
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,460
sense that time yeah it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a</font>

125
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,349
sentence a spoken sentence that's been

126
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:36,279
transformed by a computer to sound like

127
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:41,860
gibberish so any idea what they said no

128
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:43,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok uh you can hear it one more time ok</font>

129
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,580
now we'll hear the real sentence the

130
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:51,039
Constitution Center we've got the next

131
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:52,779
stop does it make sense that time yeah

132
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,128
wait was that the same exact same

133
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:57,099
sentence that you heard the first time

134
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:59,050
no way it's the exact same said that

135
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:00,849
your brain is always using prior

136
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:04,419
information to make sense of new

137
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:06,789
information coming in so so did everyone

138
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:09,370
hear the sentence was the Constitution

139
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:10,719
Center is at the next stop and when

140
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've had the translation and you</font>

141
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:13,870
listen to the garbled message you can

142
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:15,128
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear it if people want to hear that</font>

143
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,349
again put your hands up I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

144
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:18,729
keep kind of playing it and you can find

145
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:21,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">it on soundcloud but if you want to hear</font>

146
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:22,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">it again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm happy to play it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

148
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:25,930
researcher there was making and the

149
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,580
point that I'm trying to make is you

150
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,639
only understand language when it's in a

151
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,570
context when you have prior information

152
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,420
so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a knowledge base</font>

153
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,010
already to translate it for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

154
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,850
exactly the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the Klingon and the</font>

155
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:42,370
hat shop if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know the words if</font>

156
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:44,020
you don't know the context and then it's

157
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">just all sounds like gobbledygook it all</font>

158
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,890
sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a computer talking and often</font>

159
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with users we use a</font>

160
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:52,450
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> technical language in this industry</font>

161
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:54,400
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't translate it if we don't</font>

162
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:56,740
put it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a context they understand and</font>

163
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,120
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> users won't engage they will</font>

164
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:02,560
literally won't understand what we're

165
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about with language I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

166
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,720
if there's anyone else<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Newcastle in</font>

168
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,760
put the lamp<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tom womb into a talk I'm</font>

00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:20,020
after party and that's a threat<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font>

171
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:22,060
promise but language there are there is

172
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,469
slang and there is jargon and they're

173
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually very similar although</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

174
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,510
kind of opposite ends of the scale slang

175
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:31,030
is informal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of used and has</font>

176
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,650
grown in an informal way and jargon is

177
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:36,130
very formal and is often used in a

178
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:39,970
professional way but they often perform

179
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:42,370
the same functions so slang and jargon

180
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:45,520
both are kind of short cuts their ways

181
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,230
of saying things quickly and to

182
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,750
communicate a meaning without having to

183
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,790
explain everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind it so i'm</font>

184
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,550
going to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> later about rationality</font>

185
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,110
and if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are any other sociologists</font>

186
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,670
in the room when I say rationality you

187
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,680
will automatically know what that means

188
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,780
if you haven't studied sociology or

189
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,449
history you might not have that shortcut

190
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,490
to know exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it means so that's</font>

191
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,520
one function they have another function

192
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:11,860
they have is to unify a group so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

193
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,620
asked if anybody from you castle is here

194
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,180
if they get that meaning and a few

195
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,890
people in the room are from the same

196
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,449
place as me so they are familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

197
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,360
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lampton whim</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have just</font>

198
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">identified kind of my one of my groups</font>

199
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,310
in a way people who are from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

200
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,140
place as me and that's a purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

201
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,390
partly why we use slang and also why we

202
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:35,110
use jargon it's a way of kind of saying

203
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:38,920
we belong to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same group so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

204
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:41,320
kind of feel a kinship and it's also as

205
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,500
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way of marking kind of there for those</font>

206
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,850
who belong and those who don't belong so

207
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,740
if you understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saying</font>

208
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,230
then you kind of belong with me but if

209
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't if I speak in this way and you</font>

210
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't get it and I'm excluding you and</font>

211
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:58,209
you kind of don't belong to this group

212
00:09:54,209 --> 00:10:01,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this idea of social identity</font>

213
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:04,329
theory when you speak the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same language</font>

214
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:06,339
and exclude others then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are kind of</font>

215
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:08,529
identifying with<font color="#CCCCCC"> your group and social</font>

216
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:11,440
identity theory is a sociological theory

217
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:13,720
and it's all about group membership and

218
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,910
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about having signposts that mean</font>

219
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,529
you are part of a group and those who

220
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:20,170
aren't part of your group are excluded

221
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:22,810
and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of not a part of your</font>

222
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:26,050
subculture and I think we see this a lot

223
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:27,910
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our industry social identity theory</font>

224
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:30,069
is a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of kind of building up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font>

225
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:33,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">self-esteem it's a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you take</font>

226
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:36,130
pride I know nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about football but</font>

227
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,480
I was brought up in Newcastle thinking

228
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,730
that newcastle united's are the best

229
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,459
thing ever and therefore obviously so am

230
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">i because I'm from Newcastle so it's</font>

231
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:46,149
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an example football is one way and</font>

232
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:49,990
that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a kind of social</font>

233
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:52,149
identity and we use this to build up our

234
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,880
pride ourself esteem or so to unite us

235
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:58,139
as a group but it also has this effect

236
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">of excluding people and I often think in</font>

237
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:03,610
infosec we have a kind of others in

238
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,109
their approach in terms of the people in

239
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,689
the industry people who are sore

240
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:12,459
technology orientated and people who

241
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:15,189
aren't the everyday user and you see it

242
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:17,649
a lot you see a lot of media reports you

243
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:19,569
see it a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> on Twitter and it's this</font>

244
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:21,880
idea that we are knowledgeable in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

245
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:26,769
industry and people who don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

246
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:29,380
same knowledge of us are stupid so we

247
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,970
can see it in that register article the

248
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">biggest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem in impose a guy middle</font>

out who said it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> infosec is hard</font>

254
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:50,259
basically the user the user is a disease

00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:52,449
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an idiot quite an extreme example</font>

256
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:55,829
but you see this undercurrent quite a

257
00:11:52,449 --> 00:11:55,829
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of blaming the user</font>

258
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,790
and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this actually is is victim</font>

259
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,920
blaming the user is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the biggest</font>

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem in infosec the biggest problem</font>

261
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,660
in infosec are of course the attackers

262
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,150
are the criminals who are engaging in

263
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">criminal activity and they are the ones</font>

264
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:16,880
who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously causing the problem</font>

265
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:20,000
victim-blaming has been around for a

266
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,860
very long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time it used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a sort of</font>

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,190
recognized and reputable part of

268
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:28,480
criminology so for a long time police

269
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:31,790
and criminologists used a typology of

270
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,340
victimhood to define how much a victim

271
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:37,490
was responsible for a crime it ran from

272
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">one to six one being a victim was</font>

completely innocent up to five and<font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

274
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:46,220
where the victim was entirely

responsible and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was recognized and</font>

276
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,310
accepted and it was seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> as kind of</font>

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">normal that a victim could be</font>

they started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be challenged and it was</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of sociologists called Timmer</font>

victimhood is a disease<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a problem</font>

and that if you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a victim then you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">are asking for it and what they said is</font>

296
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,079
infosec because it's very damaging for

297
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,370
someone's self-esteem to tell them that

they're protecting people who are

us to have a knowledge base and also a

324
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,860
better we need to understand how they

00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:50,689
think how they make decisions and also

326
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,940
why there is this gap between awareness

327
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,760
and behavior we've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rise in</font>

328
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:58,070

329
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:00,170
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year alone there was a rise</font>

330
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:02,600
in media reporting of something like

331
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:04,819
four hundred percent in infosec so it

332
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:10,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">went from I think four thousand news</font>

333
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:12,200
stories last year to 25,000 this year so

334
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,600
there's a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> public appetite for</font>

00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,220
privacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and security stories</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> awareness</font>

336
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">is probably higher than ever before but</font>

337
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,550
behaviors aren't changing and this is

338
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we don't we haven't fully</font>

339
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:24,109
comprehended the emotional and the

340
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,859
psychological aspects<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this subject</font>

341
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:31,250
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think one way that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

342
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,200
understand this better is to look at em

343
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,960
other fields so that for example

344
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,020
behavioral economics behavioral

345
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,820
economics and is all about understanding

346
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:44,480
how people behave why they behave and

347
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:48,350
they look at heuristics<font color="#E5E5E5"> or kind of rules</font>

348
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,990
of thumb so behavioral economics says

349
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,330
that behind every decision we make their

350
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,670
reserves of an unconscious set of

351
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:58,430
structures like the scaffolding that

352
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:00,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">will lead to that decision and we won't</font>

353
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:02,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">really be aware of it it won't be a</font>

354
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,130
logical and conscious decision that we

355
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,660
necessarily make but it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

356
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,120
triggered<font color="#CCCCCC"> by all sorts of things that</font>

357
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,850
are going on in<font color="#CCCCCC"> our brain and decisions</font>

358
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:14,060
we make a very context driven and very

359
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:17,010
context orientated so decisions we make

360
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:19,800
will come from previous experiences

361
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:24,360
and they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of fitting to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

362
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:26,790
context that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're in one big subject</font>

363
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,520
that behavioral economics talk about is

364
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:32,339
priming and priming is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

365
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,260
idea that that something happens or is

366
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:38,090
said to you and accuse sort of

367
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:40,410
downstream behaviors so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

368
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:42,210
there's been a lot of research done<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

369
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:44,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">finds if you tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people stories of</font>

370
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:46,680
achievement or success before they go

371
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:48,750
into an exam and then they will do

372
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:52,800
better even if you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> would use words</font>

373
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:54,750
like achieve success and greatness all

374
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">these kind of positive words people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

375
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:59,400
better likewise<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> engage with</font>

376
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:01,140
negative stereotypes people will do

377
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,510
worse so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most depressing</font>

378
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,250
findings for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me personally was if you</font>

379
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,930
tell a woman she's a woman if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> remind</font>

380
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,449
her that she's a woman before she goes

381
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:13,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">into an exam she will do worse than if</font>

382
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:15,780
she just goes in it was a study done in

383
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,819
America they found if you tell an Asian

384
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,709
American woman she's a woman before she

385
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:21,359
goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> in she'll do worse but if you</font>

386
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:23,160
remind her that she's Asian American

387
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:27,359
she'll do better because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the positive</font>

388
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:30,030
stereotype of working hard associated

389
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,919
with that ethnicity so stereotypes

390
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:33,480
really matter and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to people</font>

391
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,990
and how we<font color="#CCCCCC"> prime them is really</font>

392
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,520
important if you see me talk before

393
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,620
you'll have heard me<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about the</font>

394
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,710
Pygmalion effect and the Golem effect

395
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,389
the Pygmalion effect is basically if we

396
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:48,570
expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of people we tend to get a</font>

397
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:51,510
lot back so it's based on a study called

398
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:53,730
Pygmalion in the classroom it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

399
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:56,850
by a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sociologists who took</font>

400
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,290
school students and they told some of

401
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">them their teacher told some of them</font>

402
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,399
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well and the</font>

403
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,409
teacher took others and didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell them</font>

404
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,390
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the ones that were told they</font>

405
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:09,510
would do really well performed higher

406
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:11,250
than had been expected of them so how we

407
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,500
speak to people how we engage with them

408
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,530
what we expect of them is really

409
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,900
important the opposite of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is the</font>

410
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:21,930
Golem effect and it comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jewish</font>

411
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:25,100
mythology and it's the idea of rabbis

412
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:29,630
building golems buildings of life like

413
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:31,340
man like creatures out of mud and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

414
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:34,610
happens in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the main myths is that</font>

415
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:36,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">a rabbi creates a golem and kinda</font>

416
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:39,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't take responsibility for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

417
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:43,039
doesn't train it and educate it and the

418
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">Golem goes off and causes destruction so</font>

419
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,129
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Golem effect is seen as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the opposite</font>

420
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,240
of the Pygmalion effect which is

421
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:49,429
basically if you don't take

422
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,100
responsibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> for people and that you</font>

423
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:55,460
are teaching if you don't engage in

424
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:59,719
positive stereotypes then they tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

425
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:02,450
do worse and perform more poorly this is

426
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:07,340
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture of Descartes I mentioned</font>

427
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:08,750
earlier and rationalism and rationalism

428
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,629
was kind of predominant in the

429
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,950
nineteenth and twentieth century

430
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:16,669
rationalism led to a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

431
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:18,500
discoveries but one core problem with

432
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:20,809
rationalism and the idea that we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

433
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,789
rational beings and is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it thinks</font>

434
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:25,190
that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> only conscious cognition</font>

435
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:26,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">that everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and think and</font>

436
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,330
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our behaviors can be quantified</font>

437
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:32,150
can be measured can be broken down and

438
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:34,399
understood and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was often what we</font>

439
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,600
expect of users we think their behavior

440
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,570
can be understood<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think they should</font>

441
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,770
be rational when they're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a laptop but</font>

442
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:42,620
we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we know that</font>

443
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:45,408
users for example I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> forty-six</font>

444
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:49,939
percent of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who have clicked on a</font>

445
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:51,770
fishing link or a spam link they know

446
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,179
that they're engaging in risky behavior

447
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,549
they know that they are doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

448
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:56,990
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> likely and to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have negative</font>

449
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:58,870
consequences but they do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway</font>

450
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:04,190
because they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't help themselves</font>

451
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:05,500
or they are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of curious so that's</font>

452
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:08,809
the reason I'm drawing on rationality

453
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,730
because we're expecting users to always

454
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:12,200
engage in conscious thought and always

455
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:16,000
be rational<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we know that they're</font>

456
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:18,799
they're actually not for more useful

457
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,600
approaches to use a behavior we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can look</font>

458
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,720
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> British enlightenment and look at</font>

459
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:28,549
ideas of unconscious cognition and the

460
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:31,220
importance of our unconscious the

461
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:32,750
unconscious is impulsive it likes good

462
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:36,140
feelings and it wants a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

463
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:38,070
immediate and good response and the

464
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,630
unconscious brain is often

465
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,480
constable for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of our decisions and</font>

466
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:46,620
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our actions it has a much more</font>

467
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">powerful and processing ability than the</font>

468
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,139
conscious brain so at its highest

469
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,770
potential the conscious brain is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 200,000</font>

470
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,910
times weaker than the unconscious brain

471
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:59,660
so what basically happens when you're

472
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:02,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">learning something new is you engage</font>

473
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,140
with your conscious brain and then once

474
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,120
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> learned it you download that</font>

475
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">knowledge into your unconscious brain</font>

476
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,780
and that's all you need going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forwards</font>

477
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,740
you don't have to consciously think

478
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:15,840
about what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is why</font>

479
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,490
once you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned to drive and the</font>

480
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">information and the knowledge and the</font>

481
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,090
skills have been downloaded<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your</font>

482
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,760
conscience and conscious brain this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

483
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:25,679
why you can drive home and hardly

484
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,200
remember the journey and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get</font>

485
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,340
home and think I was asleep basically

486
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,510
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I didn't seem to be paying</font>

487
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,090
attention anything could have happened

488
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:35,190
how did I make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that journey alive and</font>

489
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:37,139
not killing anyone well you did that

490
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,940
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're unconscious brain was</font>

491
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,730
working for you you didn't need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

492
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,990
consciously because you already had all

493
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:47,760
of the skills and the knowledge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

494
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:51,960
awareness in your unconscious brain Karl

495
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:54,180
Popper who is a Austrian philosopher he

496
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,980
talks<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the analogy of clocks and</font>

497
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,960
clouds when it comes to human behavior

498
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,480
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> human thought and what he basically</font>

499
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,300
says is clocks are neat and they're

500
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,030
orderly and they can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken apart and</font>

501
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:08,310
dissected and understood whereas clouds

502
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:10,950
are messy and they're dynamic and they

503
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:14,970
change by the second and they're much

504
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:18,120
harder therefore to<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze to study and</font>

505
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:20,100
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand and he basically says we</font>

506
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,949
think too often that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the brain is a</font>

507
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:25,199
clock and that human behavior is a clock

508
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:27,870
and can be dissected and understood like

509
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">an engineering problem when in fact the</font>

510
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:32,610
brain and human behavior<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like a cloud</font>

511
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:34,920
it changes by the second it's very hard

512
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:38,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">to study and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand and to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apply</font>

513
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:40,860
rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and it's very dynamic it's sort</font>

514
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,960
of very movable so we need to understand

515
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:46,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> brain and humans more like clouds</font>

516
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,020
than clocks the brain is an ecosystem

517
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,560
it's a set of parallel

518
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:53,420
processes that are all working at once

519
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:57,409
and you'll all know about kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign</font>

520
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:59,930
apses and synoptic connections which is

521
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:02,020
basically when I see a cat for the first

522
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:05,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">time I have to be told this is a cat and</font>

523
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,920
neurons fire in my brain and I start to

524
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:09,170
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is a cat the more I</font>

525
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,000
see cats the more i become to understand

526
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:13,280
what cats are and the differences

527
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">between different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> types of cats and then</font>

528
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,580
those connections get stronger and

529
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,860
stronger<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stronger and so my thought</font>

530
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,320
processes around cats gets very much

531
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:24,199
stronger much quicker much more

532
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:26,659
efficient so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can tell cats apart</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

533
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,390
see a cat just from its shape my

534
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:35,030
understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cattiness is much</font>

535
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:36,710
greater and this is what you need to

536
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">build up unconscious thought you need to</font>

537
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,340
see and recognize and understand things

538
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:44,570
more and more and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we</font>

539
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:47,870
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with users we need to engage</font>

540
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:51,290
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> their conscious brain so they</font>

541
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:54,110
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> and engage in behaviors that</font>

542
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:55,490
are much more secure in a way they keep

543
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">on learning keep on building up those</font>

544
00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:01,520
connections to then download that into

545
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:03,380
their unconscious brain and there is a

546
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,790
quote<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a book that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I recently read</font>

547
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,780
that talks a lot about this and I would

548
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend it it's called the social</font>

549
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,980
animal and it's by a guy called David

550
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,600
Brooks and he said humans succeed

551
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:15,020
because they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability to develop</font>

552
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,480
advanced cultures to understand any kind

553
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,730
of threat or anything in society we need

554
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of scaffold of culture we need</font>

555
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:24,140
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that helps us understand and</font>

556
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,180
work together and share this knowledge

557
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:29,870
and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

558
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:31,430
up with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> users when I talk about</font>

559
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:34,219
unconscious thought and the power of

560
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:36,440
unconscious thought you could then argue

561
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well well what's the point you know</font>

562
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,860
if the if the conscious brain has no

563
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,659
power how can we engage with the

564
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,149
unconscious brain and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a</font>

565
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:46,610
difference and there's a good analogy i

566
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:49,010
recently read about it which is

567
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:51,709
unconscious emotions have supremacy but

568
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:54,379
not dictatorship so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

569
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:56,960
brain like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera a camera has an</font>

570
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:59,480
automatic function and a manual function

571
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,700
the automatic function is fast

572
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,040
and it's quick and it sort of has

573
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,860
instantaneous results but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not at</font>

574
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:09,530
all flexible the manual function is

575
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:11,479
slower but it's more controlled and so

576
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,000
when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end users</font>

577
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,240
we need to be encouraging them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> engage</font>

578
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,320
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of manual function and</font>

579
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:23,840
engage with conscious thought to

580
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:25,370
override unconscious thought so coming

581
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">on to kind of the final bit of my</font>

582
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,969
presentation is to talk about

583
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">empowerment and empowerment is an</font>

584
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:35,480
important theme in information security

585
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:38,870
the definition<font color="#CCCCCC"> of empowerment is to give</font>

586
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,180
somebody power a role of responsibility

587
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:43,129
and to be able to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

588
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:45,230
authority and the ability to do

589
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:48,260
something and it's also to make someone

590
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:49,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel stronger and more confident and</font>

591
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:52,220
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can impact</font>

592
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,440
on empowerment the language<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a really</font>

593
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,960
important one engaging<font color="#E5E5E5"> in more positive</font>

594
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:00,080
language rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> a kind of negative</font>

595
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,970
language that we saw earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font>

596
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,379
terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> victim blaming but there's also</font>

597
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:06,200
lots of things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do in an</font>

598
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:08,390
organization so setting a vision having

599
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,730
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> strategy having a mission making sure</font>

600
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:12,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">people understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

601
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:15,740
done and when and kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having a set</font>

602
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,660
of road maps in place raising education

603
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,970
and awareness but<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing so in a way that</font>

604
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,440
people understand the why so not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

605
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,390
telling people what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can and can't</font>

606
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,210
do by telling them<font color="#E5E5E5"> why they should be</font>

607
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:28,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing it making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that people feel</font>

608
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:33,710
that they can engage<font color="#E5E5E5"> in asking questions</font>

609
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,940
and conflict and challenging people so

610
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:38,120
that they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of empowered enough</font>

611
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:41,050
to for example and stop someone coming

612
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:43,639
in without a badge on or tailgating

613
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:44,990
roles and responsibilities is a really

614
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,690
important thing when it comes to

615
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:50,900
empowerment so a study was conducted

616
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:53,930
around mental health<font color="#CCCCCC"> and alcohol abuse</font>

617
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:56,090
and it was basically how to keep people

618
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:59,240
and engaging in positive behavior when

619
00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:02,270
they want to sort of change<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

620
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">relationship</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with alcohol and this study</font>

621
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:06,889
found it was a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> support group of</font>

622
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,960
people with mental<font color="#CCCCCC"> health and alcohol</font>

623
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:11,210
abuse issues and it found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more</font>

624
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,670
they had a role in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the group that they</font>

625
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,830
were

626
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,540
longing to the more empowered<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were</font>

627
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,250
and the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> likely they were to engage</font>

628
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">in positive behaviors and stick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

629
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,960
group so there was kind of a scale of

630
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:24,180
membership of the group going from just

631
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,760
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> along to meetings to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

632
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:29,490
mentoring someone to setting a strategy

633
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:32,610
to being on the board and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> higher up</font>

634
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:34,500
the scale attendees went in terms of

635
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:37,530
empowerment the more likely they were to

636
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,780
change their behaviors for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> positive</font>

637
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:41,610
so in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information security we</font>

638
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,500
can think about that in an organization

639
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:45,209
and having kind of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> roles for</font>

640
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:49,650
people having this idea of ambassadors

641
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:51,840
and champions horizontal working is also

642
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:53,400
really important<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting people to work</font>

643
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,189
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> groups and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people from different</font>

644
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:59,490
departments working together so from HR

645
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:01,770
and legal comms all working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

646
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:03,390
infosec problem and this is not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

647
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,310
make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it kind of spreads wider</font>

648
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,860
in an organization but it's also really

649
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:11,159
important in terms of empowerment and

650
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:13,530
actually problem solving so study found

651
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,090
and there's this card game called the

652
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:17,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm not sure if i'm pronouncing it right</font>

653
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:20,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wausau nor the wastelands selection</font>

654
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:22,379
card game<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if anybody knows</font>

655
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:25,409
it but it's very difficult it's very

656
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:27,530
complicated and a study found that 75%

657
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:30,030
of groups completed this game

658
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:32,220
successfully but only nine percent of

659
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:34,260
individuals did so when we work together

660
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:39,420
as a group we're more likely to be able

661
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:40,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">to solve complicated problems thank you</font>

662
