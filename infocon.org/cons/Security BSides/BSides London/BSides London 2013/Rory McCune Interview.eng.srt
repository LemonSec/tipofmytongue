slightly different talk it's more about

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,849
the process at Penn testings I've been

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,530
in testing though from a seven or<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,450
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> now one of the things I see around</font>

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,799
that is missed opportunities to automate

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,420
too many things faster the big problem

8
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,279
testers have<font color="#E5E5E5"> got on the main problem is</font>

9
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,500
speeded you don't have time to do the

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,939
job so<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do to automate</font>

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,619
that and make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> faster so it's really</font>

12
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,660
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an accumulation of my experiences</font>

13
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,859
and saying this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I think how I've</font>

14
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,210
addressed it and how other people might

15
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to address it so give food for</font>

16
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,970
thought more than anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

17
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,380
more about the kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> preparation and</font>

18
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,699
saying here's how you can prepare so

19
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,170
learning a language learning the tools

20
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,850
that go with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> no sharpen your saw</font>

21
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,620
before you get started and then actually

22
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">when you get on a test effective use of</font>

23
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,519
your time so here's problems which you

24
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,899
can effectively address quickly rather

25
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,460
than spending a lot of time as a diving

26
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,079
away testers are terrible for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

27
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,190
shiny thing I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dive in there</font>

28
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,750
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is more about saying well</font>

29
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,460
portion effort think about some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

30
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,510
key messages get your effort right you

31
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,850
know do the right amount work for the

32
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,050
right result if you're a tester what you

33
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,039
tend to do is you'll encounter new

34
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,788
technologies as you go through each test

35
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,960
that could be a product you've never

36
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:02,340
seen before it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a technology</font>

37
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,840
will never seen before and if you like

38
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,460
me what you'll do that point it'll go

39
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,170
away new researcher you'll start looking

40
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,419
at stuff up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google you start looking</font>

41
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,130
the documentation to the vendor and if

42
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,080
you're like me you'll forget about

43
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">afternoon to the test you'll forget what</font>

44
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,500
it was you learned the little you know

45
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,509
walk exact URL path is that product

46
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,729
goddess administration interface on well

47
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,080
here's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea try scripting it I mean</font>

48
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,400
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a really great example if you</font>

49
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,869
do testing you might well use nickel

50
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,150
Nick does a great example of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our I don't</font>

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,590

myadmin is likely to be on because I run

<font color="#E5E5E5">necktie on that why would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I remember why</font>

54
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,939
would i memorize that stuff it's

55
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,979
pointless it's just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> partha site so in</font>

56
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,839
code knowledge is a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good way or a</font>

57
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,009
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason to do more automation I was</font>

58
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,079
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprised I got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accepted i'll be</font>

59
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,640
honest i Luke to my topic and I looked

60
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,960
all the other you know 61 presentations

61
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,130
i think it was there oh and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought</font>

62
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,658
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no chance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm getting in and</font>

63
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,158
then i thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm on the main track and</font>

64
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">i was surprised i was genuinely</font>

65
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,490
surprised but then maybe that she was a

66
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,840
bit of interest you know people are

67
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,670
doing a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> texts more people come to</font>

68
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,869
testing and actually seeing well here's

69
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,979
how you can make it better<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you're</font>

70
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,420
thinking how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better at this</font>

71
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,170
how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> i improve and hopefully</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i've</font>

72
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,969
been doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up there</font>

73
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">something to say the one I did was if</font>

74
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:02,939
you're coding and it's a funny as a

75
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,680
technical piece advice is you source

76
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,779
code control so put your code somewhere

77
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,220
where if you lose it your machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

78
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,628
lose your system it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be safe</font>

79
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,859
it's like back up since you used backups

80
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:12,679
there's a really mundane piece of advice

81
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,939
bit so make it'll get stung buyer

82
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,019
you're doing a piece of work you're off

83
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:16,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">in one system and then you go where did</font>

84
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:18,109
that go and I've lost it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> suddenly</font>

85
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,000
all that work that effort that time is

86
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:23,140
gone so it was just that's a very basic

87
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,140
thing but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's something is important</font>

88
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,420
you
