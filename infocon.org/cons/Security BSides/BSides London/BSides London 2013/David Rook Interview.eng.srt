1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,390
my talk was called the real ex payments

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,879
application security story and really

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:13,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know where we actually created a</font>

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,010
comic book to tell the story and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

5
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:18,320
the slides themselves were<font color="#CCCCCC"> word the</font>

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,680
comic book<font color="#E5E5E5"> are up on the screen but</font>

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,060
really what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was trying to do was</font>

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,550
explain to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that building an</font>

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,098
application security program is a

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,599
potentially scary thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and in the</font>

11
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:31,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">early days it might feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting nowhere and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of one inspired</font>

13
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,410
me to do the talk was that I saw two

14
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,690
great talks towards the back end of last

15
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,910
year from security people at sea and

16
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,410
Twitter and they showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a great</font>

17
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,260
level of automation in their application

18
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:48,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">security but my initial reaction was</font>

19
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,239
that's great how did you get there what

20
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,410
was the journey you know how did you end

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,870
up at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point because that isn't the</font>

22
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,839
starting point for anyone so what I want

23
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do was tell people look you know</font>

24
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">people look at us and see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font>

25
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,390
application security well now but I

26
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,640
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to explain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to them that that</font>

27
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,439
wasn't always the case so I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,149
the story of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know from when I was</font>

29
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,880
first put in an application security

30
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:12,799
role and we had nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how we built</font>

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that up over six years you know the</font>

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,530
things that worked well the things that

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,820
didn't work well and what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do</font>

34
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:21,170
differently if I could do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all over</font>

35
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:23,449
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> my name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is David rock and I'm the</font>

36
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,969
application security lead at a company

37
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:29,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> relax payments so I work in in</font>

38
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:31,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dublin for relax and over the past six</font>

39
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:33,229
and a half years I've been responsible

40
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,749
for application security in the business

41
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:38,329
so what you'll see in this this this

42
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:40,429
talk today is how I built our

43
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:42,829
application security program from

44
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:45,109
nothing right the way through to where

45
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:47,240
we are today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to</font>

46
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:49,908
give a talk like this is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I saw</font>

47
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,100
some really good application security

48
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:54,319
talks towards the end of last year

49
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,689
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know from Twitter and</font>

50
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:59,569
Etsy and they showed how they had some

51
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:01,520
fantastic automation for application

52
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:04,340
security to make reviews and testing

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,020
really easy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the first</font>

54
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,030
question I asked when I saw those was

55
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,100
you know what I'd be more interested in

56
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,990
is how you got to that point how did

57
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,670
etsy in Twitter develop their

58
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,700
application security over the years<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

59
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,470
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that point</font>

60
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,208
you know we're not quite at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

61
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,680
level as those guys yet but you'll see

62
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:21,780
later in the talk we're getting close to

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,519
it so but what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to tell you in</font>

64
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,290
this talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hopefully you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know give</font>

65
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,239
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people reassurance if you'll build</font>

66
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,910
an application security programs from

67
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,280
day one now that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us start off</font>

68
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,319
with really rubbish application security

69
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,910
programs and when you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> back or I</font>

70
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,349
know when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> look back you kind of a</font>

71
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,599
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit embarrassed about what you</font>

72
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:41,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">used to do in the early days but the</font>

73
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,899
point is you all have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start simple</font>

74
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,209
and i want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you how that can</font>

75
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,549
develop over time I suppose kind of like

76
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're well known same keep calm and</font>

77
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:50,700
carry on you know in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the early days</font>

78
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,380
you're going to worry about a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

79
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,260
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to wonder you know</font>

80
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,269
how is X Y Zed company doing and so on

81
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,640
don't worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things to start</font>

82
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,470
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> and build up slowly yeah things</font>

83
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,910
will go wrong things you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll</font>

84
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,489
look at other companies and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be jealous</font>

85
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,739
and envious of what they have in place

86
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:09,329
but don't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know keep simple keep</font>

87
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,260
calm and just carry on building your

88
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:12,260
program over time

89
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,780
you
