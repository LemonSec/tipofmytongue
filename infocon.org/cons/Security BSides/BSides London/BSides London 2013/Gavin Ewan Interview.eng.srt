7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,199
necessarily got through the community

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,769

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:48,089
attack to come through that medium and

19
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,860

off of your own network which you

52
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,689
probably should do for productivity but

53
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are going to use smartphones so</font>

networks

58
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,500
actually using an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email address as</font>

59
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,930
specifically just for those social

60
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,239
networks particularly avoiding the work

61
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,920
email address but avoiding your personal

62
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,810
email that has all your information and

63
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,750
so that if the social networks popped
