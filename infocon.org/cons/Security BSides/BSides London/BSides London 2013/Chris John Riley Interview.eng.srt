1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,859
but the presentation I did was it's kind

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of an HK situations I like looking at</font>

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of weird and wonderful ways and the</font>

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,518
ways that browsers and other software

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,730
actor interacts with each other and the

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,100
the research centered around how

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,960
browsers deal with certain HTTP response

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,210
and status codes differently you'd think

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,920
that because there's an RFC everything

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,060
responds in exactly the same way it's

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,130
written on a piece of paper that

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,359
everything should do this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,519
everything does it in exactly the same

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,800
way so you get these<font color="#E5E5E5"> these weird</font>

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,719
situations where specific codes are

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,879
handled differently by browsers and i

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,700
was looking specifically on how<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,860
could use those differences to mess up

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,320
scanners and automated attackers and

20
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,430
really start to kind of be more

21
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">offensive about defense without</font>

22
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,050
attacking back because that's a whole

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,910
nother matter but really kind of doing

24
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,199
active defense and saying I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

25
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,360
to sit still<font color="#E5E5E5"> and wait for you to punch</font>

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,608
me I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to budge around and if you</font>

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,649
can still punch me great but quite a lot

28
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people they're gonna miss and if you</font>

29
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,530
keep keep mobile try and be trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

30
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,479
harder to attack and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

31
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,310
invest a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time you can</font>

32
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">really do some wonderful things the too</font>

33
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,310
long didn't read didn't stay for the

34
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,439
whole presentation version of it is

35
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:23,220
described<font color="#E5E5E5"> defensive uses of HTTP status</font>

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,689
codes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's boring status codes who</font>

37
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">the who the hell looks at status codes</font>

38
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:29,610
but still we're gonna we're now<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and</font>

39
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">go through a couple of interesting and</font>

40
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,810
freaky things that you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

41
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,040
status codes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pen testers nightmare</font>

42
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,970
where you go to an admin site you get

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,220
403 it's kind of good access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that but</font>

44
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,350
a majority of the time you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually</font>

45
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,149
bypass it but yeah anyway that's another

46
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,408
talk for another time there's certainly

47
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,520
a practical application for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff</font>

48
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,020
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were right at the beginning of</font>

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,789
research for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of thing and it's</font>

50
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,439
very hard to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can use the</font>

51
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,600
research that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we currently have and say</font>

52
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,210
I can protect myself against automated

53
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,369
scanners<font color="#E5E5E5"> just by doing this in this but</font>

54
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,100
it is it is a good a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good starting point</font>

55
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,810
and

56
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,729
hope that people are going to take on

57
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,040
board what I've talked about really kind

58
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:08,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">of figure it out for themselves how they</font>

59
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,569
can fit it into their environments how

60
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,269
things like wraps things up modsecurity

61
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:14,890
can try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of that</font>

62
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,900
automatically into protections and maybe

63
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,220
in a year or maybe two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we'll</font>

64
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,709
start to see that being something that

65
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,840
is normal amongst waves and that's good

66
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:24,280
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of innovation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

67
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,630
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the end-all and be-all is</font>

68
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,430
certainly not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the silver bullet but</font>

69
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,170
every little bit helps and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more we</font>

70
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">can build into these kind of tools that</font>

71
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">do it without companies dealing to think</font>

72
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,840
about things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and implement things within</font>

73
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,230
an application the better I think it's

74
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be good</font>
