1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:10,370
so my presentation was about trying to

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:13,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">learn what chess players due to analyze</font>

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:17,850
chess games efficiently and how can we

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:20,039
apply that into security analysis for a

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,039
system because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what happens many</font>

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,340
times is we get excited as security

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,260
testers<font color="#CCCCCC"> by it is looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at something</font>

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,539
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be very promising without</font>

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,350
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at having having looked at</font>

10
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,120
the rest of the items and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we spend</font>

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,760
so much time on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find is not</font>

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,530
exploitable and then you had something

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,610
beside it that was exploitable and you

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,430
didn't even look at so the we are not

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,430
using time efficiently and this whole

16
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,440
came from the offensive security

17
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,180
certified professional this for the

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,420
certification there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 24-hour hacking</font>

19
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,010
challenge so my situation in 2008 was

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,680
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had less</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than one year of</font>

21
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,920
experience in security so I was really

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">afraid that well if there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are these many</font>

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,070
security testers who have more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than five</font>

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,970
years of experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they are failing</font>

25
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:14,639
the test I have no chance so what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

26
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,048
to prepare<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that test was to put</font>

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">together set</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up scripts that will</font>

28
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,549
automate a lot of my tasks so that I can

29
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,470
work in parallel and these are the

30
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,540
concepts<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have been applied into my</font>

31
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,220
open source tool which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called all WTF</font>

32
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,280
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> offensive web testing framework</font>

33
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,850
which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Noah's project and he's going</font>

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be in the OS summer google Summer of</font>

35
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,429
Code so students can be paid to work on

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,009
on it during the summer instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

37
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,250
flipping burgers so in this talk what

38
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,110
I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about is pen</font>

39
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,420
testing like a grandmaster trying to use

40
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">the techniques that chess players have</font>

41
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,970
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> using for a very long time to</font>

42
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:56,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">analyze game sufficiently add perform at</font>

43
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:01,140
the highest level so<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially the</font>

44
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,790
idea is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do all their creative work in</font>

45
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,340
the background while<font color="#E5E5E5"> the human is</font>

46
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,890
thinking in parallel<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they have an</font>

47
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,380
interface so that they can flag<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok this</font>

48
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,850
tool output i have already revealed

49
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,350
the output<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not important for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me in</font>

50
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:17,160
the context of the test that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing</font>

51
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,660
but this other tool the output<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really</font>

52
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,150
promising and I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

53
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">good way of attacking the site so what I</font>

54
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,500
discussed<font color="#E5E5E5"> during the talk was that what</font>

55
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,840
chess players do is they analyze into

56
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,420
strips so at the beginning there are a

57
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,370
lot of moves they can make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

58
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,839
legitimate and what they do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

59
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:38,850
discard the less interesting ones so

60
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,100
they take<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of all of those and they</font>

61
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,840
try to focus their<font color="#CCCCCC"> analyses on three or</font>

62
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,950
four moves that look the most promising

63
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,650
and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones that they</font>

64
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,929
analyzed in more depth so what I try to

65
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,540
do with all<font color="#E5E5E5"> WTF is apply the same</font>

66
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,880
concept but for security analysis so

67
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,160
what you have is all the tools around

68
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,290
for you in the background<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you</font>

69
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,299
review the dell put of the tools and you

70
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,040
can flag<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this shallow</font>

71
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,280
analysis first discarding a lot of stuff

72
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,890
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not interesting and then you can</font>

73
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,330
flag what is more important so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you</font>

74
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,040
do this first sweep that you look at

75
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,470
everything but without spending too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

76
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,840
time on it and then you can spend more

77
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">time on the parts that look the most</font>

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,500
promising and this way you can really

79
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:24,570
see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole picture and try to think</font>

80
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,730
not only how to probably get in but also

81
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:29,130
how to change vulnerability is like a

82
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:32,399
real attacker would do and then there

83
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,829
was a little touch on that is just not a

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,020
web application security that if you get

85
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,600
in you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show impact and this all</font>

86
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,430
these pivoting and they were there was

87
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,959
in the last scenario they showed those

88
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,580
all these people think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and started i</font>

89
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,950
think is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important to show to the</font>

90
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,500
customer if this network segmentation or

91
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:52,709
not and how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> damage can you really</font>

92
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,180
make if you get in so that's more or

93
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:56,910
less what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i try to cover in the talk</font>

94
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,680
well one thing is is yeah that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

95
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,390
people tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get carried on is the</font>

96
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,190
same as when somebody starts to<font color="#CCCCCC"> play</font>

97
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,350
chess you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think all these books</font>

98
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,000
looks really promising and then you look

99
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,850
at that but you miss the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other move that</font>

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,860
was better so in security we have some

101
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,680
of that but another big problem is that

102
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,660
people do not typically they do not

103
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">prepare ahead of time and they do not go</font>

104
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,209
properly so what i covered was some

105
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,180
scenarios where you know we utterly TF

106
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,599
it separates<font color="#E5E5E5"> their plugins the</font>

107
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,940
you can run without permission for from

108
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,160
the ones that you need permission for so

109
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,139
there's like passive that don't send<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

110
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,880
traffic against the target semi passive

111
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:37,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">that send traffic but the traffic is</font>

112
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,889
normal looking as if a normal user is

113
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,599
visiting side and then this active that

114
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:43,940
would be like direct vulnerability

115
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,660
problem which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more noisy and you</font>

116
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:50,210
did permission for so what I try to

117
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">explain was that if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a brief</font>

118
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:55,130
look at the pass offense in my passive

119
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,199
stuff then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see well</font>

120
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,759
they asking me to test this site but

121
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,470
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> site is talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this other side</font>

122
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,570
so should that other side be in scope as

123
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,099
well so you you can have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these</font>

124
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,740
questions that you can negotiate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

125
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:09,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">your customer to extend the scope if it</font>

126
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,599
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense and without doing a little</font>

127
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:14,630
bit of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> preparation ahead of time I</font>

128
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:17,449
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> most people are missing out yeah</font>

129
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:22,370
you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use your time as best as you</font>

130
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:25,610
can and you really have to to devote

131
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:28,220
your life to to what you love doing so

132
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,659
if if you don't really love security is

133
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,690
going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

134
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:35,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">successful in it and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just have to</font>

135
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:37,219
put the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in and try to be as</font>

136
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:39,740
efficient as possible being efficient

137
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,750
can only be achieved by building

138
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,490
individual skill so I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

139
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">strength factors during the talk so this</font>

140
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,630
individual skill game preparation and

141
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">then game performance because what's</font>

142
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,560
going to happen during some tests is

143
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,359
that the emotions of the test we are

144
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,009
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go up and down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like there's</font>

145
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,199
this moments of excitement when you get

146
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,759
in and these moments that are really low

147
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,300
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find that oh I have to report</font>

148
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,620
all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm running out of time so</font>

149
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,509
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know having controlling the emotions</font>

150
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,669
and trying to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time as</font>

151
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:09,979
effectively as possible having an

152
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:11,870
interface or something that allows you

153
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:13,460
to say okay this I have already reviewed

154
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,530
and I don't have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at it</font>

155
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,138
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is the same chess players do</font>

156
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,849
they only analyze its combination once

157
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:21,800
because otherwise they're giving the

158
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:23,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">other guy an advantage so that's what I</font>

159
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,930
did so try to do explain all that and

160
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,930
applied

161
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,650
