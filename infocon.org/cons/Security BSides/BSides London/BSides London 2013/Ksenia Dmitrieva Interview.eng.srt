1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,330
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking about the new</font>

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:10,090
technology html5 that came out a couple

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,200
years ago and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of prison there are</font>

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,180
a lot of presentations that talk about

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,100
different vulnerabilities and the new

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,439
technologies so what I was trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,480
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the technologies that</font>

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,980
are part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> html5 talk about the</font>

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,619
vulnerabilities and then talk about how

10
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:26,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">to write code securely how to protect</font>

11
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:28,630
your applications from those things so

12
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:31,060
today I'm going to talk about html5

13
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:34,989
attack and defense so different things

14
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:38,760
that html5 introduced all the cool

15
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:41,260
things that it introduced and all the

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,440
dangers of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new technologies that</font>

17
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:48,849
came with html5 it's a living standard

18
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,709
and it doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a date when it will</font>

19
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,170
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> finished when it will be fixed so</font>

20
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,359
it's always developing and it consists

21
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a lot of technologies some of them</font>

22
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:01,050
were part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> html5 and then they broke</font>

23
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,339
off to become their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> technologies so</font>

24
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,560
sometimes you will hear people saying

25
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:07,360
that you know say cross-origin resource

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,360
sharing is a separate technology it's

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,340
not specifically html5 so yeah but that

28
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,240
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> true it used to be part of</font>

29
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:18,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">html5 and it has all the cool new things</font>

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">that make the web applications more like</font>

31
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:23,200
desktop applications most of the

32
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,810
questions were very technical arguing

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,580
about some of the points and suggesting

34
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,770
some other ways to protect the

35
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,990
applications and I had a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

36
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:34,840
questions just a general questions about

37
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:37,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">like how do you do how do you write</font>

38
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,190
secure code secure code standards for

39
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,830
different languages how do you practice

40
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:44,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that well I mean its web two point oh so</font>

41
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,539
it's new technology everybody's using it

42
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,520
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> allows your websites to be more like</font>

43
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,730
your desktop applications you know very

44
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,800
interactive storing a lot of data so

45
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:56,590
yeah everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> is using it and plus you</font>

46
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,060
know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of in some cases it's a</font>

47
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,550
substitution of flash and Silverlight

48
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,860
technologies so you can do all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the video</font>

49
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,929
and audio<font color="#E5E5E5"> with html5</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> without any plugins</font>

50
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,270
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very popular well if you use</font>

51
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,129
something new if you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> something with</font>

52
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,799
new functionality that gives you a lot

53
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:13,130
of power always think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security</font>

54
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:15,860
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

55
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,600
if it gives you some good things it may

56
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,000
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some vulnerabilities think about</font>

57
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,400
how other people can misuse it an attack

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,630
it always you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know have the scales way</font>

59
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,630
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good things and the bad things</font>

60
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,780
you
