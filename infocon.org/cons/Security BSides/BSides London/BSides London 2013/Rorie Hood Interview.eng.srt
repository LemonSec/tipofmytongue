1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,730
well the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is is that</font>

2
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:11,059
malware and especially in terms of

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,049
malware that uses rootkit technology is

4
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:16,108
effectively<font color="#CCCCCC"> King at the moment it is</font>

5
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,910
undetectable to pretty much all

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,980
antivirus especially if you start

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,859
putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in the kernel or in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font>

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">Android where everything is dependent on</font>

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,939
Java Runtime environment and rather

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,550
establish implementation if you

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,239
manipulate that you know all antivirus

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,010
that is built in using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java then becomes</font>

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,280
affected by that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can you know</font>

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,140
start manipulating what the libraries in

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the classes it depends on you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,420
can start telling it what the files it

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,680
thinks are in the file system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,200
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really those kind of two</font>

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,660
vectors applying into<font color="#CCCCCC"> what is</font>

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,370
effectively the modern computer and you

21
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,139
know mobile phones are outselling

22
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,849
desktops you know by a<font color="#CCCCCC"> substantial</font>

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,620
amount now it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,879
change anytime soon and so this trying

25
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at that and trying to</font>

26
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:07,530
effectively demonstrate as you know and

27
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,920
talk about it and say these are big

28
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,890
problems you know what can really be

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,860
done about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you manipulate that</font>

30
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,770
function we<font color="#E5E5E5"> fell a lot within the</font>

31
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,850
library<font color="#E5E5E5"> you basically control all the</font>

32
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,470
functionality that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it depends on so by</font>

33
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,070
replacing these functions we can

34
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,380
effectively<font color="#CCCCCC"> hide from from the user in</font>

35
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,869
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way but a lot of</font>

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,030
antivirus<font color="#CCCCCC"> were focusing on the standard</font>

37
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:38,310
file system tools rather than the actual

38
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,560
libraries my talk is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on my</font>

39
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,659
dissertation dissertation research and

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:48,360
and as a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's looked at the</font>

41
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">communities shared knowledge of you know</font>

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,570
rootkits and malware in general and

43
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:59,000
looking at how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to evolve import that</font>

44
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:02,850
over and evolve is just a fancy word but

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,140
it turns out that where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one's</font>

46
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,258
really well documented because it's been

47
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,090
around for a while the Android one is

48
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:13,328
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very well documented at all</font>

49
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:15,430
there's only a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that seem</font>

50
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:17,110
to have done this sort of research from

51
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,849
what I've seen and it's trying to pull

52
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,420
all those resources together and you

53
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:24,459
know as the resources become better that

54
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,440
we more widely available and you'll

55
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:28,420
become an even bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem it's</font>

56
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,599
effectively led to the the whole bring

57
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,379
your own device to work thing and and

58
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,238
you know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> soon as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> introduce</font>

59
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:36,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices like that into a corporate</font>

60
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,280
infrastructure you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and so it's a</font>

61
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,159
big angle to to start attacking and I

62
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,870
mean how do you really it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

63
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,420
social issue as much as it's a

64
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,700
technological issue because people want

65
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,790
it and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big bosses they say</font>

66
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,040
well is it really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem and they</font>

67
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,929
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the expertise to make that</font>

68
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,150
judgment so they have to rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

69
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,769
people and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

70
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,829
favoritism answer can come in you know I

71
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:04,840
want my iphone or my own<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android device</font>

72
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:07,239
you know I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get it because</font>

73
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll say you know it's good as safe so</font>

74
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,530
there can be some bias involve but it's

75
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,780
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be looked objectively I want them</font>

76
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:18,690
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want people to realize effectively</font>

77
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:22,930
that if your targeted they've got you

78
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,549
effectively because the whole talk was

79
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,400
really centered around post exploitation

80
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:32,680
you've already<font color="#CCCCCC"> been hacked you know it's</font>

81
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:35,680
quite common but the bigger kind of

82
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,859
angle is ok you got hacked and you're

83
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,329
never really going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

84
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:43,650
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a kernel based rootkit on a</font>

85
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:48,489
LOX device providing it's got a way to

86
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:50,019
inject itself into at the startup that

87
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:51,669
effectively means you know how are you

88
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:53,859
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it runs in the</font>

89
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:56,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">caramel which is effectively even more</font>

90
00:03:53,859 --> 00:04:00,209
superior than root root depends on the

91
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:03,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">colonel and so how do you really tackle</font>

92
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:06,129
that kind of issue when antivirus

93
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,620
doesn't access are you know manipulate

94
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:10,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">colonel in any way</font>

95
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,730
so it's a big issue and there's no real

96
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,730
answer to the Lord

97
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,579
you
