00:00:02,929 --> 00:00:07,199
my presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> mainly addressed the</font>

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,090
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of misconception about targeted</font>

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,010
attacks as a lot of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> media actually</font>

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,620
represented that it's very sophisticated

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,360
attacks and in most cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're not so</font>

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,070
sophisticated but still dangerous

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,340
because they're still successful I'm

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,730
sure you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all aware of depending on</font>

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,430
which newspaper you open or reading any

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">webpage there's tons</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of materials about</font>

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,720
oh yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber wars here and someone was</font>

12
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,750
there there's actually another talk by

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">Steven at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment about cyber war how</font>

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,600
to survive<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and so on so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,180
take a step back and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,090
how sophisticated all those attacks that

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,160
we see how dangerous is life out there

18
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,860
and what are the attack was actually

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,959
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring in awareness</font>

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,339
and show that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually people should</font>

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,129
know what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,800
well just rely on the facts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

23
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,660
overstate and<font color="#CCCCCC"> overhyped stuff so there's</font>

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">no real solution as in product wise you</font>

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">can install and then you're down because</font>

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,020
it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a mentality issue but</font>

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,760
it's raising the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> Venice that yes</font>

28
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,699
there are attacks and they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,830
treated respectfully and seriously but

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,390
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the Hollywood scenario that</font>

31
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,369
someone's just slipping a finger and

32
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">then all your systems are broken into I</font>

33
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,110
basically had four sections of a typical

34
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,540
break-in starting from reconnaissance

35
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,490
face break-in and down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> expiration of</font>

36
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data and for all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those faces</font>

37
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,449
actually highlighted a few examples<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

38
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,119
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before showing</font>

39
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it wasn't so successful in some</font>

40
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,170
cases but<font color="#E5E5E5"> also not so sophisticated in</font>

41
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,360
the other cases yes there were some

42
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,820
successful and sophisticated cases like

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,240
Stuxnet but a lot of the cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

44
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,669
there's hundreds per day<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not so well</font>

45
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,280
let's say smart dumb but nevertheless

46
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,020
successful the advice is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

47
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,720
targeted attacks definitely seriously

48
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,429
look for it in your log files and

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,140
everything and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font>

50
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,880
actually able and capable of detecting

51
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,340
them but even

52
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,408
then thought that don't overstate it and

53
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,360
don't be too nervous or panicking about

54
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,360
it because it's not the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the world</font>

55
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,849
you
