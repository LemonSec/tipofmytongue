1
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:08,189
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> presentation the problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm solving</font>

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,740
is the lack of communication ability

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,750
that the security professional has so it

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,400
was a talk structured around building

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,820
your own personal security brand and

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,550
leveraging it for maximum effectiveness

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:23,039
security is a very important topic I

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,560
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a given given the the</font>

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,359
company we're in it's something that

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,369
people are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> passionate about however</font>

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,750
they fail to articulate it<font color="#E5E5E5"> very well so</font>

12
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,899
what you have is people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:38,040
ill-informed an ill qualified appearing

14
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:41,460
on CNN or BBC or<font color="#CCCCCC"> due to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the</font>

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:45,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">latest sort of disaster sites ibis</font>

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,370
disaster so<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak and it's important</font>

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,289
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong personalities and strong</font>

18
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,059
brands within the security community who

19
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,680
actually know their stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that when</font>

20
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,530
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes wrong they're the people</font>

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,539
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and my talk was about to people</font>

22
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,430
like really elevate yourself so that you

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,989
can be those people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people come to</font>

24
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:08,299
when they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know about security</font>

25
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:08,298
well hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> b-sides thank you</font>

26
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">besides always feels like home it's one</font>

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,470
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first places actually spoke</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

28
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,590
significant audience and coming back

29
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:22,798
here is always feels very nostalgic in

30
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,840
some way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are all great security</font>

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,540
people a lot of the talks out here are

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,690
very technical and the law you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are far</font>

33
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,420
smarter than I will ever be so I've

34
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:36,000
never given a security security talk at

35
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,009
bsides instead I'd like to focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what</font>

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,420
I think I've kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like modern way</font>

37
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,160
through and what I'm more passionate

38
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">about is how we can communicate better</font>

39
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,229
how we can do stuff better and how we

40
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">can be more effective security people I</font>

41
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,830
took one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the example of Jamie Oliver</font>

42
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,979
he wants healthy eating that was his

43
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:55,080
message it's how he delivered it yeah so

44
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,360
he went<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the world he went TV</font>

45
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">shows forget Ted all sorts of things</font>

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that he done he was an innovative way</font>

47
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,280
like buying stuff from a store inviting

48
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,300
his friends ran and cooking for them

49
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,690
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our you eat</font>

50
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:09,568
healthy we can learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> from people like</font>

51
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:12,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">that or the mother Teresa or the you</font>

52
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:14,910
know other people of the same same kind

53
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,910
we take a message<font color="#E5E5E5"> just only take one</font>

54
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,500
message<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example the importance of</font>

55
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:22,890
not plugging in not using an encrypted

56
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,750
USB sticks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your data one thing we</font>

57
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">just say don't do it here the document</font>

58
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,380
don't come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to me again bugging me</font>

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,720
about it yeah how do we actually take

60
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,700
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> message and across different</font>

61
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,310
channels and become<font color="#CCCCCC"> the go-to guy for</font>

62
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,190
had we<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage sensitive data on on</font>

63
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,630
removable media I think there's

64
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,060
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> an opportunity to teach</font>

65
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,100
better communication skills bit softer

66
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,790
skills generally overall to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

67
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:49,620
community I think some people are

68
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,510
actually very good<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this already they</font>

69
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">just don't realize how good they are or</font>

70
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,899
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get enough air time or</font>

71
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,540
they're buried deep seven layers deep

72
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,549
within an organization somewhere and

73
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,048
other people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a bit unwilling</font>

74
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:04,079
they're a bit shy and it's just human

75
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:06,690
nature but you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an important</font>

76
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:08,370
message and when you talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to these sort</font>

77
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,930
of like auntie hackers white hats and

78
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,480
stuff you know what what they're doing

79
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,190
their job<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll break it down to there</font>

80
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,500
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> save banks they're trying to</font>

81
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,940
stop hackers and these organized crimes

82
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,090
and criminal and state-sponsored sort of

83
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,560
cyber espionage

84
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,069
yet the scare to get up in front of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

85
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,930
people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk doesn't make sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

86
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:32,018
so there's a chart that I had about

87
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,610
knowledge versus<font color="#CCCCCC"> fame and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focus all</font>

88
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:36,040
the way on the knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't</font>

89
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,900
work upwards and you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

90
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,670
to go very far up you know i'm not

91
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,190
saying don't have knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

92
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">underpins everything but work on your</font>

93
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,989
brand and get yourself out there whether

94
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be within your organization or you</font>

95
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:52,209
know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> white</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> public at large know what</font>

96
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,099
your message is and then have a great

97
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:56,170
delivery platform to support that

98
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:59,018
message so you can have your blog you

99
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,208
can use videos you can use graphics you
