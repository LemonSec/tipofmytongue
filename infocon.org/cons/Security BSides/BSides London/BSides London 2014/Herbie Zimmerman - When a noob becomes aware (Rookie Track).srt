aware basically what I've learned thus

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,008
far trying to put together a security

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,029
awareness program at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company I work</font>

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,029
free to throw some jokes out there about

13
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,760

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,950
the infosec world now formally we could

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,599
say about two years informally though

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,399
I've always been<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a round</font>

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,020
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> windows system</font>

administrator for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company I work for</font>

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,320

20
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,788
job has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be kind of doing a lot of</font>

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,890
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of jack of all</font>

22
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,289
trades as you could say um but really

23
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,199
one of my big focus areas is around um

24
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,960
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build an awareness program so</font>

25
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,449
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of where my story begins so</font>

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,129
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a year or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago Bruce Schneier</font>

27
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,979
however you pronounce his last name

28
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,320
release they<font color="#E5E5E5"> released the blog post out</font>

29
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">there about what he thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know or</font>

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,189
what he thought around security

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,380
awareness and how he thought it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

32
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,508
waste of time energy money and resource

33
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,670
and it really caused this kind of great

34
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,670
debate on the interwebs you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

35
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,570
pros and cons people talking about

36
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">point-counterpoints this sat in the</font>

37
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,220
other and was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really one of the first</font>

38
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:32,189
times that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like really researched and</font>

39
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,810
dug into awareness and read everything

40
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,939
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I possibly could points</font>

41
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,040
counterpoints everything and I walked

42
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,169
away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> this you know at that point I</font>

43
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,180
walked away thinking you know what I

44
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,430
kind of really think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Bruce had it</font>

45
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,409
wrong because for me at least I think

46
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,079
awareness is just another tool within

47
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,149
the security organizations tool belt but

48
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,939
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flip side it also really made me</font>

49
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:57,180
think how does my company do security

50
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">awareness do we do it well and if we do</font>

51
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,829
it well great<font color="#E5E5E5"> well how do we make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

52
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,350
even better but if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it badly well</font>

53
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:08,098
why do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> suck at this and how do we</font>

54
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it better so had a couple ideas try</font>

55
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:12,540
to get the ball rolling<font color="#E5E5E5"> back in</font>

56
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,990
headquarters nothing ever came of it you

57
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">know other</font>

58
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,890
I Ortiz came up kind of died went away

59
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:21,480
so I moved here and one of the first

60
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,459
conversations I had with my manager at

61
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,230
the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like look I really want to</font>

62
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">get an awareness program out there try</font>

63
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,399
to you know get you guys the security

64
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,049
team involved in project stuff like that

65
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,060
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool this is not a</font>

66
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,010
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could do this so it went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font>

67
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,600
and I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> back a little while later and</font>

68
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,299
I had a list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I referred to as my</font>

69
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,790
punch list and basically this punch list

70
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,770
was my ideas or you know various ideas

71
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,720
of getting an awareness program and

72
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,730
campaigns up and running with any

73
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,340
organization you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of my ideas</font>

74
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,310
were you know how do we get users to

75
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,440
create better passwords so do we get a

76
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">password manager or password vault kind</font>

77
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,690
of tool for them to not only use that

78
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:04,350
work but they could use personally at

79
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:06,240
home<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and we've all been through the</font>

80
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,510
yearly kind of stereotypical death by

81
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,640
PowerPoint videos on security awareness

82
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,709
training and stuff how do we take that

83
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">and turn that on you know flip it around</font>

84
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:18,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">and turn it on its head and push it out</font>

85
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:21,240
to the company um so everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

86
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,190
motivated by it they see it they talk

87
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not just another</font>

88
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">PowerPoint presentation that security</font>

89
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:31,140
team does the other you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other</font>

90
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,340
ideas were around you know the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

91
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,339
of concept with security awareness

92
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,400
program um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we package that up</font>

93
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and move that into the the employees</font>

94
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,350
home life so now we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

95
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,000
educating them at work but now we're

96
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,980
educating family and friends and loved

97
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,560
ones and raising their level of

98
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,269
awareness to arm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course there was</font>

99
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,400
the stereotypical get the security

100
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,950
organization out there shaking hands

101
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,140
kissing babies kind of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

102
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,690
because really what we wanted was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

103
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,059
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> team to be known and well liked</font>

104
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:06,120
and respected within the organization so

105
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,640
when new products new you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know projects</font>

106
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,250
applications came up at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point</font>

107
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,510
security was first a thought and we

108
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,580
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be dragged into those</font>

109
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,370
conversations up front instead of being

110
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,570
bolted on at the very back as the teams

111
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,940
are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get you know the</font>

112
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,400
compliance check mark kind of thing and

113
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,800
of course they come from an organization

114
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,669
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very technical have a lot of</font>

115
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,800
system in minutes

116
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,870
traders have a lot of developers and

117
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,360
we've also embraced this<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps model we</font>

118
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,540
really have fallen into this framework

119
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,450
so how do we energize the base you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

120
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,180
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just the same stereotypical</font>

121
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,680
death by PowerPoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know yes we</font>

122
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,620
realize security as everyone's concerned

123
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,630
but how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get the the technical</font>

124
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,250
people involved talking about security

125
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,500
and potentially helping the security

126
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,410
teams fix security issues around the

127
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,720
organization so I came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this list</font>

128
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,790
I gave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my manager I gave it to my</font>

129
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,650
peers I gave in to some of the guys back

130
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the headquarters and everyone came</font>

131
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,520
back and said this is a really great

132
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,920
list it's a good list you've come<font color="#E5E5E5"> across</font>

133
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,200
you know it's not static it comes across

134
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,270
different points frameworks viewpoints

135
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,400
and whatnot it's great go implement it

136
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,870
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right cool so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I started the</font>

137
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,789
implementation process of some of the

138
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,520
easy stuff the low-hanging fruit and the

139
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">more I thought about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the more I kind</font>

140
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,060
of felt kind of weirded out it was

141
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,610
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like something was broken or</font>

142
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,340
missing and the more I thought about it

143
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,960
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> more I kind of realized yeah it was</font>

144
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,719
kind of broke and something definitely

145
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,719
was missing so I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> back re read the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">blog's pros cons even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read like NIST in</font>

147
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,340
some of the other big publications on

148
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:43,110
how they<font color="#E5E5E5"> started and how they recommend</font>

149
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,049
starting security awareness programs and

150
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,180
stuff like that and the more I thought

151
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,000
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just realized I</font>

152
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,760
wasn't going anywhere fast so I took a

153
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,470
step back and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let me not</font>

154
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,500
approach this from a security awareness

155
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,430
program perspective let me let me

156
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,100
approach this from a different

157
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">perspective another vantage point and</font>

158
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,570
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where these three kind of</font>

159
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,210
came to mind because<font color="#CCCCCC"> really if you think</font>

160
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:11,909
about it no smoking wear your<font color="#CCCCCC"> seatbelt</font>

161
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:14,310
and practice safe sex at a foundational

162
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,500
level it's just another awareness

163
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,300
message it's another awareness campaign

164
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,010
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that really interests</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

165
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,740
about these<font color="#E5E5E5"> three and really a lot of</font>

166
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,780
the other popular you know awareness

167
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,910
messages and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot is the fact that</font>

168
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,559
one they have figured out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the medium</font>

169
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,510
they had they have figured out the

170
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to deliver</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that message</font>

171
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:37,260
whether it was radio film print news you

172
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,150
know sending pamphlets with a guy

173
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,440
dressed up in an outfit to you know

174
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,210
primary school

175
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,000
whatever the case maybe they figured out

176
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,650
how to deliver a<font color="#CCCCCC"> message the other thing</font>

177
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,500
that they really figured out was the

178
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:52,109
fact of how to communicate that message

179
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:54,660
effectively so and not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only effectively</font>

180
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,330
to a small group<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people but to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a wide</font>

181
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,980
audience a huge swath of people that

182
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,099
learn and assimilate data in different

183
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:04,200
ways and then lastly not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> did they</font>

184
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,890
figure out how to deliver the message

185
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,539
and the the actual delivery of that

186
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:13,700
message being you know effective and

187
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:16,410
communication but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the emotional hook so</font>

188
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:19,590
trying to figure out how do you get

189
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:21,150
users or in this case general people to

190
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,919
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the awareness message and</font>

191
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you awareness campaign not at a</font>

192
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,090
head level but more the heart because

193
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,110
we've all seen those ads regardless of

194
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,270
you know if it's thieves through your

195
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,280
other campaigns that are you know make

196
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:35,099
it laughs that are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of funny chuckle</font>

197
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,349
to make you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think too oh my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> god I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

198
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,680
unsee<font color="#CCCCCC"> this there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough bleach in</font>

199
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:42,690
the world to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this out of my head so</font>

200
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,270
you take I took all of this and it went

201
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:47,310
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list and I'm like okay with</font>

202
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:49,770
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because definitely it's</font>

203
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,830
no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> missing something it's missing</font>

204
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:55,109
some things and the more thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

205
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:57,419
this and reread again and started coming

206
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,400
up with new ideas the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> I realize</font>

207
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,460
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put the cart before the horse it</font>

208
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,840
really when I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this conclusion</font>

209
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,239
the more that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about I was like</font>

210
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,039
yes the card is before the horse and I

211
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,220
really had that Homer moment that like

212
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,260
doll kind of moment where it all just

213
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,180
kind of fell into place because<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

214
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,789
longer was I baking a cake that was

215
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,950
missing that one key ingredient i was

216
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,850
baking a cake that was missing several

217
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:25,710
and for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this process</font>

218
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:28,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">really these next couple points are some</font>

219
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:32,848
of my big takeaways as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've gone through</font>

220
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:34,620
this one is risk so it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

221
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,789
Chinaman talking to a Frenchman and

222
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,740
they're both talking to each other and

223
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,479
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> native tongues the end of the day</font>

224
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,460
no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> really understands what the other</font>

225
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,159
ones trying to say and that's what this

226
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,680
list was because I never approach this

227
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,160
in the language of business which is

228
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:53,359
risk second point when this is kind of

229
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,480
three points<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is the fact that</font>

230
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,180
fine my list doesn't talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's</font>

231
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,250
doing this who owns this program never

232
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,510
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it because really if you</font>

233
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,420
look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list it's me doing</font>

234
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:07,670
everything second point is if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

235
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,839
figure out who's doing it well what are

236
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:11,930
we trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change or what are we</font>

237
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:14,240
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix so users and the users</font>

238
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,920
behavior culture risk across the

239
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,810
business don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know never thought about</font>

240
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,360
it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the third Point's pleasantly</font>

241
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:23,180
enough the list actually addressed which

242
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,180
was how do we fix it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> all my ideas and</font>

243
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:29,479
whatnot was actually subconsciously

244
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:32,510
fixing a part of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then really</font>

245
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:36,160
lastly probably if you take anything

246
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:38,660
away from this is management<font color="#E5E5E5"> because rib</font>

247
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,750
assuming really at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day if</font>

248
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:44,329
you don't have management's by n so top

249
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:47,269
down into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the awareness program and</font>

250
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:49,459
awareness campaigns it goes nowhere it

251
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:51,860
falls flat on his face and it dies and

252
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:53,689
rots within<font color="#E5E5E5"> because look we've all been</font>

253
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,329
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the situation or we've had friends in</font>

254
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:59,420
the situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know you have a</font>

255
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:02,390
high<font color="#E5E5E5"> level member of executives or one</font>

256
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:04,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the board members at a convention on</font>

257
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,839
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday night probably drank a little</font>

258
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,510
too much of the bar trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font>

259
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">his you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know VPN or whatnot and he calls</font>

260
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,529
them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help desk and he's like look I</font>

261
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">need in if you don't get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me access then</font>

262
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:18,860
XYZ happens so what that demonstrates<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

263
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,620
the frontline guys is the fact that

264
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,779
upper management hasn't bought into not

265
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">only the program but any of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the messages</font>

266
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:30,050
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> campaigns and it just falls flat</font>

267
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:32,000
on its face you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have management</font>

268
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:34,430
not only bought hook line<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sinker</font>

269
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,310
into the program but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need to be</font>

270
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,939
living examples of the program and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

271
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:43,579
the messages within the program itself

272
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:45,170
so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've learned a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot through</font>

273
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:48,519
this process and I'm still learning a

274
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:50,360
lot don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get me wrong but really for me</font>

275
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">awareness you know the awareness</font>

276
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,350
campaign is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred percent you'll</font>

277
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,790
never achieve a hundred percent the

278
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,290
keynote even talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred</font>

279
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,120
percent and will never be achievable

280
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,790
because really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll have those guys</font>

281
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,770
that continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to smoke regardless you'll</font>

282
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,599
have those idiots that don't wear the

283
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">seatbelts even though they know they</font>

284
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,460
should

285
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,410
and you know that those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

286
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,500
people out there that don't practice

287
