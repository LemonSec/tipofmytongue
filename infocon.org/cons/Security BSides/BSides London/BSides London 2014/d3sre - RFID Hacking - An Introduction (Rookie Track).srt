1
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:12,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so hello</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone I'm talking about</font>

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,870
RFID hacking because I recently started

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:19,740
a semester work at<font color="#E5E5E5"> school and I wanted</font>

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">to break our school license but so when</font>

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,038
I was started with all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put</font>

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,859
together all of the information that

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,590
might have been good to have before I

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,019
started so in case you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to play</font>

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:35,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">around with RFID in the near future this</font>

10
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:37,920
could help you just quick overview the

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,860
first steps<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to show you what you</font>

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,629
need to look after and then the RFID

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,399
technology need to knows because they're

14
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:46,949
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basic things to understand</font>

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,340
the concept then what else is<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible</font>

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,440
afterwards and then I put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together a few</font>

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">RFID readers and what the differences</font>

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,160
are and what might be possible good for

19
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:01,649
you to use and I put<font color="#CCCCCC"> them some nice</font>

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,940
groups and those groups that are put

21
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,790
here together and all of the information

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,350
is actually it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a full list</font>

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,600
of all the possibilities this just the

24
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:14,729
stuff i stumbledupon so but you first

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,089
need to define is what is your step what

26
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:21,150
is your goal cuz if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just want to</font>

27
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,850
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own home rfid system which</font>

28
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,310
many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to do you do you need</font>

29
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,369
different specifics and different

30
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:33,119
features then if you want to for example

31
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,200
read a card that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have and also if</font>

32
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,520
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to learn about the technology</font>

33
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,390
you might want to choose a different

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:43,199
reader then if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to like hack</font>

35
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:46,140
accord also there are many different

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,060
standards available and they have

37
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,310
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> features so for example there</font>

38
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,159
are more complicated ones one Smith with

39
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,750
a more memory to store stuff on but they

40
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,290
also do have different encryptions

41
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:01,439
available on those cards and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

42
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">desk fire cards to my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focus fire ones</font>

43
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,189
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a chip and wolf so it's</font>

44
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually quite happy to break that</font>

45
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:11,940
because it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> have more features</font>

46
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,710
what I'm now focusing on are the ones on

47
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,230
high frequency the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirteenth of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

48
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:20,760
six megahertz once the 1k<font color="#CCCCCC"> my fair and</font>

49
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:24,899
they are also part of that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> so 14</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 443</font>

50
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:28,079
standard and this is this is one column

51
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,150
type of card that is mostly distributed

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,070
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> are it's like the one most used out</font>

53
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,830
there so it's very possible that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

54
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:37,470
go to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> fur card from some vendor that</font>

55
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:42,540
you've got one of those now about this

56
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:46,050
card it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> have 16 sectors each does</font>

57
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:49,290
have four blocks the lost block of each

58
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:52,080
sector has an access key and up to to

59
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,910
access keys per sector are possible and

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,400
they might have different permissions

61
00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:00,060
that's actually by the vendor to be

62
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">decided the first block usually has the</font>

63
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">UID which is uncommon cards fix and you</font>

64
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:11,250
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> change so that's why is write</font>

65
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:13,080
protected and the general 1k cards do

66
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,180
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the crip the one encryption but the</font>

67
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,880
crypto one encryption is broken as you

68
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,790
most probably know from a few lost CCC

69
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,400
talks so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> also find the links and</font>

70
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:27,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything on the Wikipedia page about</font>

71
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,060
how to break it exactly now for the

72
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:33,480
authentication what you need to know is

73
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:36,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that as soon as your car does get into</font>

74
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,670
close proximity of the reader and it

75
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:42,030
wants to authenticate so it sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

76
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:44,010
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> request the card</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> responds with the</font>

77
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">UID that it has it's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like the</font>

78
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,630
default protocol it always does that and

79
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,480
what then the reader does is sent back

80
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:54,299
to you ID card<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the UID information</font>

81
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,640
and the sector p and now the sector key

82
00:03:54,299 --> 00:04:00,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">I try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prove first said you might not</font>

83
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,640
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that because it's I quickly</font>

84
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">started it and measured up and it would</font>

85
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:10,890
have taken about 100,000 years so um you

86
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:13,828
don't want to do that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as soon as you</font>

87
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,298
have to write sector key the card sends

88
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:17,900
back the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that sector</font>

89
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,759
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you specifically asked for</font>

90
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:21,948
and afterwards it's possible to send

91
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,540
further information or Oscar further

92
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:25,699
information or to send for the commons

93
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,380
because for example our dance<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pacific</font>

94
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:30,800
comments to increase for example a

95
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:34,039
number that is stored in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> my fair in</font>

96
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,880
that slot and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will get</font>

97
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:39,440
pressured of replies and stuff so what

98
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,990
you can do as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you have your</font>

99
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,960
stuff set up you first want to do that

100
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:48,380
authentication key and there are default

101
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,810
key is available I put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> website with a</font>

102
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,570
list of default keys in the reference

103
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,550
section this might be helpful in case

104
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,810
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it with y'all like I said</font>

105
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,530
you don't want to try the brute force

106
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">but what you can do is you can eavesdrop</font>

107
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,760
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> communication for that you need</font>

108
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:07,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then 10 on the receiver and not all</font>

109
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,409
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the readers to have that feature and</font>

110
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">well though they can do that but the</font>

111
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,180
emulating part is actually they're very

112
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:17,419
complicated or morph they are the more

113
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:19,669
complicated part so for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might</font>

114
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:21,948
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to have specific</font>

115
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:24,799
hardware at first like a few years ago

116
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:27,349
they had the open<font color="#E5E5E5"> p</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ICC for that I'm</font>

117
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,550
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that in a moment but you most</font>

118
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:33,349
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the proxmark free as soon as</font>

119
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication key you're</font>

120
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:37,849
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read up read their data block</font>

121
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:39,919
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> most probably encrypted but as</font>

122
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:41,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this encryption</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just the</font>

123
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,120
crypto one on the typical ones and this

124
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:48,039
can be broken so<font color="#CCCCCC"> information about is</font>

125
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,039
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also in the reference section</font>

126
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:53,719
so and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you else can do is you can</font>

127
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,300
clone a card now with the cloning card

128
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,599
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the UID is usually fixed on the</font>

129
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,610
general cards you get you need to get

130
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:04,820
special<font color="#E5E5E5"> cards and they're sometimes</font>

131
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,800
called magic cards from<font color="#E5E5E5"> China but you</font>

132
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:11,389
can also find them with the keywords

133
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,820
mifare classic<font color="#CCCCCC"> UID and ebay and then you</font>

134
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:17,030
can get the key for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first sector and</font>

135
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:21,260
then you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> change that uid so that's</font>

136
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:24,049
what you need for actually be able to

137
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:26,389
clone a card and it's also funny because

138
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:29,150
some vendors and they say that you can't

139
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:31,500
clone apart because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this unique car</font>

140
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:34,950
unique IDs<font color="#E5E5E5"> that aren't able</font>

141
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,200
impossible to change well it's I don't

142
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:40,310
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> world they live but they are</font>

143
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:44,159
import from china isn't that difficult

144
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:46,830
now to the readers i started my reader

145
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,260
pro<font color="#CCCCCC"> check with an arduino rfid reader</font>

146
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:53,190
which i found out is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font>

147
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:56,250
complicated one so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had most experience</font>

148
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,410
with that the good thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about arduino</font>

149
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,050
or else<font color="#E5E5E5"> Perry pi shields is that they</font>

150
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:02,640
are combined to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the standards to that</font>

151
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,780
iso standard which you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

152
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,630
because you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the same</font>

153
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:10,200
comments and stuff to make all the all

154
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,760
of the communication but um it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

155
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,890
hard because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to write the</font>

156
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,930
protocol code all yourself it's possible

157
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:18,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">that some people put stuff up on key top</font>

158
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:22,200
but you need to really<font color="#CCCCCC"> work for that and</font>

159
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:24,650
might need some luck and but uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found</font>

160
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:28,140
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm for example the experior</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

161
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:31,669
sold by<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad as well radiata and her aid</font>

162
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:35,610
another shop and she does<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a github</font>

163
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:38,359
web page also<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of code so you</font>

164
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,620
might want to start look there first

165
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,390
some of the readers do have hardware

166
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,210
limitations which is nasty if you only

167
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,409
find that out afterwards because for

168
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,020
example the seats<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your fighting</font>

169
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,700
module if you want to read the data

170
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,640
section it does have a hardware

171
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:56,400
limitations where it only reads 80 bites

172
00:07:53,640 --> 00:08:00,810
and not the 256 that will be available

173
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is yeah a little sad and the</font>

174
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">quality of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> documentation it really</font>

175
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,390
does vary you need to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure first to</font>

176
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:09,210
find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have a good</font>

177
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:11,520
documentation available and how good the

178
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:13,169
whole reader is<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop still so you</font>

179
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,890
don't hang on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wrong places</font>

180
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:19,590
afterwards now the intermediate readers

181
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:23,610
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> called them because they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are a little</font>

182
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:27,299
more expensive but also they have a

183
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:31,320
little more support there and so that

184
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:33,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">ACR</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 120 to you is the one that is used</font>

185
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:37,110
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> backtrack manuals i'm not sure</font>

186
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:39,330
if you saw them but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> card reader has</font>

187
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,950
been proven<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be working and is really</font>

188
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:44,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">working with the drivers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and everything</font>

189
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:46,730
so it's probably easy to set up I

190
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,650
once and sold the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the open PCD</font>

191
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:52,760
reader it's the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is famous from</font>

192
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:54,980
all the CCC talks um well the problem

193
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,670
with that one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> had was that it was only</font>

194
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:01,190
running on 32 bits architectures and I

195
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,750
think they now build up all the new

196
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,810
version so they're now in version 2

197
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,310
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to emulate tax the</font>

198
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,609
first version wasn't able to do that if

199
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:12,829
i remember right and they now have like

200
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,390
trainings available that they make at

201
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,890
different conferences and they also have

202
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,650
a life system that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just boot</font>

203
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:23,150
into which makes the whole driver part

204
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:25,730
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to get started and it's not</font>

205
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:28,400
that that much more expensive than the

206
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:32,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">Arduino ones so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably good to</font>

207
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,350
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at and just the prices are</font>

208
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones from the country that the</font>

209
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,930
reader is are originally from so that's

210
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:41,060
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kept them like this now the</font>

211
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,489
proxmark free is the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I called</font>

212
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,410
the deluxe version because it doesn't

213
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,020
only have the biggest are the most

214
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:50,529
features it does have a big active

215
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,000
community it supports different

216
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:55,160
frequencies<font color="#CCCCCC"> like high-end low frequency</font>

217
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,830
depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 I you use you can or</font>

218
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:01,370
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> done separately it also supports</font>

219
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:03,500
emulating cloning and eavesdropping and

220
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,910
it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a really nice forum where</font>

221
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,529
you can discuss with<font color="#CCCCCC"> other people what</font>

222
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,270
the experiences they had and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

223
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:11,600
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> with setting anything up they can</font>

224
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:14,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically help you but um it's also the</font>

225
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,000
most expensive one so you might get

226
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,360
bundles at different stores butter this

227
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,740
is the one you're gonna pay most for

228
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,089
although this price now is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

229
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:26,270
enclosed version if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have the</font>

230
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:28,850
one without the body around it's a quite

231
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:31,490
a bit cheaper than so<font color="#CCCCCC"> many one have a</font>

232
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:34,490
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and it really gives you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

233
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:40,130
most options so that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good reason to</font>

234
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:42,920
stick for that one no so and here are

235
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">the references I put those papers all</font>

236
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,939
together because they were helpful to me

237
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,729
they were explaining a lot of the basics

238
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,030
and stuff behind to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to crack</font>

239
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,510
stuff

240
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:57,839
and you might just want to go through

241
00:10:54,510 --> 00:11:00,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in case you're interested so I'm</font>

242
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">already done do you have any questions</font>

243
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,690
yes did you do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like just using a</font>

244
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,750
ten-dollar<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDR</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> USB sticks if you can use</font>

245
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:12,360
drop on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> petty communications no no</font>

246
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,610
I actually just had my own or doing a

247
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">setup at home</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the student license</font>

248
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:20,340
and everything and I tried playing

249
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:23,400
around with that mostly and I didn't get

250
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:25,620
to the whole public readers yet because

251
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,020
I'm officially not allowed to do that so

252
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:31,590
I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to shift my focus off</font>

253
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:36,180
the talk or of the and the study that I

254
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:40,970
do two wards an<font color="#CCCCCC"> rfid game because there</font>

255
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:43,770
might be easier with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nda's and yeah</font>

256
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:46,200
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeahs practical is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

257
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:48,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">eavesdropping what sort of key for that</font>

258
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,480
well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> East dropping the biggest</font>

259
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,770
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably the antenna and how</font>

260
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,290
far you can reach and there are

261
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:58,050
different antennas also privately built

262
00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:01,199
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to support longer length</font>

263
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:06,109
than the ones officially allowed and but

264
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:08,640
that's probably up to your imagination

265
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:11,010
and there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been many talks that have</font>

266
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,780
proven that it's possible to read study

267
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:17,680
information over more or bigger

268
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:19,689
distances yes if there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> one kind of</font>

269
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,479
you would suggest for somebody's looking

270
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:25,600
to get into RFID which of the

271
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:28,480
suggestions with you well if you want to

272
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:32,470
learn about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocol then I would go</font>

273
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the Arduino stole and ate xbone</font>

274
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:37,330
actually because it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> have really</font>

275
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:41,860
nice documentation and with nice scripts

276
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:45,610
ready to use and also like a nice forum

277
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:47,230
as well with father and but if you want

278
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,820
to have it easy and just get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Chop</font>

279
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:54,730
done then I will go<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the proxmark</font>

280
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:57,430
free yes silly guarantee yes in terms of

281
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:01,649
bucks each because has been making<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">talk who knows the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very soon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do well</font>

283

those in the UK we I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

284
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:11,589
the UK loss I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> from here but I mean</font>

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,969
I've gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this whole thing from</font>

286
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:15,570
the technology point of view because I

287
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:18,670
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand how it works</font>

288
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:21,910
legally there are issues cuz most

289
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:25,120
vendors if they give out a card they

290
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,740
expect you to behave well and so you

291
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,870
always need to make sure before you

292
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,790
started an investigation or something or

293
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:33,730
before you want to learn more about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

294
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:37,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if it's all right with that vendor</font>

295
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:40,959
but I'm it's hard because it's so easy

296
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,270
exposed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know how</font>

297
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,880
they try to or how why they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

298
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,900
protect it and how they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that</font>

299
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,900
in short

300
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,490
from the car you actually coming in ID

301
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,979
connected you actually is that the whole

302
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:58,470
time going to get the car loans<font color="#CCCCCC"> God and</font>

303
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,930
to prove you can get the pin ID so can

304
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:04,230
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a certificate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on it well you can do</font>

305
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:06,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">that also I've heard that some vendors</font>

306
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,280
actually should chest to the people

307
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,080
they're selling their products you that

308
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,130
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to improve the software</font>

309
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is running</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the back and doing</font>

310
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:16,380
the checks so if in for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example those</font>

311
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:19,650
cards are used as student licenses as

312
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:24,180
public transport thingies and I don't

313
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:25,970
know but I'm if you use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

314
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,790
paying for your food at a container

315
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:31,620
which is a common thing then they

316
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:34,980
suggest that the software in the back

317
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:37,890
the dose do the credit transactions<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

318
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,440
checks for it it's checks if you always

319
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:42,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">have like the same amount of money on</font>

320
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,520
the card and if some person always shows

321
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,680
up with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same amount of money then</font>

322
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,939
there might be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

323
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,890
way they try to handle it which is

324
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:55,560
horrible but that's just my personal

325
00:14:52,890 --> 00:15:01,230
