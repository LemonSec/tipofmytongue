7
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:18,600
so I'll start with a brief summary what

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,460
we're covering today so why passport

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,620
theft is so dangerous because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,540
some people forget other replications

other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> already got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> passport stolen</font>

12
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,340
how passwords are currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> being stored</font>

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:38,519
the good<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plaintext ship</font>

it you can buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a beer later and how</font>

00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:42,059

18
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,550
all a quick summary of everything

19
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,129
discussed and they'll take some some

20
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,480
questions so why is passport<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifth so</font>

21
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,339
dangerous<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's a pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious</font>

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:58,739
answer because someone has your password

23
00:00:55,339 --> 00:01:00,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">so speaks for itself but the less</font>

24
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,349
obvious answer that the shroom will

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,640
hopefully not resonate with is because

26
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,630
then someone has your password for

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything paypal did a survey two years</font>

28
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,969
ago 60-plus percent of users use the

29
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,039
same password across multiple websites

30
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:18,538
so it doesn't matter if Facebook stores

31
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:20,310
your password securely if it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that has a password breach they now have</font>

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">your Facebook password and directly</font>

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,829
there was a three hundred percent

36
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,899
increase in a single quarter and

37
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,270
password theft I think everyone will

38

why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> bother stealing passwords because</font>

45
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,850
you only need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to steal passwords if you</font>

with that sort of stuff here<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do kind</font>

don't store passwords and plain text

use or so all it takes is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 minute</font>

77
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,750
trade-off people can regenerate all the

78
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,510
rainbow tables so salting doesn't stop a

79
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,770
targeted attack and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your gaming guys</font>

who absolutely love your new graphics

81
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,010
cards that's great for hackers as well

82
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:22,130
because password cracking is getting

83
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,540
faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't even need to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a GPU</font>

84
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,820
in front of you you can rent for about

two bucks and ever and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon Cloud</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

instance with a GPU and cracker it that

87
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,660
keyless number of passwords so making

88
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:34,160
the hashing more complex and

89
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,420
resource-intensive is only part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

90
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,880
solution to stopping password safe

91
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,200
because when someone's got the dump if

92
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,519
they've determined to use it they will

93
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,910
we can do is target attacks they can

94
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,170
spend lots of time on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but how do you</font>

95
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if your password has ever been</font>

96
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,488
stolen so if you're a company you might

97
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,950
have IPS you may have ideas you make it

98
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:53,450
take some anomalies but how would you

99
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if passwords have been stalling</font>

100
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:59,959
used and the chances are you probably

101
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,700
want some sneaky sis admins may put some

102
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,100
fake system accounts in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Active</font>

they've been compromised because user

Rory doesn't actually work that it's a

110
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,019
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user account and see if it's</font>

00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:23,090
actually used you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see how often it's</font>

112
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,470
used they can see is permissions because

113
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,810
if you create a honeypot cone this

114
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,770
actually got access to your ad then

115
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,229
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> being stupid</font>

116
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,758
so hackers if they get access to this

117
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:35,330
account needle to profile<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and tell</font>

you fsellege account or not sopheak user

119
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,878
accounts aren't quite to fill proof but

120
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">we like the idea of making a high risk</font>

121
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,310
getting game for the attacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has</font>

122
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:49,310
your data so what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had fake</font>

123
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,509
passports so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where the concept</font>

124
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,030
of honey words come in it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

125
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:57,139
discussed in a paper by two guys jewels

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> resist over at MIT last me and the</font>

127
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:03,199
basic theory is after every user account

128
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,080
there are multiple passwords with all

129
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,810
one legitimate passport can we detect

130
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,859
passport left by watching for the use of

131
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:15,380
known fake passwords in the database so

132
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,630
a traditional unsalted md5 may look

133
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,150
something like this so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll Gavin's</font>

141
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:40,520

142
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:42,860
so how would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you even go about making</font>

143
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,198
fake passports they have to be

144
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,000
believable<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you've got 100 entries</font>

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to name them a really secure</font>

146
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,710
passwords and one of them's password the

147
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,330
real password stands out equally if the

148
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,900
user<font color="#CCCCCC"> have got a really strong password</font>

149
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,979
and you've got cat dog<font color="#CCCCCC"> mouth sheep or if</font>

150
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,840
they're all the same case they'll be

151
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,370
taken by animals the fake passwords

152
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,869
become particularly obvious so how do

153
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,909
they make honey works they have to be

154
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">believable there has to be some</font>

155
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:08,479
low-hanging fruit because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have to</font>

156
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,370
be crackable in order for the heck<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

157
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,810
have to use them there has to be some

158
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,909
tough passports to leave the attacker

159
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:17,300
guessing if they've actually cracked the

160
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:18,680
right passwords are not as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovered</font>

161
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,610
when I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> rating a technical demo for</font>

162
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,960
this you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that you</font>

163
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,960
don't accidentally generate a honey

164
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,068
water for the user actual password

165
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,690
that's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't there in to be fixed</font>

166
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:31,610
up and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

167
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,430
identify fake passwords because if you

168
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">can then then you can really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use them so</font>

169
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,300
i started to dictionary select the

170
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,609
handful of what is a varying lengths and

171
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,240
in order to decide how hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted to</font>

172
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,979
meet the password

173
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,380
crack<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mangled it up in lowercase</font>

174
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:47,080
letters some things pre-painted numbers

175
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,789
and symbols painted numbers and symbols

176
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,500
substituted symbol then so threes and

177
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:54,169
fives and aces and things then

178
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,300
concatenate<font color="#CCCCCC"> what is together and again</font>

179
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:59,448
making sure we don't accidentally use

180
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,520
our user password so then we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

181
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:04,009
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a correct check some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your users</font>

182
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,690
password and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create some fake</font>

183
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:07,940
check sums for all the honey ones will

184
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:11,419
generate it so a database now looks

185
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,310
something like this so user Gavin Rudy

186
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:15,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tiago and in a separate password stable</font>

187
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:19,819
you've got your password hashes in your

188
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:22,068
checksums so our new method of attack

189
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:24,500
would-be attacker gets hold of a

190
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:26,990
database files up John gets the plain

191
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,599
text back but another example here the

192
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:33,710
vulgar one in five twenty percent chance

193
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:36,110
of getting the right password one in

194
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,460
five still quite a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big chance after your</font>

197
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:44,750
up just by adding more honey words so

198
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:47,870
what would the workflow look like for

199
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,880
authenticating<font color="#E5E5E5"> against that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you would</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">start with your web server take the</font>

202
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:55,909
database server the database error

203
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:57,800
retrieves the checksum where the user ID

204
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:59,630
and hash match and pass it to the

205
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,180
authentication server so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

206
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:05,210
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hash match on that user ID then</font>

207
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,830
it's just simply a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong password the</font>

208
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,719
users must type something like that it's

209
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:11,289
a wrong password it's not a threat if

210
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:13,990
they do get hurt it takes the checksum

211
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:16,039
passes it's an authentication server

212
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,110
notification server does is it performs

213
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:20,419
an additional check the same check used

214
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,400
to generate the checksum on the hash

215
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:24,650
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was sent and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what this does is</font>

216
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">compares the hash it was saying the</font>

generated to ensure that password that

219
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,659
you've taped in is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we took</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">jane everything all the honey words and</font>

222
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:38,000
that return true or false to the web

223
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:41,179
server so the web server gets back true

224
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,390
great real users organ they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> log in</font>

225
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:46,160
if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets back false at this stage we</font>

226
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,680
know that yes the password exists in the

227
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,719
database but no it's not our users

228
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,630
password therefore we know there are

229
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,830
password database has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been stone so in</font>

order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred percent</font>

231
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,450
ft the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacker would have to get into</font>

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">all three of these boxes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

get a checksum to see which passwords

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,970
correct so now we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know where so</font>

236
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,540
nobody know rather when I password<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only take password theft easy is</font>

239
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,950
that so I'm afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> I won this thought</font>

240
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,150
this was going to be really technical

241
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,820
and clever it's literally<font color="#CCCCCC"> just more</font>

242
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:26,209
passports and so what else<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we do</font>

243
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:29,120
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do some clever things so</font>

244
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:31,700
what if we regenerated the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fake password</font>

245
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,870
to periodically could we use that the

246
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:38,390
Chairman way in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> password database</font>

247
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:40,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">Pistone internally also companies have</font>

00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:43,760
different login systems may not all use

249
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:45,290
single sign-on so what if you could use

250
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,090
this to determine may need a password

251

breach and forth users to get the

if somebody has I'm actually sort of

353
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:55,230
important so it's somehow the mechanism

354
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:57,239
to generate wrong password should take

355

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to look at the</font>

is lunch it just after ten past one
