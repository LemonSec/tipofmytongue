00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay hello everyone I'm in Georgia</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> boyko</font>

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,610
also known as panda sauce and today I'm

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,169
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about privacy first of all</font>

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:15,450
who's interested in tracking you on the

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,359
Internet I sold it to find out in the

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">last year tracking you is a huge deal</font>

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,090
for the government's but the

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">government's are not the only ones</font>

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,259
tracking you private companies also do

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,948
it and who does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> better as a good</font>

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,109
question so in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of governments</font>

12
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,910
tracking you is mostly expenses because

13
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,130
leah has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be intercepted store</font>

14
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,010
somewhere analyzed and that's quite

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,450
pricey if its private companies they

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,129
actually generate revenue from<font color="#CCCCCC"> your data</font>

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,420
and they get it directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> from youth</font>

18
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:47,820
you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than happy to provide</font>

19
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:50,969
them with it yeah so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we track you</font>

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,059
exactly if we employ mass there is only

21
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:57,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">7</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> billion people on this planet and</font>

22
00:00:53,059 --> 00:01:00,180
that's to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the power of 33 to get enough</font>

23
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:03,300
unique identifier is to identify every

24
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,610
living person so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this useful well</font>

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,280
we can use the reduction of entropy

26
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:11,039
equation which is minus logarithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> base 2</font>

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,740
of the probability that some fact would

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,930
be true for a random<font color="#E5E5E5"> person for example</font>

29
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:22,199
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> say I know your birthday wishes</font>

30
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:25,890
April 29 2014 that's there's 365 days in

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,080
a year so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's one 365th and different</font>

32
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,579
that into the calculator<font color="#CCCCCC"> will find out</font>

33
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,890
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have eight and a half bits of</font>

34
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:35,758
entropy already so how do you find<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

35
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:39,630
more cookies cookies are like club cards

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,479
they allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay they allow to</font>

37
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:47,039
use seemingly random data and tie it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

38
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,920
a person or in this case your browser so

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,780
how do please work well imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,930
spring now and in the morning you're

41
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,250
reading<font color="#CCCCCC"> an article about gardening and</font>

42
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,590
while you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> reading the article some</font>

43
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,860
news network some as network is serving

44
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,689
you ads and if you've ever had to serve

45
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,189
as from an as network you know that it's

46
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,500
usually a piece of JavaScript you put in

47
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,869
the page phones back home retrieves the

48
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,420
ads shows them to you but<font color="#CCCCCC"> what actually</font>

49
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,030
happens here is to important<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are</font>

50
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,489
sent to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,760
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network that's that holder of a</font>

52
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:21,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">cookie 1337 that's one is interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

53
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,519
gardening that's too bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> network knows</font>

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,810
it now<font color="#CCCCCC"> Plus forward a few hours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and over</font>

55
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,569
lunch you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different article</font>

56
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,370
and this time the same ads network is

57
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:31,600
serving you as again it's already knows

58
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,150
you're probably interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> gardening</font>

59
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,739
so the ads this time are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

60
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:40,209
about gardening tools hey you might say

61
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,880
so what because there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just some random</font>

62
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:44,200
number it's tied to me and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

63
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,019
have wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy the gardening tools</font>

64
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,359
but scary part is Google is the biggest

65
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:51,670
as provider and a search engine this

66
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,440
also shows social network now so how

67
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,170
difficult would it be to tie a data to

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">your social network profile probably not</font>

69
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:01,899
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult google also owns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube</font>

70
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:08,670
now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube keeps asking you to use</font>

71
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:08,670
your full name<font color="#E5E5E5"> nutr think so Hank home</font>

72
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,819
then go this there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no need to wiretap</font>

73
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:18,370
you it was all done or less legally it

74
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:20,980
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> generates revenue and even</font>

75
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,329
though there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the EU</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cookie law so</font>

76
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,220
what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user do when he sees</font>

77
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:26,500
another nag screen saying that some evil

78
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:31,450
corporation has enslaved him nothing

79
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:33,640
clicks okay even with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

80
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">Flash cookies and there's html5 local</font>

81
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,540
storage which isn't very trivial to

82
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,859
disable you have to go to about config

83
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:43,900
and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> trigger it doesn't end at</font>

84
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:46,329
cookies because your browser is a gold

85
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,100
mine with every HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> request you're</font>

sending<font color="#CCCCCC"> your browser information</font>

87
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,510
operating<font color="#CCCCCC"> system information and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

88
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,090
retrieve a lot of stuff with<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript</font>

89
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,040
I can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what plugins you have</font>

90
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,260
installed what phones are installed on

91
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,720
your system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there is a nice jazz</font>

92
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:06,480
photo which allows me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find your local</font>

93
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,480
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> IP the one behind that works</font>

94
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,310
so how do you think all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> services</font>

95
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,260
generate revenue the generate revenue by

96
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:18,910
selling your data you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the product</font>

97
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:21,899
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> they generate revenue when</font>

98
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:26,650
was the last time you click this button

99
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:27,789
yeah probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the Hong ago but why</font>

100
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,190
did you click it because you like

101
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,600
something but<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you don't have to</font>

102
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,669
click it if you liked something because

103
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,350
you click it<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minutes later you forget</font>

104
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:37,630
that you've collected but facebook now

105
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,330
knows a piece of important data about

106
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:43,900
you and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be stored forever</font>

107
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:45,789
so think about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next time the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

108
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,650
big thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there it has been found out</font>

109
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,419
that the way you move your mouse around

110
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,039
the screen and click things it

111
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:53,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">correlates with your eye movement with</font>

112
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,020
where your attention is and companies

113
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,630
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> already catching up with it they can</font>

114
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,639
generate heat maps like this to see what

115
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:04,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">you were interested in what your where</font>

116
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,400
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end there the</font>

117
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">sharing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top of the cake is they want to</font>

118
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,039
be aware of who clicked it why he

119
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">collected where he came from and where</font>

120
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:18,400
he went afterwards and here you could

121
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:22,380
adjust some sliders and click<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

122
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:27,270
dots and find out more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the users</font>

123
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,270
rational over five years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> yep</font>

124
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:33,729
okay let's move away from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> private</font>

125
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:34,929
companies and go into something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

126
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:37,179
government's<font color="#E5E5E5"> would probably do more</font>

127
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:39,789
techie stuff so what can I find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

128
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:41,498
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting into your browser probably</font>

129
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:43,509
your IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address and a mac address and</font>

130
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:45,759
either is enough to come to your ISP

131
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:48,189
give them a subpoena and find out where

132
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,409
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not the end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

133
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:53,169
because there are open geolocation

134
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:56,979
database is available and you can just

135
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:59,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">go wardriving and find out where certain</font>

136
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:01,089
access points are you can track you

137
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:02,498
there have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever encountered spyware</font>

138
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:05,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">if option</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes with free software</font>

139
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:09,519
bundle it and opted in by default it can

140
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:10,929
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> tricky to remove entirely and it</font>

141
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,519
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get picked up babies because</font>

142
00:06:10,929 --> 00:06:13,899

00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:21,069
collecting some data not detection in

145
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:22,599
some cases it's possible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out</font>

146
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:25,869
whether you're behind an ad<font color="#E5E5E5"> just by</font>

147
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,188
looking at the TTL on the packet and it

148
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:28,629
also tells me what operating system

149
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:31,499
you're using because linux and windows

150
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:34,809
they have different default ETL values

151

mobile devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your mobile things get</font>

00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:40,029
even easier you probably remember this

153
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:42,669
it was from iphone geolocation log

154
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:44,199
scandal and as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I don't</font>

155
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:47,849
understand why someone would want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:22,299
there and come in at any time I like

170

how to reconstruct files that first

178
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,950
over the network and presents them to

179
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:45,520
you in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice way it's not the only one</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">just drag images and other tools are</font>

184
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:58,310
available as well so what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to do</font>

185
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,950
now just need to set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> an evil twin</font>

190
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,890
there's reliable end-to-end encryption

191
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,880
but it wouldn't be the panacea as

192
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:18,650
heartbleed has reminded us recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

some pages will not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be rendered properly</font>

there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not much choice but when you're</font>

that the users they will not be using

something overly complicated they will

they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will always pick the path of least</font>

248
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,940
looking at how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using tor</font>

I<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pee or no measures at all you can</font>

250
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,180
always set up a dark net or a mesh net

251
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:34,370
but that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very limited just to</font>

252
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:38,150
your local peers so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work</font>

253
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:39,710
well but let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the real world</font>

254
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,600
and what you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> about browser</font>

255
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:44,120
tracking there's of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course no script</font>

256
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,400
which is really good it black lists

257
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,050
everything in operates on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> whitelist</font>

258
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,240
basis so you have to explicitly allow

259
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:52,160
every website where you want to enable

260
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">javascript and this really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good because</font>

261
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">it also disables access to html5 local</font>

262
00:10:54,650 --> 00:11:02,180
storage among other things there's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

263
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:05,390
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a slightly different works in</font>

264
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:07,069
slightly different way here it operates

265
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,150
on a blacklist so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a list of</font>

266
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,040
known tractor so instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> walking</font>

267
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:13,750
everything the filters only known

268
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:17,870
trackers it also filters<font color="#CCCCCC"> gyuki trackers</font>

269
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:20,180
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has some features that no script</font>

270
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,550
doesn't have and adblock plus is great

271
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,000
because it has a really flexible system

272
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,699
of rules and exceptions for blocking or

273
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,380
allowing something and it's real good

274
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:33,260
now what's our what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> our future</font>

275
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,760
perspectives here well things do not

276
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,040
seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting any better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

most people understand whatever they're

321
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:37,189
great in that situation in this

322
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,470
situation in vapor case that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> write a law saying right this</font>

326
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:45,799

this would go under arrest improvement

333
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:09,010
