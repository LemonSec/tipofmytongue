so thanks very much everyone yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:10,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">title kind of explains it i'm quite big</font>

advocate on defensive research and why

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,799
doesn't necessarily get the same level

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">of respect in our industries it maybe</font>

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:18,320
should and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go into why i do</font>

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,790
of this is egg-sucking obligatory advert

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,000
where massive were also am always

10
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,590
looking for people so firstly offensive

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">versus defense you know that's I guess</font>

12
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,299
what we're looking at here so we have

13
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,920
two sides of research<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those that</font>

14
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,140
kind of break systems and then those

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,989
that defend and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was fortunate enough</font>

16
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,210
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> early on in my career to be</font>

17
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:43,099
encouraged<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do both so I worked for a</font>

18
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,570
team that did offensive research but

19
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,300
then we did the<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense of research to</font>

20
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:50,120
counteract that and then basically

21
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">turner's into marketable products so</font>

22
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,800
that's the kind of driver if we look at

23
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,960
kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ease of both sides of that</font>

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,530
equation in actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact offensive</font>

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,510
research is relatively easy you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

26
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,449
market which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> driven to make products</font>

27
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:07,429
which is constrained by time money

28
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:09,499
knowledge around security<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need to</font>

00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:12,170
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the products usable there's a</font>

30
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:13,880
metric ton of applications frameworks

31
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,369
that people can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> of which no one is</font>

32
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,469
an expert in you have as we saw with

33
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:22,069
openssl kind of certain mala cultures

34
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:23,990
emerging around certain technologies we

35
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:25,340
have ridiculously short life cycles now

36
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,539
on certain technologies and all of these

37
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:31,369
basically stop us being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

38
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:32,810
secure products and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why you</font>

39
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:34,819
know you only have to find one or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

40
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,149
handful of bugs to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

41
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:40,429
basically destroy the security of it so

42
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:42,619
it's relatively<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy and I I would argue</font>

43
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:44,929
that offensive research while it's

44
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:47,179
getting more complex and especially with

45
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:50,329
the more modern mitigations it's not

46
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:53,359
impossible by any stretch on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

47
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:56,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">hand you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we have defensive research</font>

48
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,639
and so why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do it so really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

49
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:59,238
motivation<font color="#E5E5E5"> for defensive research</font>

50
00:01:57,639 --> 00:02:01,818
unfortunate it's not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

51
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:03,259
famous like offensive will but we're

52
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:05,689
trying to drive down kind of the costs

53
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:07,639
of security generally so we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:09,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep the pit bad people out if that</font>

59
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,600
debt stuff but that's kind of why we're

60
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,460
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do if we're trying to improve</font>

61
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,780
our general awareness of the initial

62
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,770
robustness of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> product but then</font>

63
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,990
awareness of when those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things fail so</font>

64
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,540
what we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> all we have seen</font>

65
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,760
historically is it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very hard outside</font>

66
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">of academia</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do lots of</font>

forward-looking research in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,000
real blue sky stuff because this is no

69
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,489
appetite for it so in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fact what</font>

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,350
we end up doing is something becomes a

71
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,180
problem and we do the research to

72
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,250
counteract that and we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with</font>

73
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,320
spam we've seen it and as you'll see I

74
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,100
go through some concrete examples we're

75
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:55,290
always very reactive and it is kind of

76
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,630
extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> annoying in actual fact if we</font>

77
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,890
look at for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example one of the classes</font>

78
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,290
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about memory</font>

79
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,670
corruption if we'd honestly sat down and

80
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,709
said okay we understand what stack

81
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,109
overflows are we could have probably

82
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,970
predicted heap overflows and then we

83
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,890
could you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> predicted a lot of the</font>

84
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,270
subsequent classes of issue but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

85
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,040
didn't take the opportunity when we

86
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,570
start feeling on the pain to do that in

87
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,890
actual fact what it takes us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do is</font>

88
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,329
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get punched in the face and</font>

89
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,890
so we kind of we learn how to kind of

90
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,120
block our head then it punched in the

91
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,859
stomach and so we learn how to body

92
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,540
block and it's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of continual</font>

93
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,370
war of pain that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we end up going through</font>

94
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,929
because we need to be feeling this in

95
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:32,400
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of justify the research</font>

96
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,990
which is massively frustrating for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

97
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,880
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that are looking to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do defensive</font>

98
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,500
research there are a variety of

99
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">different vehicles and a variety of</font>

100
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,300
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas of which you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do in</font>

101
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,549
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through all of</font>

102
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">those you can all read but if you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

103
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,850
hardcore technologists and you love

104
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,130
hardware so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been fortunate enough</font>

105
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,799
to work at kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of silicon level</font>

106
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,470
designing instruction sets for<font color="#E5E5E5"> new CPUs</font>

107
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,790
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome it's very fascinating but</font>

108
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're not into that and you're and</font>

109
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,170
more into human sciences you know

110
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,149
there's a vast<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially around fishing</font>

111
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,799
for example while speaking to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our some</font>

112
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,680
of our team that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> here doing fishing</font>

113
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,420
and you know they understand that

114
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,760
basically humans want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get stuff done</font>

115
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,220
and going to they know how to solicit

116
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,108
kind of kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information out of</font>

117
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,579
people as a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so there has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

118
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:19,919
be more study around defensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> Human</font>

00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sciences as a result through to all of</font>

00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,700
the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different elements of</font>

121
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,169
system design so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of this is</font>

122
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,640
really if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do defensive</font>

123
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,740
research don't feel that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to be</font>

124
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,539
the best code

125
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,470
that you have to be the best you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

126
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:32,270
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work with a product</font>

127
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,120
manufacturers is such a broad industry

128
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:37,789
or area that we can benefit in many

129
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,380
areas this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of highlights the point</font>

130
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:40,370
which I mentioned it is basically and

131
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,469
what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through now a</font>

132
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,160
number of concrete examples of where we

133
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:48,860
simply haven't learnt significantly so

134
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,930
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> XSS an example cross-site</font>

135
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,949
scripting so we found out originally

136
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,220
there was you know cross-site scripting

137
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:57,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay oh my god so we then start trying</font>

138
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">to defend against it and then Dom XSS is</font>

139
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,568
found when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> start kind of looking</font>

140
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:04,819
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of less than script more than</font>

141
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:07,039
script etc inputs people then found Dom

browser-based XSS protection feature

146
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,139
which was so effective that it managed

147
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,569
to turn some previously non exploitable

148
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:22,909

which<font color="#CCCCCC"> we haven't fundamentally solved</font>

which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a game of source which</font>

is user input versus sync with something

167
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,240

iterative game of aggressive<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus</font>

defender sequel injection that similarly

170
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,590
so we had you know sequin jection was

171
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,819
found so what we're going to do what

172
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,068
we're going to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do first is</font>

173
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:18,139
blacklisting so we're kind of only<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

174
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:20,539
of flag like ticks and simpler stuff

175
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:22,009
which didn't work so what we're going to

176
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:23,599
do there is not fix the issue we're

177
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:25,400
going to hide its presence by giving non

178
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:26,690
verbose error messaging so then the

179
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,370
aggressors worked out you could use

180
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,990
timing based attacks to verify your

181
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">sequin jection was working and similar</font>

182
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,310
so then parameterization<font color="#E5E5E5"> so then people</font>

183
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,169
worked out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could do stuff in</font>

184
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,820
you know oh come one more<font color="#E5E5E5"> logic based</font>

185
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:39,889
issues and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of get into the</font>

186
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,849
no sequel world but all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these again</font>

187
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:43,520
you know we have under

00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:46,339
we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> sold sequel injection in any</font>

still<font color="#E5E5E5"> find it as an opportunity for</font>

191
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:51,649
people to screw up I guess they're kind

192
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:54,289
of the better solutions we are seeing

193
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:57,349
now are where frameworks are coming in

194
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:59,808
the abstract the sequel technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

195
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:02,509
my sequel BMS sequel and it allow

196
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:03,830
developers to write queries and they

197
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,119
have to go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their way to break the</font>

198
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,520
security model but you know

199
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:08,899
fundamentally still not perfect this is

200
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,330
code is a great example as well

201
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:13,519
malicious codes<font color="#E5E5E5"> arrive we develop AV</font>

202
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,498
signatures attackers realize that they

203
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,529
develop<font color="#CCCCCC"> packers so don't match the</font>

204
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:20,449
signatures so AV companies develop

205
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:21,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">unpack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> herbs and then et cetera et</font>

206
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:22,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">cetera</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you kind of you see this</font>

207
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:24,740
backwards and forwards and so we're down

208
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:27,949
back basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> back down to the level</font>

209
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,199
now where we rely on binary reputation

210
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:33,199
in so like modern<font color="#E5E5E5"> semantic engines have</font>

211
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,209
for the last six six seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> years use</font>

212
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,099
kind of reputation<font color="#CCCCCC"> eleni ins to work out</font>

213
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:40,399
if you have if your machine is

214
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:41,899
considered dirty I you know you're John

215
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">whereas you download all the way as you</font>

216
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:45,589
keep getting infected when kind of new

217
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:47,869
signature updates they consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a</font>

218
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:49,669
dirty user so they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't trust the</font>

219
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:52,339
binaries you download so your reputation

220
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:55,128
is poor within the herd whereas kind of

221
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:57,229
my gran who only runs word and only kind

222
00:07:55,129 --> 00:08:00,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">of buyers her software and it has never</font>

225
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:06,378
generally considered<font color="#CCCCCC"> clean and set up</font>

226
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:07,789
the reputation of those so we're now at

227
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:11,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">the stage of where we use these</font>

228
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:13,490
reputational engines in<font color="#CCCCCC"> AV wait</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

predict that the race researchers

230
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,789
offensive researchers are going to work

231
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:18,800
out how to gain those reputational

232
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:20,688
systems that's a logical step in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

233
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,099
arms race right anyway basically this

234
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:23,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">will continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it will keep going and</font>

235
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:26,269
it will keep going but again we've not

236
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,610
solved malicious code because even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we</font>

237
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:32,419
have even if we do all of this as we

238
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:34,729
keep seeing with you know people<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

239
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,289
stuff for<font color="#E5E5E5"> free or cheap and so they'll</font>

240
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:38,509
get infected<font color="#CCCCCC"> by that way which is</font>

241
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:39,828
through social engineering memory

242
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:41,300
corruption is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those great car</font>

00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:44,329
crashes which is you know we've known<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

244
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:45,829
memory corruption I think was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1960s I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> karada was the first documented</font>

potential ramifications for arbitrary

248
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,490

here are kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> areas that have</font>

253
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,690
been attacked and basically the

254
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:08,180
subsequent kind of subversions to it so

255
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:10,370
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see like stack overflows we first</font>

256
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,870
went through they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> stack cookies</font>

257
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so people worked out that you</font>

258
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,870
didn't need to corrupt the stack cookie

259
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,270
what you could do is you could attack

260
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,430
variables on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> local stack so then</font>

261
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:21,680
introduced verbal reordering a compiler

262
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,839
level and a multi stack and similar all

263
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,569
of these they have been have required

265
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,040
pain<font color="#E5E5E5"> I develop a mitigation and then</font>

266
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,930
some smart-arse to come out and then

267
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,060
just kind of destroy it again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather</font>

268
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,099
than that being done proactively and

269
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,939
collaboratively by an attacking like

270
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,320
mindset during the initial development

271
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,630
similarly what we've seen in kind of

272
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,420
kernel and and and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other kind of</font>

273
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,670
mitigations as<font color="#CCCCCC"> times moved on we can see</font>

274
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that kind of sufficient mitigations have</font>

275
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,439

276
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,640
where return orientated programming

kind of subvert depp and those types of

have a performance impact both in terms

286
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,290
of memory and execution speed so we're

287
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,670
now at a stage where we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> having to</font>

288
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,040
make actually quite significant

289
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,540
trade-offs to actually produce these

290
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,579
mitigations which means they can't be

291
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,870
applied universally so what I'm saying

292
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:26,349
here is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more research to be</font>

293
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,730
done it is not solved by any stretch

294
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,320
code review so any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that do code</font>

295
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,420
review you would have started<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

296
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a school of grep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reppin for mem copy</font>

297
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,170
and dangerous functions and then you go

298
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,430
ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit crappy and then you go watch a</font>

299
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">tour like John butlers and you go from</font>

300
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,660
you know taint analysis that's amazing i

301
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,270
can now kind of do kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dodgy input</font>

302
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:47,029
too vulnerable code tracking and then

303
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,800
you start trying to wrap that up into an

304
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:50,750
expensive product<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Coverity and</font>

305
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,640
fortify and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you realize the false</font>

306
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,190
positives and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the noise it produces</font>

307
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,959
creates nose bleeding work with some

308
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,209
poor sap to sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and triage all of</font>

309
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,589
the issues so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you throw that out and go</font>

310
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:00,819
back to

311
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,830
your code review<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a smart team of</font>

312
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,200
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> which doesn't skate so again in</font>

313
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">cayuga is by no means solved the more</font>

314
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,210
interesting one here is the very game

315
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:13,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuffs a gamification what they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

316
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:15,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">is they've come up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a way of taking</font>

317
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:18,100
code snippets and automatically

318
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:20,620
generating puzzle games and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

319
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,870
you get people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play these games to</font>

320
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,630
provide you formal verification proofs

321
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,610
so you basically are using humans to

322
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,560
solve these<font color="#CCCCCC"> routes and I basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feed</font>

323
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,970
those into your proof models and I think

324
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,660
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually quite inspired you know</font>

325
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:36,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">thumbs up to a Washington and then DARPA</font>

326
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:40,719
for funding it but it's by no<font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font>

assault game sandboxing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we realized</font>

328
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,580
basically at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can't</font>

329
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,920
stop any of these being exploited and

330
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,450
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bit and causing us pain so into</font>

331
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,160
what can you do now is we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

332
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,270
try and contain the impact so we're

333
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,370
going to develop<font color="#CCCCCC"> these things called</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">sand boxes and I guess shuru was one of</font>

335
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,390
the first earliest ghettoest versions of

336
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,700
a sandbox we can restrict we're on the

337
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:03,040
file system something can read and<font color="#CCCCCC"> write</font>

338
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,510
from yep naturally it failed it took a

339
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,880
bright smart person to understand

340
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,920
actually how operating systems work to

work out<font color="#E5E5E5"> Harrow a handle inheritance</font>

00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,710
outside the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shahrukh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jails and so then</font>

344
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">they introduced them other many levels</font>

345
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,360
so we have to do filesystem networking

<font color="#CCCCCC">inter procedure interprocess procedure</font>

00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a fine art anyone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has tried to</font>

349
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,439
use things like a polymer or similar

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:31,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">sandboxing tools in the real world in a</font>

351
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,850

00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,720
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pain isn't just terms of</font>

353
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,100
configuring it and then no one will

354
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,940
provide you support because you've

355
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:44,950
sandboxed it again not solved in it easy

356
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:47,140
to workable manner so<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we go on to</font>

357
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:50,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">put a protective monitoring which is the</font>

358

360
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,660
do is I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to deploy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and IPS</font>

361
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,939
and they've run into all manner of

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,579
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know from reconstructing</font>

certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tim</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Newsham and similar go back</font>

to the old<font color="#E5E5E5"> days where they looked at all</font>

days 2000s

where they looked at how different OS is

370
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:20,580
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BSD</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s vs Linux vs windows all</font>

371
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:22,890
different all reconstruct out order

372
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,170
packets and different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways and then you</font>

373
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,970
work out as a network level protective

374
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,829
monitoring you need to implement all of

375
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,570
those so they release their paper how to

376
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,640
subvert every possible IDs there is on

377
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,900
the planet and then so<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs vendors have</font>

378
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,010
their pants<font color="#E5E5E5"> around their ankles and they</font>

379
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,350
run around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have to go and implement</font>

380
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,420
all of this new logic then we have all

381
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,220
the encryption problems and then kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> increasing network speeds etc etc</font>

383
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,320
all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> answers had to come through</font>

384
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:50,550
research by someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's still not</font>

385
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,200
solved and in forensics like forensics

386
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,790
is an absolute pain in the ass now the

387
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">reality is is that we had a forensics</font>

388
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:59,699
world where we did physical acquisition

389
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,100
and then we went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all the data and we</font>

390
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:05,460
Colombo dit basically the reality is now

391
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,230
is that the data sizes are so vast we're

392
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:10,440
having to do logical acquisition which

393
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:12,720
is we know or we suspect this went down

394
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,540
or we got an inkling this is where we

395
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,700
start let's now find positive proof of

396
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,589
that within the vast quantity of data

397
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we've got or where it you know</font>

398
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:24,240
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> owning email or something</font>

399
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar we've had to introduce memory</font>

400
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,680
forensics because again you know greg

401
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:33,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">was talking about anti forensics Knox</font>

402
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">not touching disk in like 2000 2001 hey</font>

403
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,720
what happened people started actually

404
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,180
using non<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk touching forensics</font>

405
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,890
techniques in terms of their payloads so

406
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,849
we now have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to introduce you know and</font>

407
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,830
actually understand how to use

00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,560
volatility and those types of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

409
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:50,580
doing in process memory reconstruction

410
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,170
from stomped<font color="#CCCCCC"> RAM we have to worry about</font>

analysis and correlation so palantir<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

413
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,750
guess is one of the leaders in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

414
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,760

415
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,890
between vast bodies of structured data

416
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,430
like email stores and unstructured data

417
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:08,160
that we may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have got from another source</font>

418
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:11,099
so expert systems in inference engines

419
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,439
there's a number of pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of research</font>

420
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,470
around this in terms of identifying

00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:20,640
certain attack patterns and or file

422
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:22,290
fragments in in disk images but it's a

423
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">fancy way of saying AI but it's not</font>

424
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:26,430
particularly AI<font color="#E5E5E5"> again not solved and is</font>

425
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:29,520
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get far far worse</font>

426
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:31,170
and it all needs answers honey pots

427
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:36,420
we've all seen the value<font color="#E5E5E5"> in honey pots</font>

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:38,279
in terms of sorry in terms of kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

429
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,779
threat Intel but the reality is now

430
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,220
we're not we have yes some people

431
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:43,110
scanning the internet and popping your

432
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,820
web server but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more client</font>

433
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,010
orientated world where potentially

434
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,620
mobile devices are being targeted how do

435
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:51,959
we emulate and build mobile and similar

436
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,120
kind of client-side driven honey pots so

437
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:56,040
again in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a semantic well just wear my</font>

438
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,200
experience came<font color="#E5E5E5"> from some of this now we</font>

439
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,939
had honey monkeys the visited websites

440
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,080
and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tried to get infected and</font>

441
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,420
that was all very good and it's highly

442
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">instrumented you know but the reality is</font>

443
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,979
that instrumentation is increasingly

444
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,660
difficult on mobile devices especially

445
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,240
if there are no<font color="#E5E5E5"> jail breaks available</font>

446
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">and similar so you know we have a lot of</font>

447
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,839
problems ahead of us so do we go down

448
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:18,870
the emulation room so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> build realize firmware in kind</font>

to simulate those<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile devices but we</font>

452
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">have you know a number of problems which</font>

453
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:30,390
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the answers to again hot</font>

454
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,800
patching so we had a desire or there was

455
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,300
people we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trout's</font>

456
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,189
windows and probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> still do they had</font>

457
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,740
to reboot to install all the security

458
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:40,020
updates so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> less respond they are</font>

459
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,850
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to introduce</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this ability to do</font>

460
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,100
hot patching which they didn't do in a

461
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,839
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases but they they provided it</font>

462
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,459
in certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> instances and the way they</font>

463
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,779
solved it was they put basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

464
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:50,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">button off at the beginning of key</font>

465
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:53,880
functions which has allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to</font>

466
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:57,029
inject code and hook the call flow but

467
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,680
then we've now got two opposing needs so

468
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:00,480
we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> call flow analysis which is</font>

469
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,180
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> rock mitigation and we've got a</font>

470
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,040
conscious way to hijack call flow to be

471
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,899
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do hot passion so we kind of</font>

472
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:11,250
this we have a real challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in</font>

473
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:13,110
terms of competing security defenses<font color="#E5E5E5"> drm</font>

474
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,660
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> DRM is a zero-sum game</font>

475
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:18,079
ultimately right so you have firstly

476
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,959
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> software based drm people</font>

477
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:24,688
produce cracks then so smart vendors

478
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,069
realized well there are some motivated

479
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:27,390
people in poorer countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> that like</font>

480
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:30,928
cracking software so we're going to

481
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:32,940
release<font color="#CCCCCC"> geographic specific gr drm so if</font>

482
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:34,860
they crack it for their locality it's

483
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,090
not a break once you use everywhere

484
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,918
model they have to kind of collect

485
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,409
copies from all the regions and crack it

486
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">in all the instances</font>

487
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,830
good you know so they were cracks but

488
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,300
they were constrained or they were

489
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,370
enterprising and driven they did it in

490
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:49,129
all regions anyway so they then come up

491
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">with kind of hardware based or supported</font>

492
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,270
drm and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what we see more</font>

493
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,380
now so if you look at netflix for

494
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,870
example netflix have these really

495
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,640
onerous requirements on hardware

496
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,739
security but there's been some real

497
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,730
clangers there you know like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the trusted</font>

498
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,010
execution environments and

499
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:06,650
vulnerabilities you know it still uses

500
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:09,530
an unlocked bootloader which allows you

501
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:11,360
to boot the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux box into a nun into</font>

502
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,730
single user mode while decrypting<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

503
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,320
encrypted file system and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

504
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,940
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> conditional access control which is</font>

505
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,950
kind of where we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> at now is like your</font>

506
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">sky box is using conditional access</font>

507
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:23,390
control to provide some drm capabilities

508
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,250
so what the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> realized there</font>

509
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:28,460
then is you have one legitimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> skybox</font>

510
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,990
and you have lots of others in parallel

511
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,910
which having a relationship but chained

512
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:34,310
up through that conditional access card

513
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,930
so they've not actually stopped it but

514
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,550
they've created places where they can

515
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:41,000
kill it if they identify it's happening

516
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:42,560
so partially solved but not perfect so

517
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,820
that's I've kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kind of crap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

518
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,440
spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty much crapping on</font>

519
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,820
all of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we haven't solved and</font>

520
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm now going to provide you lots more</font>

521
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,960
things we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't solved as</font>

522
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:53,630
well which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually quite interesting</font>

523
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:56,470
so we have so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we launched a cyber 10k</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

524
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:59,690
guess a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and we provided some</font>

525
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:02,720
challenges so the reality is is that

526
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:05,330
user and consumer let non-technical

527
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,250
people security awareness is still

528
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:10,100
shocking you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I get questioned their</font>

529
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:12,170
kind of the pet the parent question you

530
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,870
know should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do this should I do that</font>

531
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:16,970
you know why is this computer asking me

532
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:19,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a security decision from its</font>

533
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,630
antivirus and similar asking those types

534
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,429
of questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I parents is a is</font>

535
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:25,520
guaranteed to file especially if you

536
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:29,510
keep my barding so how do we we have not

537
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,879
solved how to raise or to kind of bring

538
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:34,540
awareness more<font color="#CCCCCC"> generally to a lot of our</font>

539
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:37,190
problems you know we have an entire

540
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:40,070
generation arguably that's used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

541
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,690
clicking through SSL dialog box errors

542
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,939
because they're used to seeing that so

543
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,890
many times internally you know and yet

544
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,620
we say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you shouldn't do that</font>

545
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:50,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">well the reality is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would challenge</font>

546
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,419
all of you to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you haven't</font>

547
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
clicked through one of those mo

548
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:56,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">what most recently to do your job so we</font>

549
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,130
can't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any trust in SL</font>

550
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:01,020
everyone wants you know tech city and

551
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,550
everyone wants to be a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a dot-com</font>

552
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,560
millionaire again no<font color="#E5E5E5"> one seems to</font>

553
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:07,350
remember the last bubble but anyway so

554
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,030
everyone's starting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> start-up again but</font>

555
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,219
the reality is is if you're trying to

556
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:14,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">get minimum viable product to market the</font>

557
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,720
last thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your mind is the what</font>

558
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:18,060
encryption algorithms or how to write

559
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,030
your code securely you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> wizzy bang</font>

560
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:22,379
features you want you know animations

561
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,760
and you want you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically what's</font>

562
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff is going to help you sell you</font>

563
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,620
really don't have time to secure your

564
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:30,660
patch your environment why would I do

565
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,340
that you know and similar things and

566
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,500
this is really born out if we take an

567
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,320
example where Mongo HQ was compromised

568
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:40,200
so those are familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> monger HQ is Mongo</font>

569
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,020
DB in the cloud there that was an

570
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,820
interesting set of ramifications so

572
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:50,460
cloud is one thing who's the client of

573
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:52,320
mongo HQ well actually it's a continual

574
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,030
integration provider what does a

575
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,399

being able to deploy into the cloud

579
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:05,879
because it's continual integration yeah

580
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,980
so no so this one database cloud

581
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,510
provider had a knock-on effect through

582

all of these little<font color="#E5E5E5"> startups that have</font>

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,910
point here is you know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do have</font>

585
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:22,139
incidents today we can't articulate the

00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:24,270
we can't quantify and measure the cost

587
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,820
and the impact what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you is</font>

how much time you spend doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a</font>

have a hard time kind of measuring and

quantifying kind of the impact of this

as one of our consultants told me

607
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:11,409
downstairs you know when they send out

enable macro because the email told them

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,380
that's absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> shocking and</font>

613
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,810
ridiculous right quite simply but that

00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:28,810
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the state today you know that's not</font>

615
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:31,780
anecdotal that is what we are seeing so

616
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:33,490
again when we send in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isle help desk</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the cutting edge and kind of I guess</font>

reputation stuff but quite quite simply

624
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:54,580
shocking but a fascinating area i think

625
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,160
you know because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a mixture of</font>

today you run out of space very quickly

on any same network any modern<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

the storage of network captures yet

enable these people to do that through

to then kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the red ones are the</font>

714
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">nationally obviously reasons but huge</font>

715
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:24,040
problem no real answers and then

716
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:27,220
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else so we are still</font>

717
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:29,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrestling we know in see that using</font>

00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,360
sprint f which is unbounded mem copy or

719
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:34,540
memory copy basically

720
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,850
is dangerous<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet we still have people</font>

721
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,710
like Terry and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Theresa in development</font>

722
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:41,919
teams<font color="#E5E5E5"> using this and we have still found</font>

723
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:44,350
no effective way from stopping because

724
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:47,620
the reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when you have to ship</font>

725
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:49,149
product you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to ship product and</font>

726
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,459
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reality and so you just kind</font>

727
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:53,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">of want the code to work automatic</font>

728
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,120
content security policy generation for

web apps and refinement<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet that would</font>

730
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">be hugely valuable if we could do it</font>

731
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:02,080
mapping attack surfaces of applications

732
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,630
of systems of networks and visualizing

733
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,500
that so people<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand kind of what</font>

734
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,450
they need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be concerned about</font>

735
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,090
penetration testers where they can

736
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:12,220
attack to demonstrate the risk we're

737
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:14,080
increasingly seeing the emergence in

742
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:25,270
now seeing the emergence of these kind

00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,460
of micro races which are they sit

744
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:29,020
between the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the cloud</font>

745
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:32,140
hypervisors and your application stack

746
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:34,150
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot more refined I bet if</font>

00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">you look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any of those it will be like</font>

shooting fish in a barrel from a

749
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:39,070
security perspective so if you are an

750
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:40,600
offensive researcher and you want to

751
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,850
have kind of your next<font color="#E5E5E5"> black cat talk</font>

757

758
00:27:54,940 --> 00:28:01,000
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun software-defined networking</font>

759
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:03,070
so some bright spark says we're going to

760
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,419
take our traditional networking which

761
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:08,950
has a control plane and a data plane and

762
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,360
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw out that model and</font>

763
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:13,299
we're going to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a world where</font>

764
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can dynamically reconfigure our data</font>

765
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:18,490
plane through some nebulous software

766
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:20,740
that has many inputs and is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart</font>

767
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:22,390
and again no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think has kind</font>

768
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,309
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> systemically taken a pass off with</font>

769
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,809
the fine networking to show what the

770
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:29,139
ramifications are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of lack of</font>

771
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:31,270
segregation so how would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that in</font>

772
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:33,160
a secure way people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> now using anti</font>

773
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:35,950
forensic so we now need anti anti

774
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,870
forensics or the orange tree is great

775
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:39,280
for kind of sexy words or offensive

776
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:41,110
forensics as I saw which is the

777
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">application of forensic like techniques</font>

778
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:44,260
by aggressors to extract forensic

780
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:50,170
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's called hacking isn't</font>

781
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:52,210
it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway and then actually making</font>

782
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:54,960
certain Linux security features and

783
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:57,970
similar so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're if you're tin-pot</font>

784
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,710

probably don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn a parma you</font>

00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,410
want everything to run as root because

787
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:04,840
it works first time when you build that

788
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:06,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">appliance right so how do we you know</font>

789
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,490
linux and similar operating systems have

790
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:11,740
very robust security models how do we

791
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:15,460
actually make it usable and easy to use

792
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:20,260
for these<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-skilled loan center wise</font>

vendors in foreign lands and UK but you

794
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,740
know we kind of you kind of see a

have that system and the reward for

<font color="#CCCCCC">doing all of this really diligent</font>

798
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,800
defensive security research you don't

801
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,699
to Hawaii to Singapore people probably

802
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,780
complain when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work because</font>

803
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,580
they've not actually read the

documentation you diligently provided

the BBC won't cover it because who likes

good news you know Jim saved us from a

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciation that we've got so on</font>

the happy you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think personally</font>

814
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:11,590
defensive research is one of the most

815
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:13,450
rewarding areas in so much as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can see</font>

816
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:16,179
my defensive research has existed in

817
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:18,310
product for far longer and had a far

818
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,080
wider impact than that one bug I found

819
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:22,149
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one bullshit product it's in a</font>

820
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,919
piece of code<font color="#CCCCCC"> that died you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I can</font>

821
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,900
find a bar<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gainey day and it will be</font>

822
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,760
closed when the vendor fixes it but the

823
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,920
remediation or the mitigation or the

824
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,260
design principle that came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

825
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,270
lasted for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years that's pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rad</font>

826
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,190
and I and I personally enjoy that I

827
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:37,750
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to be an academic I</font>

828
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:39,790
struggle with academics quite a lot

829
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I don't think they have a grasp</font>

830
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,700
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real world because they have</font>

831
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,379
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else's money to spend whereas</font>

832
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:47,170
we're kind of a bit more attuned to the

833
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,460
real kind of pressures of life and you

834
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,250
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say out to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solve world</font>

835
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:54,850
hunger<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you set out and go I don't</font>

836
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,960
to solve some unrealistic goal well go

837
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,939
big or go home or

838
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,070
but you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you can start small</font>

839
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,540
and iteratively grow and I think really

840
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:05,439
the trick is<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah we see lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of smart</font>

841
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:08,170
ideas but unless you get traction and

842
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,750
actually them used and deployed and

843
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:13,540
people behind you<font color="#E5E5E5"> they just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

844
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:15,970
right and so the reality is is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

845
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,770
of start grassroots and kind of build

846
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,750
them in and you know submit patches to

847
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:21,970
open-source products and kind of just

848
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:24,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of Bajor people and Lobby and</font>

849
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:26,080
similar and so here's a great example so

850
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have a lot of respect for the pact</font>

851
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,500
team so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for those aren't familiar</font>

852
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">pax is basically a lot of exploit</font>

853
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:35,440
mitigations stuff which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was built into</font>

854
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:40,000
linux over the years six years ago they

855
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:42,730
came up with you direct air and then

856
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">intel ended up implemented in silicon</font>

857
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:46,450
which i think is pretty rad it's the

858
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:49,030
same technology that they developed as

859
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:52,420
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source patch to linux to stop</font>

860
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:55,540
kind of exploitation from Colonel to

861
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:58,240
user land to executing code in user land

862
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:01,300
from Colonel and then kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Intel come</font>

863
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,520
along and<font color="#CCCCCC"> implement in silicon and if</font>

864
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:06,000
that's not a validation that you at home

865
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:08,410
you know team packs is depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your</font>

866
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,600
belief is either<font color="#CCCCCC"> one's really smart</font>

867
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:12,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hungarian or two really smart Hungarians</font>

868
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,780
but it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than that and if</font>

869
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:15,790
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do that six years before</font>

870
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:19,420
Intel realize they should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it I</font>

871
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:21,070
think that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty smart so if</font>

872
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:24,390
you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this Manchester b-sides is</font>

873
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:27,700
coming and this is the final four really

874
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:29,920
is at the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> we focus on at least</font>

875
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,780
defensively generally trying to stop all

876
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,330
the vulnerabilities that's our strategy

877
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:36,010
that's not going to work I think fishing

878
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:38,470
has shown us that right we can solve

879
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:41,050
technology problems we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can create</font>

880
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:43,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">systems so secure they're not usable you</font>

881
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:45,070
know we're successful at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of this the</font>

882
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:48,129
reality is is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be</font>

883
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:51,010
designing constructing researching

884
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:52,690
systems that are just far better with

885
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,850
coping with successful compromise

886
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:57,520
limiting the impact when that happens

887
00:32:54,850 --> 00:33:00,760
and being able to kind of provably clean

888
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,810
up afterwards and<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless we do that it's</font>

889
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,430
just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the pain is going to</font>

890
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:05,350
continue because that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fundamental</font>

891
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:07,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem you will not stop people getting</font>

892
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:09,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">it yeah and</font>

893
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,580
I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on that note oh yeah</font>

894
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:14,730
here is it here's the reality as well

895
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:17,100
final bit you should all fail if you do

896
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:19,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">this expect to fail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> failure is good</font>

897
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:23,039
otherwise it's not research we know the

898
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:25,860
answers so I know we internally ncc

899
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:28,529
sometimes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> show how I fail so its</font>

900
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:31,260
educational it's fun and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

901
00:33:28,529 --> 00:33:33,330
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> to but they set out to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

902
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,529
knock their research out of the park you

903
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,789
know that's why you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on offensive</font>

904
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:38,010
because easy because you know you'll get

905
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:39,750
root in the end you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just kind</font>

906
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:41,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">of finding the right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bug finding the</font>

907
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:44,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">right piece of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> software if you set out</font>

908
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:45,809
on some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the defensive streams it may</font>

909
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:47,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">not come to anything it may not be</font>

910
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:51,539
workable you may be 10 years ahead of

911
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:53,610
the time when it's ready but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's fun so</font>

912
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:57,299
on that this is a conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will</font>

913
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:59,610
never exist but we can have a dream you

914
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:02,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">know I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that the defensive</font>

915
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:05,760
research will ever have a black cat or a

916
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:09,599
sigh scan or Chaka Khan in Hawaii or

917
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:12,570
anything else like that but well this is

918
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,700
it yes yeah but we you know we may have

919
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:16,889
a defend to spend competition to fight

920
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:18,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">poet alone and things like that but the</font>

921
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:20,580
reality is is that it is

922
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:23,609
underappreciated but it is extremely

923
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:25,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">valuable and so I hope that you know we</font>

924
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:28,799
do more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it as an industry and just</font>

925
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,849
kind of be the silent success almost so

926
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,599
now I'm quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to take any</font>

927
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:44,700
questions not sure there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

928
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:46,589
comments etc yes sir a lot of what

929
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:48,810
you're speaking about here is problems

930
00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:53,399
with the wider community that uses the

931
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:56,070
products yep and every time I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a a</font>

932
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:57,990
con people say well we its lack of

933
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:00,570
education we need to educate these

934
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:03,299
people but<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who completely</font>

935
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:05,250
understand the issues pull down their

936
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,410
firewalls because they think it'll make

937
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet running faster and you talk</font>

938
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:10,379
to them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they understand what a</font>

939
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:12,359
firewall is they understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> this people</font>

940
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,760
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then they</font>

941
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:17,940
understand all of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they still do</font>

942
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:20,970
it and it's not like<font color="#CCCCCC"> once or twice that</font>

943
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's one case i can think of and again</font>

944
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:24,709
the game because people think for some

945
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:27,270
reason that yeah this is all happening

946
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:29,130
but it won't happen to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me well all the</font>

947
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,930
reality is is that to repair you can

948
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:32,369
have the most spending firewalls in the

949
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,080
world but if you've got no<font color="#CCCCCC"> business to</font>

950
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:36,330
pay for those firewalls you're doing it

951
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:39,180
wrong so the reality is is we end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

952
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:40,980
seeing that the motivators are get stuff

953
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:43,440
done because what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business demands</font>

954
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:45,119
it's too complex I don't have the skills

955
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,670
all the time we're under a time pressure

956
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,859
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be making it easier we</font>

957
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:52,310
should be able to show and articulate

958
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:56,069
the benefits of doing it how

959
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:57,960
difficulties far wall on firewall off

960
00:35:56,069 --> 00:36:00,270
and the user still makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrong</font>

961
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,400
choice but<font color="#E5E5E5"> insist well is it the wrong</font>

962
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:04,920
choice if I have to transfer a 3

963
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,839
terabyte file and that gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a 50 it</font>

964
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,670
makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it fifty percent faster and I'm</font>

965
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:10,380
under a time pressure probably a

966
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,910
business risk if that's temporary just

967
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">for that transfer or those sets of</font>

968
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:15,060
transfers probably isn't the wrong

969
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:17,550
decision it has to be risk managed you

970
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:20,069
know but are these people making it from

971
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">an informed decision probably not and</font>

972
00:36:20,069 --> 00:36:24,779
that's that's a different question but

973
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:26,759
you know better<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools you know making</font>

974
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,230
sure that I turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> that firewall on after</font>

975
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,330
I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that before I go down the pub</font>

976
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:32,330
that's a different trick yeah

977
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">Yeah right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they look exactly like a</font>

978
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:46,600
lot of device manufacturers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one it</font>

979
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:47,710
is rude because it just works first time

980
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,900
and they'll have the best intentions

981
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,280
that they'll they'll lock that down as

982
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,170
they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you know closer to</font>

983
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,330
closer to release and just the time

984
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:57,700
evaporates right and the reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you</font>

985
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:59,290
know we've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to ship it get out</font>

986
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">the door and make some money people you</font>

987
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:02,620
know welcome to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world and that's why</font>

988
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,820
you pay about<font color="#E5E5E5"> seventy percent or for</font>

989
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:07,170
government systems because there are

990
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,170
actually a security which is considered

991
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well thank you very much email jeff</font>

992
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:21,279
sorry one more<font color="#CCCCCC"> question not so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much a</font>

993
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:24,550
question actually but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you were</font>

994
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,250
saying that the u.s. all over

995
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:29,020
dramatizing with the risk to life I mean

996
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:31,300
of course you do have embedded medical

997
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:35,500
appliances these days pacemakers and the

998

it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take something dramatic</font>
