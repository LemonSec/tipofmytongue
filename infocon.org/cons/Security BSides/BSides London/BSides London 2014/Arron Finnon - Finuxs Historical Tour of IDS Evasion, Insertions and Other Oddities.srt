15
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:10,700
so Who am I well my name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron I went</font>

16
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,080
for a company called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alba 13 I'm a</font>

17
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,330
you've all watched me grow over the

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,420
years I've now achieved security officer

19
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:23,810
which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I get to troll at a sea</font>

20
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:27,920
level position you can get me at Phoenix

21
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:31,950
we do do some podcasting occasionally

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:37,950
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I troll quite a bit but it's just</font>

23
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:39,539
because I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so I'm going to talk</font>

24
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">about network intrusion prevention</font>

25
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:45,810
systems all the dead technologies we

26
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:49,380
like to call it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this technology</font>

27
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:52,159
that is probably people who haven't come

28
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:56,818
to this talk because it's about IPS

29
00:01:52,159 --> 00:02:03,390
right like oh no no no<font color="#CCCCCC"> i PSI PSS shit</font>

30
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:07,880
shit shit and yet in 2010<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gartland</font>

31
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:10,380
believes and standalone IPS products 989

32
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,380
million dollars so we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just say a</font>

33
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:17,579
billion between friends we spent on

34
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:20,959
standalone IPS products<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok billion</font>

35
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:24,920
dollars for a dead technology in 2010

36
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:28,310
phenix why are you picking on 2010 well

37
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:31,410
2010 is the beginning of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> European</font>

38
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:36,510
recession we bail out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> European</font>

39
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:39,450
countries in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that time I used to think a</font>

40
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,519
billion dollars was a big number as a

41
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,828
yay billion dollars you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know let's give</font>

42
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,780
some context to that number and then

43
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:47,340
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> told me what you know average</font>

44
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">Lee the Americans spend a billion</font>

45
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,670
dollars a year on chewing gum so maybe

46
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:57,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not so big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after all but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

47
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,760
to talk about IPS anyone that's known me

48
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:04,380
will know that I've spent a large

49
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:08,638
portion of my career focusing on IPS but

50
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:11,970
not a vendor layer but as a tester

51
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,739
because we have an industry that spends

52
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,150
billions and billions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> billions of</font>

53
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:18,939
dollars on products

54
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,110
that don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work okay yeah I told you</font>

55
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:27,069
something you didn't know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> other news</font>

56
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:29,200
water is wet right NSS well I watched a

57
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:32,260
very very interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk a little</font>

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,589
while ago from a guy called Johnny for

59
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:38,470
Flynn who is part of the detection team

60
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,780
at Facebook and what he did<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he went</font>

61
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,640
through the gartner and Verizon reports

62
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,670
and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth and it was all</font>

63
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,409
very interesting so it turns out

64
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,649
compromised if you don't detect a

65
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:53,260
compromise<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight away the likelihood</font>

66
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:58,209
is is going to be between 18 to 24

67
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:59,828
months before you pick it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so out</font>

68
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:03,239
of those compromises in the garden

69
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:03,239
report that were picked up later on

70
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:09,909
nearly half of those that were picked up

71
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:12,790
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing different than a user</font>

72
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:15,220
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh my system isn't working the way</font>

73
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,560
I expected<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to work basically the</font>

74
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:21,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">smell past it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

75
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,229
doesn't feel quite right nearly half<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

76
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,150
compromises in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gartner and Verizon</font>

77
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:28,419
reports are literally used as saying

78
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:32,409
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not working after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the next</font>

79
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:34,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">biggest indicator of compromise is third</font>

80
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:37,990
parties what do you mean third parties

81
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,440
what I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the bank calling you up</font>

82
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:43,210
and saying hey why are you transferring

83
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,280
$50,000 to Malaysia we think you might

84
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:51,070
be compromised I think you might be

85
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:55,510
right after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in detecting</font>

86
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:59,680
compromises eight-point-five percent of

87
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:01,599
the time random<font color="#E5E5E5"> log review if you all</font>

88
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,460
notice that the IPS guy talking about

89
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:05,500
IPS hasn't mentioned IPS in the

90
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:09,400
compromising part yet of detecting

91
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:12,180
compromises three-point-five percent of

92
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,099
the time and IPS picks up a compromise

93
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:18,099
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just bring this a little bit</font>

94
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:21,159
back random person<font color="#CCCCCC"> randomly checking</font>

95
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:25,539
random<font color="#E5E5E5"> lobs is more successfully it's</font>

96
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:27,950
successful randomly than multi-billion

97
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:29,870
dollar industry

98
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,340
so I'm all time telling you stuff that

99
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,400
you already know let's be honest video

100
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:37,820
I'm not I'm not showing you the bright

101
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,159
light you know what happens is is we

102
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:43,060
have an industry where we as security

103
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,030
professionals allow an industry to suck

104
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you I let this lesson</font>

105
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,359
in austria by the way so you can blame

00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Austrians to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this can you all raise</font>

111
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,690
with an IPS vendor right keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> your hands</font>

112
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,000
up if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ever had to deal with an IPS</font>

113

blender how many of you were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">a straight answer about detection rates</font>

115
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:17,270
oh look why is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one has their</font>

116
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:21,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">hands on because they don't talk about</font>

117
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:23,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">it it's about throughput you know I buy</font>

118
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,520
a very expensive piece of detection

119
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:28,280
capability and you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to</font>

120
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">me about the 10,000 simultaneous</font>

121
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,739
connections that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can make fucking</font>

122
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,990
awesome thanks but but we can handle 10

123
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,290
gig full duplex that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> brilliant but</font>

124
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:41,120
what can you detect but we can have

125
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,890
50,000 simultaneous user profiles it

126
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,280
should fuck up what is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

127
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:49,190
detect you know if they don't tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us we</font>

128
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:53,650
have an industry a multi-billion dollar

129
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:56,480
industry the does not sell on detection

130
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:59,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok the clues in the name intrusion</font>

131
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:03,380
detection systems we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't talk about it</font>

132
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:06,260
action it's like a cartel you know the

133
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,360
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IPS club the first rule of ips Club</font>

134
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,480
is you don't talk about detection rates

135
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,780
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think the second rule is</font>

136
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:18,770
don't talk about detection rates so if

137
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:22,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have a concept about what intrusion</font>

138
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:26,000
prevention systems a similar market

139
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:29,690
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about sports cars where</font>

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,720
the van der sells it on the gps not how

141
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:34,790
fast it goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so can you imagine</font>

142
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,030
buying a Ferrari how fast does it go or

143
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:39,460
we've got a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS system</font>

144
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:42,669

<font color="#CCCCCC">air-conditioning how fast do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go no</font>

146
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:48,280
no we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a great surround sound</font>

147
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:50,650
stereo with USB you know we we we have

148
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">an industry where we allow that most of</font>

149
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:57,280
us know these systems suck and what do

150
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:59,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">we do we allow them to suck we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

151
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,919
question it because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> shit that's how</font>

152
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:06,370
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do business we accepted to failure</font>

153
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:09,280
the problem is is that in our IPS

154
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:12,730
context some stuff is really difficult

155
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,739
to declare right detection is not an

156
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:18,310
easy business by any stretch of the

157
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:21,580
imagination how many times do you think

158
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:23,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">I get asked about if we worked out</font>

159
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,570
detection rates for IPS do we not think

160
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the industry become like the AV</font>

161
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:30,580
industry I swear<font color="#E5E5E5"> to God if I just had a</font>

164
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:39,310
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on my island but the problem is</font>

165
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,620
is that we don't verify how effective

166
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:44,829
they are the problem is there's a lot of

167
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:48,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that they have to do protocols</font>

168
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:52,510
are a complicated business<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

169
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:55,270
detection is not simple so in 96 we

170
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:59,770
start to see what we consider the heyday

171
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:03,819
of breaking IDS's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sherman</font>

172
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:05,800
patate release a paper and it is the

173
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,330
beginning of the end for the you know

174
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,819
the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that detects all the things</font>

175
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:13,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">will save the cyber kingdom from the</font>

176
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:18,910
cyber bad guys cyber cyber cyber right

177
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:24,010
96 and what happens is we have a heyday

178
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:29,410
in messing around with protocols and a

179
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:31,240
lot of the stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> is within</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the realms of</font>

180
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,219
what's acceptable within a protocol

181
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,200
against what isn't acceptable in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

182
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,520
protocol so we have this rule i'm going

183
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,110
to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about it later on</font>

184
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">but when you do like a protocol</font>

185
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,780
implementer you have this rule way they

186
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:46,420
basically say send conservatively but

187
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:48,860
receive liberally which means be very

188
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:51,670
very specific in what you send out

189
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:55,610
be very very open in what you allow

190
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:57,349
which sounds fucking awesome until

191
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're the poor bastard that actually</font>

192
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:03,770
has to detect shit and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> maps okay</font>

193
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:08,210
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some IDs evasion techniques</font>

194
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:13,010
that were available during 96 this shit

195
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:15,500
still works<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and if you look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at once</font>

196
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:18,490
some of the things that that an<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs has</font>

197
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:22,180
to do so in IDs someone once said to me

198
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:24,680
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs has to be like a web server</font>

199
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,599
really where does an IDs have to be like

200
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,260
a web server well an IDs has to

201
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,600
understand web attacks well no an IDs

202
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,970
has to be like every<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking web server</font>

203
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,430
then because implementations are

204
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:41,270
different and never<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind the protocol</font>

205
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:42,800
issues so in protocol in HTTP there's a

206
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">beautiful that one of the first</font>

207
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,719
beautiful attacks against and invasion

208
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,819
against the IDS static string analysis

209
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,150
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things work we take a</font>

210
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:55,900
string and if it looks bad we do an

211
00:10:53,150 --> 00:11:00,020
alert what could possibly<font color="#CCCCCC"> go wrong well</font>

212
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:04,760
what could possibly go wrong is if you

213
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:07,370
can imagine a get request<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok HTTP well</font>

214
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,730
you know get HTTP four slash

215
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:14,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah evil payload</font>

216
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:19,700
HTML version 1.1<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that nice little</font>

217
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:22,610
simple string well if you see invalid

218
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,530
HTTP version lot this was an amazing

219
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:28,370
technique that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was discovered in 96</font>

220
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:32,660
where you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bit that says HTTP</font>

221
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:34,760
version 1.1 apparently and it still does

222
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:38,209
work from time to time if you change the

223
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">dot to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a comma the static string</font>

224
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,850
analysis doesn't work anymore because

225
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:46,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">they hadn't wrote a rule that covered up</font>

226
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:49,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">did arm invalid version numbering</font>

227
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,910
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember the key word here is</font>

228
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:54,710
resent liberally up<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent conservative</font>

229
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,839
receive liberally so what's happening is

230
00:11:54,710 --> 00:12:00,560
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> implement in saying you obviously</font>

231
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:03,170
meant a dot you didn't mean a comma<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

232
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,569
invalid version number what's the

233
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:11,180
highest HTTP version that you can go 1.1

234
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:15,800
well it turns<font color="#CCCCCC"> out that if you do a</font>

235
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:19,219
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> request for 1.8 you don't get an</font>

236
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:23,089
error condition you just get the next

237
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:25,730
available HTTP version which is 1.1 and

238
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:27,529
nothing happens what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think happens</font>

239
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:32,150
to start string analysis at this point

240
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:34,460
it's not there<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's over directory</font>

241
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:39,709
self-referencing how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you are web</font>

shit<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have worked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on IPS apparently</font>

245
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:51,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">it fucking does but you have to look at</font>

246
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,110
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues that we have here</font>

247
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:56,630
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff is just being a bit</font>

248
00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:00,589
freaky with the protocol you know doing

249
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:03,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">something a bit cheeky</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i as a pendrick</font>

251
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:09,079
little bit cheeky but when you look at

252
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:11,780
chunked HTTP chump this is when you

253
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:15,470
really start to realize the issue so

254
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:20,209
when we look at compression<font color="#CCCCCC"> and HTTP</font>

255
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:22,280
requests what happens is generally if

256
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,930
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like use gzip Tour de Flay or</font>

257
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,089
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this what happens is it</font>

258
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:29,120
tells you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> length of the payload</font>

259
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:31,820
that's coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay because that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

260
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">fucking handy hey I know how much they</font>

261
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,160
aren't going to get awesome and it's

262
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,540
easy for an IPS this is ok I know how

263
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,300
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get this is how</font>

265
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:49,430

266
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:52,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">have is the potential for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a stream to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">continually to go on and on and on and</font>

268
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,450
on and on there is no at the beginning

269
00:13:54,650 --> 00:14:00,350
party there is no this is going to be to

270
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:02,750
Mack ok it is chunk data that is just

271
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:05,870
scent and scent and scent and scent now

272
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:07,180
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about this is an IPS we have</font>

273
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,660
two options

274
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:13,420
we buffer everything and then we analyze

275
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:17,199
it once we think the buffer is full that

276
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:19,180
we've got the full payload what could

277
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">possibly go wrong if you give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me an</font>

278
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,620
unlimited amount of storage on your IPS

279
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:31,320
i can guarantee you're gonna fell open

280
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:34,060
in about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or you say map</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

281
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:37,710
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was something that hmm who</font>

282
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:41,829
cares what do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually happens</font>

283
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:44,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">hmm who cares that's what happens we</font>

284
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,750
still can't fix the trunk problem

285
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:51,940
because the protocol allows us to do

286
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:54,790
this why don't we block HTTP chand why

287
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:59,110
don't we do that that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea ya</font>

288
00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:01,030
know if you do this you basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> break</font>

289
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,970
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much all of the streaming</font>

290

fucking love<font color="#CCCCCC"> you when you can't use</font>

292
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,740
YouTube anymore that's what you get for

293
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,520
doing that but this is the protocol that

294
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:19,090
our IPS industry has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with and yet</font>

295
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:22,180
what we do is we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about these</font>

296
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:23,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems we just say IPS a shit and you</font>

297
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:27,310
let them<font color="#E5E5E5"> get away with it and we don't</font>

298
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:29,140
test them on the important stuff there

299
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:31,959
is not a solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean we</font>

300
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:36,189
get to pack up shop and go home we still

301
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:39,930
have to do stuff random case<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs this</font>

302
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:42,790
is fucking beautiful right it turns out

303
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:44,979
who would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have thought it that case</font>

304
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,839
sensitivity on a window system is

305
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">different than case sensitivity on a</font>

306
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:52,900
Linux system right course<font color="#CCCCCC"> phenix we know</font>

307
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:55,690
this so stoic string analysis on a

308
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">window system I can just put it all in</font>

309
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,680
capitals and if you've got your static

310
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,120
string in<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower case guess what I'm</font>

311
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,439
going through your stag string analysis

312
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,270
makes a difference on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows system</font>

313
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,620
but it doesn't make it makes a

314
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,350
difference on a Linux system it doesn't

315
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,250
make a difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a window system</font>

316
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well what we're going to do then is</font>

317
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:16,660
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a patchy right</font>

318
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,779
because you know it's linux apache lump

319
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,300
a

320
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:25,240
right but you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apache on a</font>

321
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:28,819
Windows system the problem is is that

322
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,439
now you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an Apache deployment that</font>

323
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:33,860
is either case sensitive on the Linux

00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:37,748
box or not Oh case insensitive on a

325
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:40,759
windows box and use some<font color="#CCCCCC"> howard zinn ids</font>

00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:54,709
interesting issues and what the ball

331
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,689
down to ultimately a lot of these HTTP

332
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:59,628
of asians are boiled down to protocol

333
00:16:56,689 --> 00:17:02,870
ambiguities I like my protocols

334
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:05,209
ambiguous<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all of you are wondering</font>

that's Colin MacLean the beloved dr.

here to fuck him that does not surprise

339
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:24,799
but protocol ambiguities what I've just

340
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:26,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about about systems having</font>

differences we're just talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

342
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:33,200
OS then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that what the</font>

343
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:35,450
protocol can get up to because what i

344
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:40,610
can tell you ladies and gentlemen is is

345
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:42,559
if you go to a RFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay a request for</font>

346
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,830
comments document that's supposed to

347
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,750
clearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> lay out how a protocol works yet</font>

348
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:53,360
they're not actually very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at doing</font>

349
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:56,059
that casing example tcp one of the most

350
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,030
important protocols that we have has so

351
00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:01,399
many fucking<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray areas in the RFC that</font>

352
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,440
it will continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep on giving those</font>

353
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:08,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">IDs evasion techniques until we find</font>

354
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:13,070
something else such as you're able to

355
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:14,899
send segments in<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp and in IP you we</font>

356
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,840
call those fragments but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp we new</font>

357
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:21,889
segments and you can use you can rewrite

358
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,049
a data stream mid transit by moving the

359
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:27,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">segments about the of circus they're not</font>

360
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:29,870
ordered they tend to be sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to</font>

361
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,890
ttp segments but theoretically the

362
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,530
design not to be sent

363
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:38,510
ordered<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what you can do is you</font>

364
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:40,820
can rewrite packets mid transit but it's

365
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:44,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">not clearly defined in the protocol</font>

366
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:47,179
which offset takes precedence ok they

367
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,850
don't clearly define this so who would

368
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,770
have thought it that two competing

369
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,689
operating systems would do things

370
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:56,360
differently<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would have seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

371
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:58,670
coming of course poor little IPS

372
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,760
multi-billion dollar industry has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

373
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:04,280
work that shit out so windows will

374
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">always favor newer data over old data</font>

375
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:09,350
and you bet your ass UNIX will do

376
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:14,060
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> the opposite hey we didn't</font>

377
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:16,610
see that coming did we so not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only now</font>

378
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:19,760
do we have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> within a protocol that</font>

379
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:22,310
we can do that it is a little bit hinky

380
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,080
we also then have to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the areas</font>

381
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:30,399
within a protocol that are not clearly

382
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:32,840
defined such as an interesting story so

383
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,330
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a type of an attack called an</font>

384
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:39,860
insurgent attack and what happens here

385
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:42,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">is you you insert extra packets into the</font>

386
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:46,100
stream to camouflage what you're up to

387
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:48,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it turns out that IPS vendors we're</font>

388
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:52,340
not checking the IP checksum in the IP

389
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:54,169
packets they were just accepting it so

390
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:58,699
what we figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out was that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we you can</font>

391
00:19:54,170 --> 00:20:00,230
send packets that we know as soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you</font>

392
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,810
hit an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet router because the</font>

393
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,460
protocol clearly defines that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font>

394
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:07,610
to drop a packet with an invalid checks

00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:11,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">are right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of years before we</font>

396
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:15,199
worked out how bad we fucked that one up

397
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:18,670
so you're able to hide like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know put</font>

398
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,020
in extra pocket so evil payload HTML

399
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:22,580
didn't read that anymore but the minute

400
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:26,600
that it hit an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet facing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> router</font>

401
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:28,010
all the camouflage disappeared so not

402
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">only do we have a system now where we</font>

403
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:32,420
have protocols that are not clearly

404
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:35,360
defined protocols that are dependent<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:38,290
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating systems around them we</font>

406
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,840
also now have a situation where we have

00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:44,450
implementers or people implementing

408
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:50,389

00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:57,740
you use Fitbit Wow who would have

411
00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:01,719
thought geeks don't do Fitbit we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

412
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:04,970
conform to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a stereotype whatsoever so</font>

413
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,360
there's the interesting story that the

414
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:10,550
protocol clearly defines an HT an HTTP

415
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,340
request that you have a user agent

416
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:15,200
string hey I'm Firefox see you know how

417
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,570
we all get fucked over on Android device

418
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,270
because we'll go to some site and it got

419
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,770
hard download our up no no we don't want

420
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,389
to download<font color="#CCCCCC"> route I've just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

421
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,520
forgotten what your web request is but

422
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:27,710
hey download<font color="#E5E5E5"> our app we have this all</font>

423
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:36,139
the time but<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is through the user</font>

424
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:39,400
agent string so Fitbit decided we don't

425
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:42,080
need a user agent string fuck that shit

426
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,450
so you have this little Fitbit device to

427
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,159
count your footsteps<font color="#CCCCCC"> calls</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back home to</font>

428
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,260
little web server I'm sure you've all

429
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,670
seen the tweets that's when we know our

430
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,379
friends are lazy it's like you've taken

431
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:53,960
five footsteps you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really want to</font>

432
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,850
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> tweeting that shit you know if you've</font>

433
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:01,610
walked three miles then we'll pat you on

434
00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:04,820
the back but otherwise so Fitbit sends

435
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:09,520
its data up in the cloud we you've

436
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:09,520
walked this whoo cloud all the things

437
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,830
hard problem is is that so Fitbit Fitbit

438
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,170
devs are a little bit lazy they haven't

439
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:21,350
put a user agent string in you know who

440
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:23,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">else is a little bit lazy malware</font>

441
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:27,260
authors they don't like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put user</font>

442
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:30,919
agent strings in so what do you think

443
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:34,250
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you have a Fitbit on an</font>

444
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:36,790
area may be guarded by a snort box hey

445
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:42,320
we mean a type of a Chinese malware know

446
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:44,780
your users are just walking all right

447
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,000
it's so good the cyber kingdom safe

448
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,290
brother don't worry so<font color="#E5E5E5"> get no need for</font>

449
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,330
the size of<font color="#CCCCCC"> fire trucks and the cyber</font>

450
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:54,750
war we're okay thank

451
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:57,840
so now just<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I've started we've</font>

452
00:22:54,750 --> 00:23:02,000
covered just the interesting fact that

453
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">we now have protocols that are ambiguous</font>

454
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:11,100
we have interpreting protocols that

455
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:13,470
don't conform to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocol we have</font>

456
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,540
operating system issues as well as

457
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:18,240
application issues and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

458
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:21,030
multi-billion dollar industry somehow

459
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,950
has to detect stuff but we give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

460
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:25,620
blank pass because it shits of dead

461
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:28,110
technology we don't test them you don't

462
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">push them as I said earlier the real</font>

463
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,949
issue here is 10 conservative

464
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:35,720
conservatively and receive liberally

465
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:38,900
look if you stop that from happening

466
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:42,300
then we break parts of the internet and

467
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:46,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's not even get into some really</font>

468
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:50,669
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the beloved</font>

469
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:55,679
Steve Lord of 44<font color="#E5E5E5"> Khan who who isn't here</font>

470
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:58,020
either so fuck him too once tweeted me

471
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,960
said the 90s called we want your flag

472
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:02,250
flag and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sore sport</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tricks but now like</font>

473
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,030
you can't fucking have them I'm still

474
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:07,440
using them right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's true so we've</font>

475
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,700
gone through some of the issues and

476
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:14,570
protocols but what's really interesting

477
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:16,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">is 98 sees this really big push in</font>

478
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:19,770
really playing about with the protocol

479
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:23,580
doing some kinky stuff so we talked

480
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:25,740
about offsets with packets and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

481
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:30,270
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can rewrite packets and that's all</font>

482
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:32,730
confusing then let's talk about flags so

483
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:36,080
if i send<font color="#CCCCCC"> a packet that rewrites the</font>

484
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:38,970
pocket but they both have a flag that

485
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:42,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened to be different which one takes</font>

486
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:44,880
precedence surprise surprise not clearly

487
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:47,370
defined in the protocol so it turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

488
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,370
that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i put in one pocket as being</font>

489
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:53,850
overwritten that I've got an invalid

490
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:56,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">time stamp but in the other packet I</font>

491
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:59,020
don't however<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be interpreted</font>

492
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:03,910
can be changed

493
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:06,310
the problem with this is is that the

494
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:08,650
poor implementers in this case the IPS

495
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:10,480
industry and it's not often I say the

496
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:14,500
poor implementers of IPs I can assure

497
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:18,130
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey but these guys have to work it</font>

498
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:28,060
out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they fuck up quite a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot really</font>

499
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:29,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">really bad this old versus new issue is</font>

500
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,419
an issue that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still going to get</font>

501
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,450
played out it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen</font>

502
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,350
we're still going to see it do you know

503
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:40,720
who Anne anything maybe wasn't

504
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:43,090
microphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so do you know how many</font>

505
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:47,140
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you raise your hands again everyone</font>

506
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:51,040
I'm making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you've already you've</font>

507
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:55,180
not got your hand<font color="#CCCCCC"> on I told</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you I did</font>

508
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:57,460
warn<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how many of you know nikto the</font>

509
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:02,650
web scanner nikto keep your hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> up if</font>

510
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:06,820
you do but him get that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> counts it's</font>

511
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:11,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so how many of you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard</font>

512
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:16,780
everything called live whisker haha lib

513
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:19,629
whisker live whisker is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> library that</font>

514
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:21,490
does the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDS evasion techniques in nikto</font>

515
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:25,690
how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you knew</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that nikto does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs</font>

516
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:31,330
evasion techniques<font color="#CCCCCC"> as because you've</font>

517
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:33,610
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one of my talks as the believing</font>

518
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:36,490
that that's the love Chris Chris over

519
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:42,280
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christian Riley he really is</font>

520
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:43,900
really awesome so nikto has a lot of

521
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:48,160
ideas evasion techniques that are all

522
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,510
kind of based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this 1996 paper so</font>

523
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,890
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> there a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say to me</font>

524
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:56,110
what am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get IDs evasion</font>

525
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:58,720
techniques nikto like<font color="#E5E5E5"> metasploit a few</font>

526
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,800
other tools are all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they're</font>

527
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,870
all they're all good for that they're

528
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:05,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">all there but all this stuff is really</font>

529
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:07,810
based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a 96 kind of protocol stuff</font>

530
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:09,910
well it<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out we have a solution</font>

531
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:12,220
you've got to love the IPS industry

532
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:16,150
right faced with a problem

533
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:18,130
what they do is get a new product right

534
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:20,230
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to love them if completely</font>

535
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:23,409
fucked up the protocol stop that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

536
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:28,080
we have a new product trademark<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

537
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:31,720
let's talk about protocol normalization

538
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,399
right protocol normalization it's

539
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,909
basically how many of you seen the scene

540
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,590
in an alien's where they basically turn

541
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:40,000
around and say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we should nuke it</font>

542
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,330
from orbit it's the only way to be sure

543
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,909
that ladies<font color="#CCCCCC"> and gentlemen is protocol</font>

544
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:50,770
normalization so how do you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IPS</font>

545
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:53,830
the problem with IPS is is incapable of

546
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:55,840
knowing what<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint is going on what's</font>

547
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,970
happening with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the endpoints right it</font>

548
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't know if the packets being sent</font>

549
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,690
are going to go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a linux box or a</font>

550
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:05,620
windows box so on and so forth it

551
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:09,640
doesn't know that well it can fix that

552
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:11,709
problem by being the endpoint what I'm

553
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:15,640
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to rewrite all</font>

554
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:18,010
the packets and I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to then</font>

555
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,750
analyze the rewritten data stream and

556
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:23,110
then i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send that data stream</font>

557
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:25,690
off to the endpoint so basically it

558
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:29,139
nukes it from order<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is the</font>

559
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:30,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">only way to be sure but ladies and</font>

560
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:33,039
gentlemen we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about industry</font>

561
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:35,950
that fucks up horrific<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee now rewriting</font>

562
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:41,080
packets on your network whoo I feel

563
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:44,700
confident sure you do I went on on site

564
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:48,399
recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wow about a year ago r and r</font>

565
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:51,330
edit an IPS test I love IPS tests that

566
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,830
start with we'd like an IPS test<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

567
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:57,309
what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or we'd like</font>

568
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:59,320
you to test the IPS it granted i get

569
00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:02,168
that but what do you want to get out of

570
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,990
the test we want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test the IPS</font>

571
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:06,970
yeah okay you can stop repeating IPS<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

572
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:13,480
get this but what do you want to know

573
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:16,720
what we don't know well in that case yep

574
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,280
it's an IPS you know what is it that you

575
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">want it's got blinky lights as cool</font>

576
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:24,800
spinous an IPS it's all good

577
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:28,809
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I gon say you know it's gonna be good</font>

578
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:30,800
that started and then secured location

579
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:33,820
I'll not tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the police</font>

580
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:36,649
officer because that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite funny too</font>

581
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:39,379
so I get there you know it's going to be

582
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:42,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">a good test on a secure location when</font>

583
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:45,800
your chaperone says I could do without

584
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:47,540
this today like hey I've just flown in

585
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,550
from fucking Scotland we're doing this

586
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:53,030
ship or you get billed I don't give a

587
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:55,580
shit but either way I'm here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would use</font>

588
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:59,750
me so I'm talking to the guy and I'm

589
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:01,790
saying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> him hey you know when they</font>

590
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:03,200
installed the ipod first off I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

591
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:06,050
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's take me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into your datastore</font>

592
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,510
which one's your IPS and he walks up to

593
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:11,178
the data cabinet pulls the date of

594
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:16,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">cabinet up and he says I think it's that</font>

595
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:19,130
one and I way you think nice cool how

596
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:22,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">did the handover work oh that was really</font>

597
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:24,800
easy like a team came in and they

598
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,450
plugged it instant day<font color="#CCCCCC"> Iraq and then</font>

599
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:30,200
they walked back out again see you pal

600
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:34,400
and that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the installation of a</font>

601
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:36,380
secure location in the UK<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you have</font>

602
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,020
no idea what these people do but trust

603
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:42,080
me you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fucking scared right</font>

604
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:45,650
who have no idea what their ips does

605
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">they say to him cool so I've had a look</font>

606
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:49,160
at your IPS stuff I'm going to tell you

607
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:51,439
some stuff about it but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever have</font>

608
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:56,390
network problems do you ever check the

609
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">logs on the IPS no we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you do</font>

610
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:59,980
understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this thing me writes</font>

611
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:04,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">packets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on your network right does it</font>

612
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:08,210
yeah really yeah really it's in line and

613
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:11,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">it rewrites pockets oh that makes sense</font>

614
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:14,750
now button this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a lot of</font>

615
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but what happens this is the best</font>

616
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,050
thing I spoke to him<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I said to him</font>

617
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,000
why have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got an Ipsy even August so</font>

618
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:22,760
what they wanted to do is they had an

619
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,700
end-to-end encryption thing going on for

620
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,860
a secret<font color="#E5E5E5"> network underneath and I'm like</font>

621
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,390
problem of these IPS is is whether

622
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,490
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> it configured is it's going</font>

623
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do a thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> failed open which</font>

624
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:35,510
means

625
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,580
when it fucks up it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretends it's a</font>

626
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:40,940
Rooter and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't detect anything</font>

627
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:43,210
anymore call me old-fashioned but does

628
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:45,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">that not seem a fact to worth pushing</font>

629
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:50,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">mmm maybe I Satan why have you got an</font>

630
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,200
IPS then if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to fail open</font>

631
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:56,600
before that so the vendor told<font color="#CCCCCC"> us we</font>

632
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:58,158
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh you enter a vendor and said we</font>

633
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buy some stuff what do we need</font>

634
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:04,070
and they went hang on a second let me

635
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:09,830
get the checklist you're now compliant

636
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:13,908
iso standard blah blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah that's</font>

637
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:19,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what's happening how many of</font>

638
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:25,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are pci guys this is going to be fun</font>

639
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:28,520
it's yeah so I at least once a week deal

640
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:32,750
with this situation we don't get any

641
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:35,179
false positives really yeah don't get

642
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:37,039
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> true positives either yeah how do</font>

643
00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:39,049
you know because I'm guessing that

644
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:44,029
you've deployed your IPS between<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

645
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:47,870
encrypted endpoints I deal with this

646
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:53,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">once a week okay at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first it was</font>

647
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:57,580
entertaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> haha yeah now I'm suddenly</font>

648
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:00,320
bitter and twisted and<font color="#E5E5E5"> angry hi so</font>

649
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:04,809
encrypted endpoint encrypted endpoint

650
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:08,480
IPS no ability to decrypt the packets

651
00:33:04,809 --> 00:33:12,408
how does this happen this is where pci

652
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:15,500
comes in<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you required to have a</font>

653
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:17,450
third party application scanner<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

654
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:20,090
required to brit in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

655
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:23,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">allowed to break an SSL tunnel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

656
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:25,158
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want me to scan for bad packets but</font>

657
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:29,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to encrypt the packet so I</font>

658
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:31,909
can't see them yeah whoo win IPS and

659
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:34,490
when pci thanks very much for it but we

660
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:35,870
see this all the time good friend of

661
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:38,290
mine<font color="#CCCCCC"> Andrew Barrett called me up</font>

662
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:40,030
recently dude

663
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:42,840
you're not going to believe what I've

664
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:46,570
just heard fucking how much I was Andrew

665
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:49,600
this is I was in a meeting with some

666
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:51,790
senior network admins and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

667
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,760
some problems with the IPS uh-huh and

668
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:57,570
the senior network admin guy said we

669
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:00,879
should ssl encrypt all the traffic and

670
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:05,460
basically he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was using SSL as a load</font>

671
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:10,179
balancer to take the traffic off the IPS

672
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:12,340
like okay dude I'm gonna I'm gonna put

673
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:14,530
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> out here right think green and turn</font>

674
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:17,340
the fucking thing off because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

675
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:21,730
as it look it's just as effective now

676
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:24,610
right but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> suppose with everything</font>

677
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:27,520
that's going on right now maybe load

678
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:31,810
balancing and open SSL probably are fit

679
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:34,150
for purpose now but uh yeah you know

680
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:39,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's bad but the problem with this</font>

681
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:40,810
encrypted endpoint stuff is it really

682
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:43,960
does want me to hit a motherfucker with

683
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:46,509
another motherfucker right because it's

684
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:52,630
constant once a week I<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this stuff</font>

685
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:55,360
constantly there we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> banks deploying</font>

686
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:57,400
IPS between two encrypted endpoints I am

687
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:01,570
NOT how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you work for a financial</font>

688
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:06,340
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> right you know this shit</font>

689
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:08,590
happens all the time you know why

690
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:11,710
because we don't test jack shit that's

691
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:14,680
why trust but<font color="#CCCCCC"> verify unless it's a</font>

692
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:17,410
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> device then we don't trust but</font>

693
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,830
verify so we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone through the</font>

694
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:23,319
beautiful problems of HTTP and HTML and

695
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:27,910
all of these understood defined

696
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:32,080
protocols RFC motherfucker whoo now

697
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:33,930
let's talk about de facto protocols you

698
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:38,590
know things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not defined in RFC</font>

699
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:41,529
like dce RPC or do we call it MSRP see

700
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:44,080
today or what<font color="#E5E5E5"> other name is it right</font>

701
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:46,990
these protocols are not defined in

702
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:49,390
documents if you don't believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> me ask</font>

703
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:52,120
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> samba team how much fun it is</font>

704
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:56,250
getting network shares on a Linux system

705
00:35:52,120 --> 00:36:00,220
ok how many organizations use SMB

706
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:02,310
religiously this shit is all over

707
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:05,500
corporate network who would have thought

708
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:10,000
corporate<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ville want to share documents</font>

711
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:20,080
made up by Microsoft and your IPS has to

712
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,490
work out what's going on yay how

713
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:28,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">effective do you think we're going to be</font>

714
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:35,220
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm how many of you been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to my talks</font>

715
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:38,439
before ok this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stone soft</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> run so</font>

716
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:41,169
most of you I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I've given one</font>

717
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,510
this year so we'll do it now<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

718
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:46,780
stonesoft scared the shit out of the

719
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:48,970
industry we've got a hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

720
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:53,110
sixty-four advanced evasion techniques

721
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:56,410
the world's<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to an end set the cyber</font>

722
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:59,950
fire alarms off<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok what's an advanced</font>

723
00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:02,589
evasion technique ah well responsible

724
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:05,230
disclosure yeah but what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the details</font>

725
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:06,490
responsible disclosure yeah but what we

726
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:08,530
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know is we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what an</font>

727
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:10,629
advanced it no no no no no no when a

728
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:13,810
responsible disclosure we're not telling

729
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:15,220
anyone ok so we're supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

730
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:20,500
worried about stuff that we don't know

731
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:22,450
about right yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so after a little</font>

732
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,580
while we kind of realized that maybe

733
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:27,970
maybe it was just a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a storm in a</font>

734
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:30,540
teacup moment anyway it turns out it was

735
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:34,180
a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a storm in a teacup moment so</font>

736
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:35,410
two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> later eventually stonesoft</font>

737
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:38,319
decides that's going to release them in

738
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:40,750
some data about it now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

739
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,370
acquired a few pcap files of their

740
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:45,190
advanced evasion techniques and worked

741
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:47,859
out what was going on pretty quickly but

742
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:51,060
apparently what you do is you take a

743
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:54,690
really fucking old evasion technique and

744
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:58,150
an even fucking older evasion technique

745
00:37:54,690 --> 00:38:00,040
you put them together and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

746
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:02,890
brand new advanced evasion technique

747
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:05,110
ladies and gentlemen whoo the internet

748
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:07,900
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fall to pieces</font>

749
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:09,760
so that we're the first to do advanced

750
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,440
evasion techniques yeah you know what we

751
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,660
were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use to evasion techniques</font>

752
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,800
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit since 2006 get over</font>

753
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:19,270
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's done also I'm</font>

754
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,450
guessing you've never read the paper the

755
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:26,740
Achilles heel of detection systems no we

756
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:28,859
haven't well I know you haven't because

757
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:31,870
who would a thought obscuring your

758
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,940
observation is a bit obscure you would

759
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:35,740
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> but who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would have seen that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

760
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:38,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's web applet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eight the web</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> app</font>

761
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,970
testers could tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us how stupid idea is</font>

762
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,420
to keep on putting evasion techniques on

763
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:45,009
top of evasion techniques I was blessed

764
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:48,640
to speak to some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their researchers</font>

765
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:53,260
last year oh that was educational and I

766
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:54,730
said he<font color="#E5E5E5"> said you you you obviously</font>

767
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:57,610
haven't read the Achilles heel of

768
00:38:54,730 --> 00:39:01,360
detection systems right no we have them

769
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:03,100
how do you know because adding evasion

770
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,660
techniques on top of evasion techniques

771
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,940
will increase your detection

772
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,770
capabilities by a factor of six for each

773
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:12,970
evasion technique that you add on<font color="#CCCCCC"> top</font>

774
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:15,220
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I mean that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DCE RPC</font>

775
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:17,799
preprocessors it's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty shit at</font>

776
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:20,500
the moment but<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP segmentation</font>

777
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:23,830
gives the fucking game away who would

778
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:26,140
have thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that by adding different</font>

779
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:31,029
things on that our detection surface

780
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:33,609
would have got bigger yay so it was

781
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:35,440
great because apparently they can detect

782
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:37,630
a hundred percent of advanced evasion

783
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,550
techniques I'm like yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they</font>

784
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:44,470
your advanced evasion techniques of

785
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:47,350
course you can detect your own stuff how

786
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:51,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">can how could a snore well we don't know</font>

787
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:53,140
we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really tried it ah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

788
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:56,710
you buy the default setting in your

789
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:59,859
advanced evasion techniques you use a

790
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:02,170
segmentation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight bytes the</font>

791
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:06,310
preprocessor in snore will fire an alarm

792
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:08,500
for anything less than 128 bytes it's DC

793
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:12,700
erp<font color="#CCCCCC"> C preprocessor is pretty shit at the</font>

794
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:14,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">time so they're DC RPC evasion</font>

795
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,970
techniques would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have sailed through</font>

796
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,308
snore but the fact that it fucked about

797
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:20,558
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP was what set the alarms off</font>

798
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:23,369
by adding evasion techniques on top of

799
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:27,069
evasion techniques obscuring your

800
00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:28,509
observation is obscure seriously but

801
00:40:27,069 --> 00:40:32,799
thank you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you scared</font>

802
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:36,789
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> shit out of everyone but stonesoft</font>

803
00:40:32,799 --> 00:40:39,279
ah the lovely stonesoft recently were

804
00:40:36,789 --> 00:40:46,299
purchased by mcafee for 200 million

805
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:52,390
euros really yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> Intel purchase mcafee</font>

806
00:40:46,299 --> 00:40:56,199
and then McAfee purchase storm soft even

807
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:58,930
John is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fucking crazy you know</font>

808
00:40:56,199 --> 00:41:00,279
I miss John I miss him a lot we need

809
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:01,689
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of characters like that and</font>

810
00:41:00,279 --> 00:41:04,119
security that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call people</font>

811
00:41:01,689 --> 00:41:05,769
out for stuff and maybe blog while

812
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:08,109
you're on the run that's called kind of

813
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:11,529
good as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> now where's my where's my</font>

814
00:41:08,109 --> 00:41:13,180
my bath<font color="#CCCCCC"> salts one of the proudest</font>

815
00:41:11,529 --> 00:41:15,400
moments i had was when<font color="#CCCCCC"> John McAfee</font>

816
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:22,149
followed me on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking</font>

817
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:24,009
love you<font color="#E5E5E5"> man don't shoot me bro so we</font>

818
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:26,140
think you know we think the whole

819
00:41:24,009 --> 00:41:29,619
stonesoft thing whoa 200 million yet

820
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:31,868
remember dead technology yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's</font>

821
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:36,459
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our lovely brothers at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco</font>

822
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:40,449
purchasing<font color="#CCCCCC"> sourcefire for 2.7 billion</font>

823
00:41:36,459 --> 00:41:43,689
dollars that technology remember you

824
00:41:40,449 --> 00:41:48,369
know doesn't detect shit 2.7 billion

825
00:41:43,689 --> 00:41:54,808
dollars eight years previously

826
00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:57,549
checkpoint right to purchase<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sourcefire</font>

827
00:41:54,809 --> 00:41:59,439
225 million dollars at the time which

828
00:41:57,549 --> 00:42:03,969
was still an increase in their stock

829
00:41:59,439 --> 00:42:09,339
price showing that how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you increase</font>

830
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:10,989
your company value by 1110<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent you</font>

831
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:16,869
just be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fucking detection company that</font>

832
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:18,969
sucks<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i did a talking going on in</font>

833
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:20,679
michigan where they're one of the

834
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:22,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">community sponsors if you ever get to</font>

835
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:25,940
America you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> totally go to go con</font>

836
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:29,510
it's a fucking awesome conference so

837
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:34,460
and in the talk and I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> my figures</font>

838
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:36,530
slightly wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hands up I say Cisco</font>

839
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:40,520
purchase<font color="#CCCCCC"> sourcefire for 2.6 billion</font>

840
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:41,690
dollars and the Sourcefire guy gets up

841
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the middle of my talking since I</font>

842
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:46,339
think you'll find<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's 2.7 billion</font>

843
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,710
dollars I don't like oh you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

844
00:42:46,339 --> 00:42:50,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">have so much fun ladies and gentlemen if</font>

848
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:59,420
speak to he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the sponsor</font>

850
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:08,270
not my friend after that but fuck him so

851
00:43:06,069 --> 00:43:10,250
surprisingly from time to time I get

852
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:12,259
asked my opinion about what's happening

853
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,700
in the detection area right who would

854
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,319
have thought it he spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this time</font>

855
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:18,259
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it people want you to know</font>

856
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:21,440
stuff so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get asked about source file</font>

857
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:23,900
hey what what's this<font color="#CCCCCC"> source fighter</font>

858
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">cisco thing going to do for us and I'm</font>

859
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:29,119
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you shouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worry about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it right</font>

860
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,189
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> now you know what snorts probably</font>

861
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,220
dead but that's probably going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

862
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:35,900
five<font color="#E5E5E5"> years cuz</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco don't have a good</font>

863
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,700
reputation where open-source products at

864
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,950
the best of time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only thing</font>

865
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,960
that's worse reputation for them is how

866
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:45,259
fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> they move at doing things they're</font>

867
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:49,160
even fucking slower than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Titanic on</font>

868
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:50,720
a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> day and I say well what you're</font>

869
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,040
probably going to find is that your

870
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,950
source fire products are going to be

871
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:57,770
supported even longer because now<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

872
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:59,060
Cisco products so Cisco is gonna be

873
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:01,420
looking after it so that's all good in

874
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:03,349
the hood is so cool don't worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

875
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:07,790
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the Mark V</font>

876
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:09,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">situation yeah that's pretty fucked but</font>

877
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:10,339
the cisco stuff is pretty cool what

878
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,899
we're probably going to see though is

879
00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:16,910
we're probably going to see snore when

880
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:21,740
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> situation that Oracle</font>

881
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:23,899
did with openoffice we're going to take

882
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:25,640
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring it in I'll</font>

883
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we don't want it set it free to the</font>

884
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,060
community and we're probably going to

885
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:32,660
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with snort we're probably going</font>

886
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:34,250
to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that cut adrift</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but the</font>

887
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,779
rules are going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're</font>

888
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:37,819
probably going to see is more businesses

889
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:40,699
like emerging threats

890
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:42,890
more bespoken rule deals going on that's

891
00:44:40,699 --> 00:44:46,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably what we're going to see I'm</font>

892
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:51,019
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about one of my favorite</font>

893
00:44:46,459 --> 00:44:53,808
favorite stories so I do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of talks</font>

894
00:44:51,019 --> 00:44:55,879
about effective IDs testing we really

895
00:44:53,809 --> 00:44:59,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">suck at science when it comes to IDs</font>

896
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:01,219
testing no definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> a science is</font>

897
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:03,379
something that's really creative<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh well</font>

898
00:45:01,219 --> 00:45:05,709
I can fucking assure you an IPS testing

899
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:08,779
that's the last thing on people's minds

900
00:45:05,709 --> 00:45:12,019
you just get a sacrificial host and a

901
00:45:08,779 --> 00:45:15,079
pen tester and apparently my IPS is

902
00:45:12,019 --> 00:45:18,558
secure or not secure it's like peanut

903
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:20,630
butter and jet engine equal shiny Alex

904
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:23,509
huntin but that's basically what what

905
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:27,469
happens and then you try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and explain to</font>

906
00:45:23,509 --> 00:45:29,089
people that this is not recreate herbal

907
00:45:27,469 --> 00:45:32,119
you're just testing the pen tester

908
00:45:29,089 --> 00:45:34,069
against an IPS device who what do you

909
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:37,579
mean well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean that I can make you</font>

910
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:40,279
more secure overnight by just changing

911
00:45:37,579 --> 00:45:42,619
the pen tester so rather than<font color="#CCCCCC"> having</font>

912
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:44,719
someone with 10 years experience I'm

913
00:45:42,619 --> 00:45:47,599
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> someone on with two</font>

914
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:50,539
months experience and guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're</font>

915
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,849
secure again no problems have been found

916
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:55,519
welcome to<font color="#E5E5E5"> security metrics ladies and</font>

917
00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:57,859
gentlemen now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do is you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

918
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:59,779
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at you go oh shit and</font>

919
00:45:57,859 --> 00:46:07,489
then you have people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at you go</font>

920
00:45:59,779 --> 00:46:08,959
that's an idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

921
00:46:07,489 --> 00:46:10,759
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I talk about is once you</font>

922
00:46:08,959 --> 00:46:13,190
detect something you should always be

923
00:46:10,759 --> 00:46:15,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's not so much</font>

924
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:17,239
to ask that if I pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up once i</font>

925
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:22,099
should be able to pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up a million</font>

926
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:24,259
times so welcome to IPS club or step

927
00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:27,529
back in time there is a product that

928
00:46:24,259 --> 00:46:28,999
buffered a thousand popular threat so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

929
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:30,890
don't know why the chosen thousand was

930
00:46:28,999 --> 00:46:32,509
just a lovely number i think but they

931
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:34,759
chose a thousand threats that they were

932
00:46:32,509 --> 00:46:37,099
going to protect great throughput you

933
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:41,539
know fantastic three per thousand

934
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:44,239
popular threats<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

935
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:47,579
happens when<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new popular threat comes</font>

936
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:51,509
in see them on at the end

937
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:53,789
gone so what you protected against six

938
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:56,299
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago does not necessarily mean</font>

939
00:46:53,789 --> 00:47:01,380
that you're protected against now

940
00:46:56,299 --> 00:47:03,959
amazing throughput though<font color="#CCCCCC"> who it is one</font>

941
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:05,880
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most bizarre concept I mean the</font>

942
00:47:03,959 --> 00:47:10,649
evasion technique against this product

943
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:12,390
is use an old exploit that's it that is

944
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:15,450
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only evasion technique that you need</font>

945
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:23,069
against this product multi-billion

946
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:26,868
dollar industry awesome ah the kill

947
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:30,119
chain how many of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have heard of the</font>

948
00:47:26,869 --> 00:47:32,369
the cyber kill chain believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I was</font>

949
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:34,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">very disappointed to find out the cyber</font>

950
00:47:32,369 --> 00:47:37,349
kill chain was not a chain that killed

951
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:40,440
all the cybers yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was ash</font>

952
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:44,930
motherfucker I why here motherfucker

953
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:47,369
with another motherfucker now right but

954
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:50,879
so how many of you know what the kill

955
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:52,229
chain is<font color="#CCCCCC"> your shoe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna get a run down</font>

956
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,299
your throat over the next couple years

957
00:47:52,229 --> 00:48:00,629
oh my god so I'll keep mine to some work

958
00:47:56,299 --> 00:48:01,709
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> military who woulda thought so</font>

959
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:04,259
the military have a thing called the

960
00:48:01,709 --> 00:48:06,359
kill chain and it is you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to love</font>

961
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:09,569
the way the military name stuff they'll

962
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:11,699
fuck about really do they so what they

963
00:48:09,569 --> 00:48:13,589
realized is when you want to kill<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

964
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:15,869
I'm sorry I mean targets were illegal

965
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:18,719
insurgents right but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

966
00:48:15,869 --> 00:48:21,479
kill those people the certain things

967
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:27,239
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> achieved like I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need a</font>

968
00:48:21,479 --> 00:48:30,359
gun with bullets with a soldier<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

969
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:32,130
area to pull the<font color="#CCCCCC"> trigger and I need to</font>

970
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:35,578
know where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they the target is or the</font>

971
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:37,709
illegal insurgent and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

972
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:40,920
give the<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay order so there's a number</font>

973
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:44,339
of steps that have to be taken to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

974
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,900
this happen and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Americas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

975
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:48,119
American military originally with this

976
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:50,670
one and what the Americans realize

977
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:53,430
pretty quickly was yeah if we don't

978
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:56,249
protect these little links we're not

979
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:58,859
such as an effective kill team and then

980
00:48:56,249 --> 00:49:00,330
what they realized is hey we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't just</font>

981
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:03,390
need to use that for

982
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:07,080
Huck we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for defense right</font>

983
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:08,520
if we stopped because just like we want

984
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,130
to kill them they<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kill us and</font>

985
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:13,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">they they need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get bullets and they</font>

986
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:14,940
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get guns and they need to find</font>

987
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:16,380
those and they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the orders</font>

988
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:19,470
and they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this and if we</font>

989
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:23,520
disrupt parts of that chain who would

990
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:25,379
have thought it lives are saved<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

991
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,300
what did a lot keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> martin do when you</font>

992
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,310
know what that'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really fucking good</font>

993
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:31,800
and detection and what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

994
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:34,860
is if we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have you know that</font>

995
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:36,750

996
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:40,800
people but now we've got a whole acronym

997
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:42,710
for it it turns out that people need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

998
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:47,300
register a command and control center

999
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:50,640
the you need to be profiled targeted

1000
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:53,670
exploited and then payloads and so on an

1001
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:57,089
exfiltration Dada Dada Dada are all of

1002
00:49:53,670 --> 00:50:01,740
these points<font color="#CCCCCC"> are places where we can</font>

1003
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:04,440
detect<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bad Voodoo happening really cool</font>

1004
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:07,470
concept to be firm then we let the

1005
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">marketing people get involved then we</font>

1009
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:19,230
speak to detection people and we like

1010
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:23,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">your don't mention the word again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1011
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:28,560
hurts the problem is is that we really

1012
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:30,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need any more data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok when we've</font>

1013
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:32,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">got we've got enough data we don't need</font>

1014
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:35,460
to find new ways of getting more

1015
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:40,470
metadata or whatever we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already have</font>

1016
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:44,460
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> data ok we can say hey look he's</font>

1017
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:46,230
logged in in our office building he's

1018
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,600
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone through the door key system</font>

1019
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:51,960
and yet he's accessing his email from

1020
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:53,490
China hmm you know we don't need new

1021
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,300
tools for that we already have that log

1022
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:58,850
data we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more log data</font>

1023
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:00,720
well why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need any more log there</font>

1024
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:03,180
what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need a bigger boat</font>

1025
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:06,149
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem if we got any more</font>

1026
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:10,020
data where we can pull date like like

1027
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:11,460
key indicators of what's going on we're

1028
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,880
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need bigger data storage we've</font>

1029
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:15,110
got enough

1030
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,670
so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrap up but I'm going to</font>

1031
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:18,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of a run I know you</font>

1032
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:27,980
feel like you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been running a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> debt but</font>

1033
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:29,480
I had two minds about this I think it's

1034
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:33,070
clear to say that the security industry

1035
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:35,600
in the past couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years is seen</font>

1036
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:37,220
stuff that we never really expected we

1037
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:43,520
were going to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're facing</font>

1038
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:46,459
challenges now<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are biblical lack</font>

1039
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:49,610
of a better term we have mass

1040
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:51,020
surveillance going on we're needed more

1041
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:53,450
now than we've ever been needed before

1042
00:51:51,020 --> 00:52:01,100
and you know what we've done to answer

1043
00:51:53,450 --> 00:52:03,560
that internal fights rather than sitting

1044
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:05,660
down and looking at the problem of we've

1045
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:09,799
just broken ssl how do we make the world

1046
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:13,940
better the heartbleed was an amazing

1047
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:15,350
opportunity for us to help people

1048
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:18,050
understand the issue of password

1049
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:20,240
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> right this shit that we've been</font>

1050
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:22,790
dealing for 30 years and we can't get it

1051
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:25,310
fucking right now we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have password</font>

1052
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:27,200
reset the world and really educate them

1053
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:30,049
about passphrases and you know what we

1054
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:33,710
did as an industry we bickered amongst

1055
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:35,750
each other we argued and gave

1056
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:41,630
contradictory advice and called people

1057
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:44,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">names recently we've had fighting of</font>

1058
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:47,660
calling people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen a tweet calling</font>

1059
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:50,450
people bipolar seen whores and parody

1060
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:52,279
accounts picking on people and yet we're

1061
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:54,410
supposed to be an industry we've got

1062
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:57,020
enough challenges as it is without

1063
00:52:54,410 --> 00:53:00,020
fighting on each other so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to take</font>

1064
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:03,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">this opportunity to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get over our</font>

1065
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:06,350
beef because our enemies are a mile from

1066
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:09,050
victory and we're still arguing and

1067
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:12,620
fighting if we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull out game</font>

1068
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:14,900
together we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be surplus to</font>

1069
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:16,790
requirements there isn't going to be

1070
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:20,270
security because it will have been

1071
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:23,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">engineered out so it's time to stop if</font>

1072
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:25,990
you disagree with a peer don't call them

1073
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:27,880
James just disagree with them we're

1074
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:29,319
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be professional I'm not</font>

1075
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that anyone in this room has done</font>

1076
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:34,440
that but we all know that in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past</font>

1077
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:38,920
couple of weeks this has happened

1078
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:41,170
massively we need to stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because if</font>

1079
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,730
we don't there isn't going to be a

1080
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:44,080
security community by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of it</font>

1081
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:46,930
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to be three-letter</font>

1082
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:50,490
agencies running everything it needs to

1083
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:53,379
stop so if you catch someone being

1084
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:55,450
ridiculously out of order to someone say

1085
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:57,760
something because we need to concentrate

1086
00:53:55,450 --> 00:54:02,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">on security we're needed more now than</font>

1087
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:03,700
ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> before so that is my run I'm sorry</font>

1088
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:06,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it but I thought it was important</font>

1089
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:11,310
to say something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so end the</font>

1090
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:13,450
fighting increase the peace okay so

1091
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:15,250
questions and answers you probably

1092
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:18,879
either got loads of questions or<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1093
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:25,000
get the fuck off the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm cool with</font>

1094
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:26,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">either that refer any questions I so do</font>

1095
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think that this multi-billion dollar</font>

1096
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:32,290
industry exists because marketing people

1097
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,970
are so much better at getting their

1098
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:36,550
ideas across to the end users than we

1099
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:38,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">are as an industry I think what we have</font>

1100
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:40,180
is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue where we still have</font>

1101
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:43,510
companies that will invest money on

1102
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:47,020
metal rather than our own skin<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

1103
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:49,600
if you're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that situation then it's</font>

1104
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:52,090
easy if you're looking for a one box

1105
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:54,220
solution surprisingly there is an

1106
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:55,810
industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for you but</font>

1107
00:54:54,220 --> 00:55:00,100
yes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they deliver their message a</font>

1108
00:54:55,810 --> 00:55:04,600
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than us without doubt any</font>

1109
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:06,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">other questions so rather</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than asking</font>

1110
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:09,190
and I think about any particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor</font>

1111
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:11,350
solution here if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> being in my case</font>

1112
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:13,120
there's an IPS coming in place I'm have

1113
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:15,310
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support the damn thing I get to</font>

1114
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:17,049
influence the project what are the key

1115
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:19,600
sort of messages I should go back with

1116
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:22,540
and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bloody done I should</font>

1117
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:25,779
take away from this talk so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1118
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:28,450
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> what detection means for you ok</font>

1119
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:32,290
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very naive at the beginning to</font>

1120
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:34,660
think that detection was was a

1121
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:36,610
one-size-fits-all problem and the

1122
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,328
problem is is and this came from

1123
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:39,700
detection

1124
00:55:37,329 --> 00:55:41,769
you know what what does men directs

1125
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:44,618
detect well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it doesn't</font>

1126
00:55:41,769 --> 00:55:47,288
actually fucking matter what only

1127
00:55:44,619 --> 00:55:49,599
detection rate matters is your detection

1128
00:55:47,289 --> 00:55:53,049
rate doesn't matter if this vendor is

1129
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:55,690
fucking shit right what matters is this

1130
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:56,890
vendor is good for you and it that you

1131
00:55:55,690 --> 00:56:00,150
need to sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and work out what</font>

1132
00:55:56,890 --> 00:56:02,950
detection means for your organization

1133
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:05,200
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's prevention sometimes its</font>

1134
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:07,779
detection sometimes its compliance all

1135
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:11,140
of those answers are fine but there's no

1136
00:56:07,779 --> 00:56:12,849
point doing a test when the person is

1137
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:14,529
just interested in compliancy and you're

1138
00:56:12,849 --> 00:56:16,719
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at like prevention out of</font>

1139
