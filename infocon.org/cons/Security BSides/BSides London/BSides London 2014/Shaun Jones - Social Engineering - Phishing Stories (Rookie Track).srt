1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,980
alright and so my talks on life stories

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:07,589
from fishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> jobs that we've done the</font>

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,240
last year going<font color="#CCCCCC"> after whispering because</font>

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,240
I've done too many slides but basically

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,740
I've got three stories and hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,089
will know what fishing has or just

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,119
quickly with Reuters get to the good

8
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,039
stuff so I'm first ones about how actual

9
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,779
internet intranets are actually useful

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,529
when you're doing social engineering

11
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:27,990
jobs so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the test was fast cept</font>

12
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,599
ability to phishing attacks and their IT

13
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,850
teams to respond to it and basically it

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,960
was part of a fishing like physical

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,690
breach so basically we were actually

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,430
breaking into offices our plan was to

17
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,530
target their external log interfaces

18
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,750
basically impersonate their extranet

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,400
login page and basically capture creds

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,710
and use those crabs to log into their

21
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">selves EPM and then do the root dance</font>

22
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:53,130
and use it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> onto a actual building</font>

23
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:56,460
and so we cloned their internet page and

24
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:58,740
then we sent a pretty simple email just

25
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,520
g3 essential maintenance you required to

26
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:04,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">log in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with using username creds to our</font>

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,240
domain that closely resembled dares it

28
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,700
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> just had a hyphen on the end</font>

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,310
in between a letter any of you put it

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,110
notes that and we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up get a</font>

31
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,180
lot of creds within like minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

32
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,740
sending the emails some you scratch

33
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,630
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the owa and their selves even</font>

34
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,600
from there we found instructions and the

35
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,550
mailboxes on how to connect to their VPN

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,280
other stuff as well like certain systems

37
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,560
they have butch worth pretty interesting

38
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,130
so from there we connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> VPN found</font>

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">like four scanned for easy common ports</font>

40
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,770
looking for easy routes and then we

41
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:44,820
found ms equal basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> default creds</font>

42
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,500
blank password sa logged in and my

43
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,690
secret service running with<font color="#CCCCCC"> domain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> admin</font>

44
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,540
privileges<font color="#CCCCCC"> i pretty much game over on</font>

45
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,280
thursday and and then from<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

46
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,229
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> nipam and their network and went</font>

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,540
on to<font color="#CCCCCC"> their internet and their internet</font>

48
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,030
was pretty interesting because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

49
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,490
access card<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests you can request</font>

50
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,490
access cards for new<font color="#E5E5E5"> employees or like</font>

51
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:09,929
visitors and stuff up so we made a fake

52
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:12,350
request quest access got cards turned up

53
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,960
on the day how to chat the receptionist

54
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,420
and one problem is you may not upload a

55
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,070
actual picture like you can see there's

56
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,079
the actual attachment thing we didn't

57
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:24,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">realize this so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I end up getting caught</font>

58
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,260
but a colleague of mine basically

59
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:29,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">tailgate at any weight again and then</font>

60
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,429
went about it because it was choir they

61
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,950
had several offices we basically went to

62
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,870
another one did the same thing other

63
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,079
info<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful information on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet</font>

64
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,760
was who their providers were so put on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

65
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,320
red polo t-shirt rock up with red

66
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,820
keyboard I meant I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking fire</font>

67
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,609
extinguishers walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> around checks and</font>

68
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:48,709
numbers are can i plug in to somewhere

69
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,840
just get in access to send some emails a

70
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,220
lot of time people don't care you're on

71
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,340
the network you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do what your high</font>

72
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,990
and so yeah this some pictures was

73
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,560
wondering man who officers actually

74
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:02,960
found an unlocked workstation decided to

75
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,880
plug a keylogger in lock the workstation

76
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,080
walk away come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back in about 20 minutes</font>

77
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,230
someone's logged in left it unlocked

78
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,770
again where we've caught their creds as

79
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,750
well so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was learned from</font>

80
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:17,480
that insurance actually really useful

81
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:22,700
for businesses and attackers cuz they

82
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:24,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">could tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us who physically tells a lot</font>

83
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,899
of information like their policies and

84
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,609
procedures for visitors their badges and

85
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,980
their layouts like this company did

86
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:33,740
security training before and had a whole

87
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,720
slide back on what color lineage people

88
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,640
should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> what types of badge really</font>

89
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful for us we had a printer we just</font>

90
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,290
print stuff off at the hotel<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we were</font>

91
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:45,980
gone building layouts as well their

92
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:48,320
third party providers so basically what

93
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,570
ish do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> two factor authentication on</font>

94
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,430
their external logins as well as using

95
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:54,980
certs rather than usernames and

96
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:57,200
passwords as well because basically you

97
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">can use a lot of login efficient you see</font>

98
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,670
us or after basically by<font color="#CCCCCC"> party and log</font>

99
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,440
yourself in if you capture that two

100
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:07,470
factor auth

101
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,900
so why do we need next one was why you

102
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,500
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to factor off again kind of along</font>

103
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:17,340
there again this physical<font color="#CCCCCC"> reach with</font>

104
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,600
efficient assessment<font color="#E5E5E5"> yada yada yada base</font>

105
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,608
of his time we were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal</font>

106
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,860
courage using owa log into a mailbox

107
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:24,719
send a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice email two receptions and</font>

108
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,280
there's two visitors coming and create

109
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,990
backstory and in gain access to a

110
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:34,260
network again so owa they were running

111
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:38,520
2007 really update so we find that and

112
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:40,050
sent a nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> email with basically new</font>

113
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,150
migration if you don't log in with in

114
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,690
before this state any accounts over two

115
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:47,700
months will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be deleted or disabled and</font>

116
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:51,030
yeah we've got quite a few it's quite

117
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:53,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">useful so then we can't logged into one</font>

118
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,859
of the compromised mail accounts and we

119
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,000
basically sent this email down here and

120
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,919
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it with a colleague of mine</font>

121
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,990
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mithun and when he actually</font>

122
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,830
ripped the emo he was kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough to</font>

123
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:06,930
sign it Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You myth it but the</font>

124
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,820
reception<font color="#E5E5E5"> desk which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an email to</font>

125
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,430
didn't actually pick this up and still

126
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,919
gave us access so next day we've got

127
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,200
fobs and officer badges we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

128
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,900
meeting room and basically logged in

129
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:22,110
within 20 minutes with the main admin we

130
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:25,830
found basically the report for AE AE

131
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,750
found it basically the svn server with

132
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,599
default code so i tried admin password

133
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:35,010
logged in<font color="#CCCCCC"> as i asked a bit odd so tried</font>

134
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:37,380
a rdp<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok local admin and then most find</font>

135
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:39,360
out that our<font color="#E5E5E5"> week service</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

136
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,210
backup service in this one basically was

137
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,930
running so created the main admin number

138
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:48,870
off so that's that one service award we

139
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,150
learn from now looking for contacts like

140
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,560
reception or meeting room stuff like

141
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,729
when you compromise and make out it's

142
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,979
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful because you can actually</font>

143
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:58,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">use those to book a meeting room or book</font>

144
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:02,130
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in rather than emailing an</font>

145
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,710
individual which is helpful and another

146
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:07,440
top tip is if they don't have oh w a

147
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:10,469
accessible you might be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just log</font>

148
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,599
in using the outlooks wizard because

149
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">even though you can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see yo WA you can</font>

150
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:16,240
still probably access outlook that way

151
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:21,160
less using<font color="#E5E5E5"> notes notes</font>

152
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,680
but that takes on storage free so this

153
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,569
one was test users really like set

154
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,800
delete to a phishing attack and but on

155
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:28,690
this occasion we took a white box

156
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,449
approach due to some security measures

157
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:33,520
which client had in place so we full of

158
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">two different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways silk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Reds we did</font>

159
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,039
employee benefit scheme like a fake one

160
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,780
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new owo roll out which at the time</font>

161
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,449
we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize but they're actually</font>

162
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,789
using loucks notes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's quite helpful</font>

163
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:50,259
here and basically wanting to get shells

164
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:51,909
and remote access to the boxes so why

165
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:54,580
was it white box because it's time limit

166
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:56,349
and their number technology was in place

167
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,080
they had they took a white listing

168
00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:01,330
approach to web filtering and had

169
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,758
application whitelisting in her running

170
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,889
on all their like client laptops and

171
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,280
stuff and they also had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a V and a</font>

172
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:11,470
host-based firewall using so forth and a

173
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,750
trend micro's into web scam which was

174
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:16,030
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> TMZ</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if everyone's come across that</font>

175
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,860
before but where's the fun in that you

176
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:21,669
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to bypass all the technology</font>

177
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:25,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">and get to the prep pad that users so we</font>

178
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:28,870
did owa went 2010 this time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font>

179
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:32,590
the same email as we used before still

180
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:34,120
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> just change the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bait and so some</font>

181
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,369
of you victims were actually kind enough

182
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,280
to reply to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us with some screenshots</font>

183
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:42,130
saying they get this untrusted<font color="#E5E5E5"> esto era</font>

184
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,250
oh you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a nice reply it's</font>

185
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,750
fine just just click for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it actually a</font>

186
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,210
majority of people just clip for it

187
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,759
anyway which is quite nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them and</font>

188
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,680
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes people just don't want</font>

189
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring my access so this guy here was</font>

190
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,099
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a waste of</font>

191
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:59,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">time as I don't have a works device to</font>

192
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:00,310
read my emails on so i replied like did

193
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,830

194
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:05,110
logging in and he goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi sure why would</font>

195
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:07,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">i can't check my email work email when</font>

197
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,350
minute I leave site and enjoy my free

198
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:13,289
time

199
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:16,050
I decided no point going on with this

200
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:18,990
guy so<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know sometimes you get</font>

201
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,490
some really<font color="#E5E5E5"> odd questions like this guy</font>

202
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:23,570
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know if you could access it in</font>

203
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:26,640
an internet cafe Iraq like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so odd</font>

204
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you do get other people that</font>

205
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,840
just want access real bad this guy

206
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,669
emailed as a good few times he was like

207
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,059
the link took me to company<font color="#CCCCCC"> website</font>

208
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:38,159
which didn't work which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the whole</font>

209
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,780
point and then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll look into it</font>

210
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,640
i'll get back to you and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was sent me</font>

211
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,250
an email about half an hour later and

212
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you planning on doing this by</font>

213
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:49,650
the way he was head of something so it

214
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,420
was quite important so I was like I've

215
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,790
got several emails of him so we decided

216
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,490
we were going to take a bit fun with

217
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:59,699
this guy so we told him with my access

218
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:01,110
to his machine and we decided we we

219
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,540
jacked up a website it was actually

220
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:06,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">riches idea which is pretty good and to</font>

221
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,829
run basically we had a malicious batch

222
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,590
script that drop the payload for us and

223
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:14,730
then he moaned it didn't work but an

224
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:19,350
actual fact we were had him<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's quite</font>

225
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:22,830
nice no no he didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything and</font>

226
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:24,960
then so one of the ways we were getting

227
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:28,740
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> show on this job was basically we had</font>

228
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,000
a payload of DNS cat and in-house custom

229
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,400
River shows that we've written and

230
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,340
basically we used militia macro to drop

231
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,770
it drop a load and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then basically we got</font>

232
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:41,460
users to enable the macros by doing an

233
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,510
asset register okay and basically we

234
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,310
ripped<font color="#CCCCCC"> my queries in there will</font>

235
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,260
automatically fill in some fields

236
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,569
because everyone's lazy they'll run the

237
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:52,560
macros also it's worth noting we had

238
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:54,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">leeton our phone number as well so we</font>

239
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">send this email out blah blah blah</font>

240
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:59,550
really not interesting but yeah we must

241
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:04,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">get quite a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shells back which quite</font>

242
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:07,859
nice and DNS cat is worth<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioning if</font>

243
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,780
it changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> no so oh yeah one of the</font>

244
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that was a good point on this was</font>

245
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,959
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have valid email</font>

246
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,610
addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and phone numbers on your</font>

247
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">phishing emails and then that way you</font>

248
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,210
can use that to do different attacks

249
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,439
like you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> could mean the</font>

250
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,600
difference between getting some credit

251
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,069
or get in the show because everyone

252
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:29,119
likes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run stuff</font>

253
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:30,439
but you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought so on one of the</font>

254
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:33,079
jobs we didn't actually set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up one of</font>

255
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:34,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">the accounts but you know users was</font>

256
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:37,488
still nice enough to forward on the

257
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:39,199
delivery to play a failure report to us

258
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:40,869
just saying are you can you fold this on

259
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:44,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">short I can't get through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

260
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:47,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> website's not working I didn't</font>

261
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:49,489
realize and basically dinner<font color="#CCCCCC"> shows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

262
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:51,649
not stable in terms of when you're using

263
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:55,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">the actual test leave these like</font>

264
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:58,189
dropping out quite a lot so basically

265
00:10:55,489 --> 00:11:00,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">the white box approaches getting a lot</font>

266
00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:03,199
more beneficial for the test fishing

267
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:05,449
test because it it saves a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time</font>

268
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:07,368
and playing around figuring out what

269
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:09,229
payloads are going to work and how to

270
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:11,899
bypass stuff it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

271
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:14,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing it and benefit of writing your own</font>

272
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:16,639
custom shells and of course imagination

273
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:17,989
when you're doing it is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

274
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,959
best way of bypassing stuff like

275
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:24,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">allocation whitelisting and white list</font>

276
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:29,479
of web apps as well which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is good and</font>

277
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:33,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's it cool I don't they Oh got mean</font>

278
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:38,110
I left any questions what about ideas

279
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:41,179
once we've worked so what what one sorry

280
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:44,779
this was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> food world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh what them</font>

281
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:47,059
responding to us yeah with and service

282
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:49,339
area when we do fishing jobs we've

283
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:52,219
normally get it so their IT team will

284
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:54,619
know about it or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> member of their IT</font>

285
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,589
team will know about it and basically on

286
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:59,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first story the when they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> realize</font>

287
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:02,689
what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> by that time we already</font>

288
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:04,220
found the week Nico and stuff they

289
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:06,679
decided they were going to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

290
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,869
shutting down the VPN and because it's

291
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:10,549
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> commercial company the IT manager</font>

292
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:12,169

312
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:06,860
you mostly using owa s the example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we</font>

313
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,360

314
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,190
to just work a lot because everyone

315
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,370
knows about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like knows what it is</font>

320
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:36,589
then basically use two-factor off with a

321
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,959
sir and basically do it through that way

322
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:40,430
because you're basically allowing access

323
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,849
to your network through like controlled

324
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:45,859

basically their internal count policy

327
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:52,190
didn't lock accounts so you can just

328
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,620
brute force people's passwords and get

329
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:57,260
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a double yet easily so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do is</font>
