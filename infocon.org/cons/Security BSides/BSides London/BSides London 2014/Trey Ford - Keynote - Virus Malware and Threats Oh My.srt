55
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,649
in the early<font color="#CCCCCC"> days we looked at the</font>

we saw dos and windows viruses 2000 was

76
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,700
fun because through the 2000s we saw all

78
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:24,569
my doom in that time zone we went from

79
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:26,280
where we were cleaning up viruses how

80
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:29,458
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you guys can like to just rattle</font>

off all the the registry key hives you

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,280
need to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through and clean out when</font>

83
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:34,560
you're manually removing a virus like

84
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,790
this was old school like not old school

85

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm young old school for me that all</font>

86
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,260
changed with Code Red Nimbus a sir this

87
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,090
is where the notion of we can't clean<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

88
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,250
to get to a trusted computing base

89
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,379
things changed a little bit so we went

90
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the nuke and pave timeline but</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we're still trying to help people</font>

107
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,710
this isn't about blocking things out

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't just about hygiene a</font>

infrastructure is resilient enough to

114
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:58,570
prevent it so the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> becomes what</font>

115
00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:00,449
do we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that so the classic</font>

116
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,740
discussion is knowing your opponent I

117
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:12,220
think we're all somewhat aware of these

118
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:15,120
guys have to choose to the ice cubes

119
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,169
it's like the rudest thing I could do

120
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,490
we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dbi</font>

that we should all spend time studying I

124
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,750
think there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of relevant wisdom I</font>

125
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,599
think there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of data that helps</font>

129
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,949
is the first data point we have or we

130
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:40,210
can actually reference this where we can

131
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:43,270
actually look across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry and</font>

132
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:46,479
look at the largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> coalesced incident</font>

133
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,889
report and kind of share here's common

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,919
threads here's common points of failure

135

hears things that we know people are

136
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:54,549
blowing it on so what I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to do</font>

00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:57,130
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some energy talking a little</font>

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:03,490
we compare ourselves a little bit and

140
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,620
how we're different<font color="#CCCCCC"> our opportunities so</font>

141
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,930
criminal economics I think we're all

<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to shift in our</font>

433
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:50,429
second we as a community I think have a

434
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:53,280
myopic focus on the technical why do you

435
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:54,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's not something we set</font>

436
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,230
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do I don't think we all aspire to</font>

00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:00,750
be Dilbert is Dilbert international do

438
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:08,010
you guys do Dilbert over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I</font>

439
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:09,270
don't ever know it's easier it's more

440
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:13,400
constrained we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly what's gonna</font>

441
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:16,110
happen I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a very good unix admin I</font>

442
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,890
came up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows did a lot with novell</font>

443
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:21,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">nivelle apparently has some unix roots</font>

444
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,039
but what I found in managing systems is

445
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,049
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked it to do a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font>

446
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:30,570
with the constrained bit Martin's dead

447
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:33,658
on when I asked a system to do something

448
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,700
I provide a script an installer a<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPO</font>

449
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:37,380
there's a fairly structured amount of

450
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,990
behavior that I expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come back out</font>

451
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that right how many of you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

452
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,309
made the jump from the technical track

453
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,870
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> management track and I want</font>

454
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:47,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">things successfully but you're you're in</font>

455
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">the batting cage swing it at it a</font>

456
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:52,139
handful and those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> lohan's there's a</font>

457
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:54,209
lot of them though all right I like

458
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,700
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it is constrained I</font>

459
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,740
do have a measure of expectation but

460
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,620
what's interesting about this is I spent

461
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,160
my entire life

462
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:06,580
firing to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I studied my maths that's</font>

463
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:09,309
how they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it here right Matt's I did</font>

464
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,750
a lot of science I took a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of I don't</font>

465
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:12,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I didn't take a lot of programming</font>

466
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,110
as much as networking and systems

467
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:16,389
management but I studied this forever I

468
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:19,870
banged my head on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hard table forever</font>

469
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:21,370
I've broken my share of keyboards I've

470
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,139
always been working<font color="#CCCCCC"> this I'm always</font>

471
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,309
reading new materials studying the

472
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,559
latest technology stuff that's coming

473
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:28,780
out we all do this we do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> nights and</font>

474
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,149
weekends but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

475
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,230
aspirational thing and because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

476
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:36,429
something we've spent so much energy

477
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:40,150
pursuing I think we elevate that now

478
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:45,280
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we make this jump over to to</font>

479
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:48,580
management historically in infosec we've

480
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,309
not really respected so greatly our

481
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,928
management counterparts there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

482
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:54,550
csos out there there's a lot of middle

00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:57,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">management out there I think they get a</font>

484
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:59,350
pretty bad rap<font color="#CCCCCC"> man my manager just not</font>

485
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,389
very techincal I don't doesn't

486
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:03,280
understand what we do why were<font color="#E5E5E5"> you in</font>

00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,960
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> office so late Oh what was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it like</font>

488

golfing buddy I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we're trying</font>

489
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,820
to fix stuff it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't</font>

490
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,350
understand this right now in this moment

491
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,290
in this chapter of<font color="#E5E5E5"> history I think we're</font>

492
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:17,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a really deep place because we're</font>

493
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:20,379
seeing more and more executives more and

494
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,840
more senior management in infosec and IT

495
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,809
that have moved over made the jump from

496
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,000
technical contributors to management

497
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:29,920
these people understand us they've

498
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,800
fought our battles they've bled in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

499
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:35,950
same dirt they've had pager duty and

00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,928
they know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is I had a manager</font>

501
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,820
when I was an IR come back in at three

502
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:41,860
in the morning he personally didn't

503
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,129
dispatch his admin he actually brought

504
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,330
us coffee showed up brought us coffee

505
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,130
brought us some warm food and left

506
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,449
literally came by once you guys know I

507
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,580
appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I know what you're going</font>

508
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,950
through who's at home sleep in and what

509
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,210
time of the yep look I'll check on<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

510
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:58,330
that that's means leadership that was

511
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:01,600
amazing middle management technical

512
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:04,020
management they get a bad rap how many

513
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:08,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have said the following</font>

that's crap that's crap

middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> management brought you something</font>

00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,680
sit on the Executive Board they don't

518
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,180
know it doesn't go from<font color="#CCCCCC"> god of the CEO</font>

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,199
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all too often and I'm sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

522

face this as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well they've come to you</font>

523
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,940
with something a directive decision that

524
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:31,450
we don't agree with and of course being

525
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:36,770
the strong<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec type we let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

526
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:40,780
we laid<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out because clearly I don't</font>

527
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:43,750
get it we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that age anymore</font>

528
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:47,389
what I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we lose sight of is that</font>

529
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:48,950
these managers they listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us they</font>

530
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,080
care force they support us many of them

531
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,450
have walked a mile in our shoes maybe

532
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,100
five miles in our shoes I mean come on

533
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys we're in the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> generation most</font>

534
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,610
of us are standing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shoulders of</font>

535
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,889
giants some of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> Giants are in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact</font>

536
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:04,040
our managers and we lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> sight of the</font>

537
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,180
fact that these managers are bloody on

538
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,200
the side that we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

539
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,510
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they went to management they</font>

540
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,230
fought the fight and they gave every

541
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:14,930
argument we just gave and more are we

542
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,490
guilty of that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> guilty that I don't</font>

543
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,650
want to be guilty<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad but I am I have to</font>

544
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:21,440
eat my dog food on this and so there

545
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:22,880
have been times I did this in I are of

546
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,700
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> IRS kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of emotional and when</font>

547
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:29,420
you're sleep deprived your extra stupid

Club<font color="#CCCCCC"> monta doesn't help that at black</font>

549
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,230
hat I did it but this is interesting

550
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:35,720
right because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose sight that we've</font>

551
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:37,520
worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> so hard to educate our managers</font>

552
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,620
and our counterparts<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they lose</font>

553
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,690
track they don't know what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

554
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,729
they've fought the battle for us and

555
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,990
it's our job to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help educate them on hey</font>

556
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,070
making sure that you're articulating the

557
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,390
arguments correctly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there did you</font>

558
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember all these other points and</font>

559
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:51,230
sometimes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have to take it you</font>

560
00:22:49,460 --> 00:23:00,680
pick your battles and that's their job

561
00:22:51,230 --> 00:23:03,260
not ours oh dear imposter syndrome who

562
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:06,340
here has imposter syndrome don't reach

563
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,340
your hand I guess we all should

Marty I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> your sitting in the front</font>

00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:15,320
the first stranger and you probably only

567
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,240
some germs interesting because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

568
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:23,270
with our pursuit of technical knowledge

569
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,150
technical mastery we achieve a certain

570
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:30,920
level of I clearly don't know enough is

653
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:54,370
we walk into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a meeting fired up because</font>

654
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:57,220
we've done the homework people often

655
00:26:54,370 --> 00:27:01,870
misunderstand us because we're cocky<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

656
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:05,649
smart I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't necessarily</font>

map to the best the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> traditions the</font>

honor that is the community the

00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,090
shoulders that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we stand on the Giants</font>

660
00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:13,209
that have held us and coached us and

661
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:15,580
support us and lifted us up I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

662
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:17,649
we're often miscast because we speak

663
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,990
from a place of conviction it's actually

664
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:22,539
humility and passion we stayed<font color="#CCCCCC"> up all</font>

665
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:26,679
night we read the rfcs we banged on

666
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:29,640
until we got there and I think we're

667
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:29,640
often misunderstood

668
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,679
so what separates the bad guys the

669
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:37,539
hackers<font color="#CCCCCC"> the criminals from the good guys</font>

670
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,850
it's not the relentless pursuit of

671
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:42,809
accuracy relentless pursuit of actually

672
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:45,009
popping a shell success in an attack

673
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:47,139
even necessarily even success in our

674
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:48,610
business objective which by the way

675
00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:55,090
isn't necessarily breaking the damn

me not a mark on the face the criminals

680
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:06,489
are in it to cash in they have a

681
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,980
singular objective a singular focus

682
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:10,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what makes them successful</font>

689
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:26,919
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not us the thing is when I</font>

690
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:29,950
think of infosec when I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

691
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:31,869
community that has been so warm and kind

trip as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCI auditor story to you guys</font>

695
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,249
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that I've got the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guts to</font>

696
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,649
do it that's probably for another time

697
00:28:39,249 --> 00:28:44,740
but when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of information security</font>

698
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:48,100
I think of a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> more like this what</font>

699
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:50,679
is her name Meghan Vogel winning the

700
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:54,998
argument drop in science that's not

701
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:58,149
success Meghan Vogel is a track athlete

702
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:59,679
believe this was in high school she's

703
00:28:58,149 --> 00:29:02,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">run in a race she's not doing so great</font>

704
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,149
the gal that was in the lead drop she

705
00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:05,499
collapsed she overcooked it I think we

706
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:08,439
all come out of the gates a little hot

707
00:29:05,499 --> 00:29:09,909
sometimes I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,779
to running I hate running I still hate

709
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:16,090
it so Megan's coming towards the last

710
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:18,059
round and you know rounding towards the

711
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:20,529
finish line towards that last straight

712

classes worked in public speaking even

896
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:43,160
it's something silly I started take an

little differently what's very strange

911
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:18,710
thought if you're explaining you're

912
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:21,049
losing communication is what the

listener walks away with has nothing to

915
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:28,370
do with you has nothing to do with how

00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:30,500
you did or what you covered the meeting

917
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:33,710
is literally about getting them to walk

00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:52,618
this probably flies in the face of agile

all believe this on some level but we

1141

have to articulate this clearly at any
