1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
oops why information security should be

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,670
important to us all but first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give you a bit of my background I</font>

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:15,240
started off as an accountant I'm not in

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:18,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong place I then I'm worked in</font>

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,340
auditing for a while I then moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,980
computing I did my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hardware did my</font>

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,109
software did my operational sysadmin did

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,080
my sis admin and finally I went into

10
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,480
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> security and I did my MSC</font>

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,199
Royal Holloway which I past many years

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a certified unix engineer</font>

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,180
started off in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Solaris and red hat back</font>

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,710
in the day when<font color="#E5E5E5"> stellaris world and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,879
started my own information security

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,530
company which im COO so why is

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,419
information security or why should

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,469
information security be important to us

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:55,820
all I love this quote and most people

20
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:59,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> realize about their digital data</font>

21
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:02,219
it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to other people there's a</font>

22
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">value on it most people walk around with</font>

23
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,470
their phones or they give out the phone

24
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,740
numbers online or they in information

25
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,890
easily because they don't realize that

26
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:15,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">information warfare has already begun</font>

27
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,430
and if you try to talk to someone about

28
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,439
this you get that glaze I don't know if

29
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,909
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had it but when I sit put my</font>

30
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">girlfriends down and try to talk to him</font>

31
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,590
about computing and information security

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,270
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like that and that's</font>

33
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,610
because for them it doesn't really

34
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,979
matter until it affects them until their

35
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,579
child their bank account their life has

36
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:37,560
been compromised so the aim of this talk

37
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,949
is to show you why information security

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,040
should be important to us all I will

39
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,619
identify the threat paradox I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

40
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to identify ramification of poorly</font>

41
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:53,670
implemented security policy finally I'll

42
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,408
suggest some solutions now if you've

43
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,420
been to<font color="#CCCCCC"> university we've read a computer</font>

44
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,369
book information<font color="#CCCCCC"> security book it always</font>

45
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,799
starts with the CIA confidentiality

46
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:04,140
integrity<font color="#E5E5E5"> availability we all know that</font>

47
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,939
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> franchina we can tell you what</font>

48
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,818
cipher text is the best which one's your

49
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:11,079
favorite blah blah blah some of us can

50
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:15,209
even do Euclidean algorithm by hand

51
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:18,280
and then you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the integrity you know</font>

52
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,840
some people understand you know we have

53
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,180
our favorite forms of integrity<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,400
availability that's how we talk about

55
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">information security but try talking to</font>

56
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,200
the average<font color="#E5E5E5"> person's anyone about</font>

57
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">information security in this way and</font>

58
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,440
once again they're gone they glaze over

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,870
because to the real world information

60
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,609
security is about the state it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

61
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,490
the individual it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the enterprise</font>

62
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:45,640
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how it affects them and they</font>

63
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:48,730
see it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> respect to their threat</font>

64
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,140
paradox how does it affect them what are

65
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">they trying to protect themselves from</font>

66
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,989
and if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to normal people</font>

67
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:58,060
about information<font color="#E5E5E5"> security you need to</font>

68
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,459
leave the university in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the books behind</font>

69
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:04,420
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to talk to how it impacts</font>

70
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:06,820
their lives opposite to the state

71
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,500
information security is about trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

72
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,420
hear the chatter they need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

73
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,790
what's going on they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really care</font>

74
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:16,059
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and me they care about society</font>

75
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:17,650
as a whole i'm going to say heartbleed a

76
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,570
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks ago didn't if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

77
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was this exploit going around</font>

78
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:25,390
heartbleed um and I heard and I'm not

79
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:28,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure this is true that the NSA had been</font>

80
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,130
aware of the heartbleed exploit two

81
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,500
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their chose to kind of say</font>

82
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:35,200
nothing because it was good for them

83
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,170
more chatter and you cannot kind of

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,310
understand why they do that because

85
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,859
they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find out when the next</font>

86
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,810

87
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,450

doing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they leave are susceptible to</font>

89
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,339

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,280
paradox<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good for them it's not</font>

91
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:58,390
necessarily good for us and you've got

92
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:01,180
the corporate the enterpriser most

93
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,190
people when they start a business apart

94
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,360
from me don't start the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

95
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,510
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be really good information</font>

security they start the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,310
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make money they didn't care</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> information security they'll get</font>

99
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:18,690
iso 27001 or two just to say they've got

100
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:21,820
it a tick-box exercise

101
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:25,090
what they want is to make money they'll

102
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:27,520
get the health and safety a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tick box</font>

103
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,049
they'll pay that a tick box but they

104
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,760
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do any of that they</font>

105
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,680
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make money and therefore they</font>

106
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,000
will compromise all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font>

particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> they will compromise</font>

information security just to make money

00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">and by compromising their information</font>

110
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,440
security they're compromising all of our

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,530
information security and then you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:51,120
the individual information security for

them generally not always does not exist

if their identity it's their life and

119
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,620
it's so easily compromised you've got

maybe they do now but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you collect</font>

136
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,150
understood what a secure socket layer

vast and they're so badly equipped to

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:15,460
their problem because when it goes wrong

146
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:17,948
it really is their problem because there

147
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,680
is nobody there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've got all these</font>

148
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:22,690
different bodies who are seemingly

149
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,300
working and doing information security

150
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:31,510
in our society you've got the mo<font color="#E5E5E5"> d</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GCHQ</font>

151
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,080
all of them are there a flat line system

152
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,159
but

153
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,229
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> something goes wrong when your</font>

154
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:37,780
child is subjected to cyberbullying I

155
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:39,370
don't know when you are being cyber

156
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,919
stores which one of these groups is

157
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:47,439
going to be there to help you no one

158
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:51,210
because it's your problem so what's the

159
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:54,340
solution well the first solution is

160
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,198
within a security environment there

161
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,938
should always be one single point of

162
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,509
contact and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have that this</font>

163
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:03,699
moment if I was attacked and I rang the

164
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:06,580
police would I need to identify what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

165
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:09,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">sexually physical or racial no I would</font>

166
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:12,099
not I would ring 999 and they would be

167
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:16,479
there in information security we don't

168
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:18,190
have that also another solution is

169
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,659
people should be qualified i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you an example i went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a really</font>

high power of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dinner and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

172
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,849
sitting at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the table of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a guy who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

173
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,000
charge of information security for one

174
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:33,188
of the major utilities and I'm kind of

175
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,509
into cybertek's and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> cypher to</font>

176
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:35,860
excuse me so I started to talk about

177
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:38,259
psycho text and he didn't know what it

178
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:41,289
was so I to break it down right explain

179
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:42,909
what s key was to start with c1 going

180
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:45,639
he's in charge of information security

181
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:47,860
for utilities then when I got a ski I to

182
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,199
explain how to transfer base 10 two bass

183
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:54,129
two yeah I didn't know what phase<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

184
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:56,199
was then I tried to explain my favorite

185
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:58,690
algorithm which is you cleared him he

186
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,639
was lost I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thought to myself at</font>

187
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,719
that point if if you mention hash<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac to</font>

188
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,400
that guy you probably think you're

189
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:06,789
talking about raincoat he does not

190
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,799
understand and that's the problem in our

191
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:10,449
industry unlike any other profession

192
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,610
anyone can claim to understand

193
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:15,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">information security and be promoted up</font>

194
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:17,589
through the ranks and that's

195
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:19,930
unacceptable if you want to be in charge

196
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:22,330
of an accountancy or an account group

197
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,770
you need to be an accountant if you want

198
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,900
to be in charge of information security

199
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,599
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be qualified our</font>

200
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,239

00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:33,939

202
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,409
ourselves become qualified because we're

203
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,959
the ones with a community with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

204
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:40,208
knowledge with the lab but we don't get

00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:42,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">qualified then we leave it to those that</font>

206
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:47,430
created a system we have

and officer gates sugary of the world

208
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:54,339
fundamentally because we have the

209
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,480
knowledge we need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> there I don't</font>

know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I dash through this really</font>

211
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:02,590
quickly I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have so what's the</font>

212
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,080
conclusion for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conclusion is</font>

213
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:07,180
quite simple the<font color="#CCCCCC"> state</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to</font>

214
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,420
understand the individual is important

we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a correct structure of first</font>

216

point of contact when your child is

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,980
being bullied when you have been cyber

218
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:20,140
stalk someone need to take that series

219
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:26,100
not just you but everyone there should

220
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:28,600
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of contact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the individual I i</font>

221
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,910
heard i went to talk earlier one about

222
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,180
crypto parties they sound great my sort

223
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:36,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">of party cryptography and party and and</font>

224
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:38,530
we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do more of that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

225
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,260

wine and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ciphertext it works we need to</font>

227
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,860
bring people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fold people need to</font>

228
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,200
understand but they are responsible

229
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,230
because when it goes wrong they're the

230
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,730
only one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> themselves and</font>

231
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:55,780
enterprise my past career was a as an

232
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,850
accountant so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand the profit</font>

233
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,170
motive but the enterprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise to</font>

234
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,350
need to understand the bottom line

235
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:05,439
presently only six percent of GDP is

236
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:07,270
being achieved on the internet but

237
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,760
that's an exponential number and it will

238
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:11,290
increase so 250 billion pounds has been

239
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,330
made on the internet but has that

240
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:16,300
increases enterprises will understand

241
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:19,090
that will be an equal increase in cyber

242
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,310
attacks in cyber fraud and if they don't

243
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their act together now in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> future you</font>

244
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,750
may find enterprises company spell not

245
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:28,660
because of their product but because of

246
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:30,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">their lousy information systems and we</font>

247
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,350
as a community need to walk away from

248
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,819
companies who don't implement the

249
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,370
correct passwords where they want

250
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,930
character in a number of sorry an alpha

251
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,850
and the number but they won't use all

252
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,260
the character sets we need to walk away

253
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,270
from companies like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this because they're</font>

254
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:46,200
compromising our industry and are

255
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,199
compromising us all

256
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,040
the same I mean at<font color="#E5E5E5"> university love to</font>

257
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,290
say this because if one of us bail be

258
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,599
industry beat the government be

259
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:01,990
individual fail in information security

260
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:05,350
world we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all fail so we have to work</font>

261
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,330
together so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to conclude with</font>

262
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,980
my favorite quote I read a book by

263
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,630
Dorothy down in it was about eight or

264
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,160
nine<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I just got into</font>

265
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,410
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> security and I read her book</font>

266
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,000
it was was part of my cause and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

267
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought she was totally wax I didn't get</font>

268
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,170
her I really didn't know where she was

269
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,820
coming from but as I've kind of gone

270
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,370
along and gone along I realized she was

271
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,990
a visionary because this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way we</font>

272
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:28,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">are living what we are subjected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

273
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:31,720
every day so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> should information</font>

274
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:35,870
security be important to us all because

275
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:44,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">information warfare has already begun</font>

276
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:47,230
thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> listening any person no</font>

277
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,230
bye
