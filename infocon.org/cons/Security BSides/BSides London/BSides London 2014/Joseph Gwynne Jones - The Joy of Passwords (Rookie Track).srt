00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:12,900
hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name is Joseph Quinn</font>

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:15,900
Jones I'm studying at Leeds Met and I'm

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,630
doing IT forensics and security today

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,519
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about passwords I'm</font>

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,619
sure you've all it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the news</font>

6
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,779
recently about passwords been stolen

7
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:29,550
from big corporate companies like Adobe

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:31,500
Tesco etc and the is a good example in

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,809
two thousand name there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company</font>

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,190
rock you and there's loads and loads of

11
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,199
passwords and these are clear examples

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,530
of when when it's gone wrong so I'm

13
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:45,568
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that right then bear</font>

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:48,089
with me obviously there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

15
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:50,100
passwords have been analyzed and lots of

16
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:53,549
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the same password regardless</font>

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,679
of usernames so from 2012 there was

18
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:57,839
passwords like on the screen these are

19
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,699
real genuine like I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> you dragon</font>

20
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:02,638
monkeys all of those are actually

21
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,440
genuine passwords and the lists<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

22
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:07,640
change you know over time<font color="#E5E5E5"> people use the</font>

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,640
same static passwords

24
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,790
and this is why password lists are

25
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,980
useful because we need to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

26
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,980
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how information is stored</font>

27
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:27,290
so to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords even more secure</font>

28
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:29,690
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be salted and and then they</font>

29
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,120
hashed as well so they basically

30
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:35,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">increased the security and the fluidity</font>

31
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the passwords and make them more safe</font>

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,330
so they use various different characters

33
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:45,979
and numerical fields within them so when

34
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">you log in with your account name when</font>

35
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:50,630
it's salted<font color="#E5E5E5"> it becomes hashed as well</font>

36
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,520
and the hash has to be matched through

37
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,880
the password security system to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

38
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,340
let you go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your into your account</font>

39
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,920
regardless of where it is unfortunately

40
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,170
some big company I'm talking you know

41
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,330
billion turnover companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use</font>

42
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,580
clear text passwords that are insulted

43
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:10,130
that aren't hashed so that's really

44
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,109
really bad plain text it's very easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

45
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:16,910
get into and to access and to be

46
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:20,750
compromised and password lists are

47
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:22,940
useful for cracking so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

48
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:26,120
works in the way we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> your password</font>

49
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,489
list so there could be password<font color="#CCCCCC"> 121</font>

50
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,320
they'll try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and see if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hashed and</font>

51
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:33,560
then they moved into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next work next</font>

52
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,959
password 122 and so on in sequential

53
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,549
order and then once the hashed is

54
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:40,160
matched then it's cracked that's how it

55
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:43,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">works the password list make things</font>

56
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,200
quicker which means the password cracker

57
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,150
will try and<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through them in</font>

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,780
sequential order and to match them to

59
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:52,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">the accounts</font>

60
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:55,780
and you know crack passwords we need to

61
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:58,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at what these are useful for me we</font>

62
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,230
all have accounts you know a variety of

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,560
ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> HSBC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> facebook twitter</font>

64
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:08,738
<font color="#CCCCCC">halifax various banks adobe all those</font>

65
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:12,069
kind of places you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know myself I've got</font>

66
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:14,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">over a hundred accounts and the biggest</font>

67
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:20,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem is people use the same password</font>

68
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:23,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">for all of their accounts online so it</font>

69
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,940
due to security reasons once you've got

70
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,488
the password<font color="#E5E5E5"> for one then you can</font>

71
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:31,150
basically access all different passwords

72
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:35,800
as well so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of Heather</font>

73
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:38,140
system works for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example adobe software</font>

74
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,630
they could have the the email which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

75
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:44,708
linked to a password and they'll try

76
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:46,720
that basically once and once once I've

77
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,310
secured one person's password for one

78
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,080
website they can use it then to repeat

79
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,660
it on other well-known famous sites and

80
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,019
basically make a pass make a profit from

81
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,180
that this has been stretched and 44 my

82
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:59,829
original presentation basically we all

83
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,980
know this theory but don't use the same

84
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:04,360
password twice I am guilty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing this</font>

85
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:08,649
myself a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but we all know</font>

86
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,510
not teach the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> password twice so I'm</font>

87
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">ranjan you know who just used strong</font>

88
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,590
powerful passwords<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mum use</font>

89
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,418
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is its tune some security</font>

90
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,600
courses only that use powerful strong

91
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:21,548
passwords I'm not sure because it

92
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,200
University myself recently and the

93
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:27,239
teachers gave us a challenge where we

94
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:30,729
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> break into other students images</font>

95
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,669
so and I basically use that through a

96
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:35,380
remote<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to their network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

97
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:37,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">I put in a key locker onto their</font>

98
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,520
computers and it collected all the keys

99
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,080
that have been pressed and that's

100
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,729
basically all got their passwords for

101
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:48,400
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> login I won that competition and you</font>

102
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:50,650
know but obviously this could have

103
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,849
carried and I could have you know I knew

104
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,549
all their personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> information like</font>

105
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,169
Gmail and Yahoo and all that but I

106
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,310
basically advised them that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

107
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:59,260
weakness and this is what needed to

108
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,380
happen so that the situation is very

109
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,490
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get in and it's for me that was</font>

110
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,469
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> specifically</font>

111
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,289
university that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quite terrible and</font>

112
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:13,569
a bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> an example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of how easy things</font>

113
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:16,750
can be accessed a password manager

114
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:20,849
system is one way myself I use LastPass

115
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,849
it's up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you what you use really</font>

116
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,759
password will help password managers

117
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,090
help you have loads and loads of

118
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:32,740
passwords and they'll keep a list for

119
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:34,539
different accounts and and you know if

120
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,770
example if you were to be compromised on

121
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:38,380
one account it would just be that one

122
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,580
again that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be affected</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as opposed</font>

123
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:43,210
to all of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they're all</font>

124
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:46,780
randomly selected and also there's

125
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,039
additional security measures like no I'm

126
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,979
sure everyone in this room has a

127
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:54,219
smartphone with them at the moment you

128
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:58,030
can download this app called the the

129
00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:02,280
author app or there's the UB comb which

130
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:04,690
is a USB key and when you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

131
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,690
creates a random number which isn't

132
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:10,409
repeated it's changed all the time so

133
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:13,210
that means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font>

134
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:14,770
secured more safely or someone want to

135
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,270
try and break into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it doesn't</font>

136
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,250
obviously match and synchronize with the

137
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,549
numbers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other devices so there is</font>

138
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:24,159
alternate ways of looking at protection

139
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">in terms of passwords talking about</font>

140
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:27,699
password money password management

141
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:29,949
you're thinking okay so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if someone's</font>

142
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:33,610
broken into my password manager you know

143
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:34,659
I'm done for you know so you may look at

144
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,849
this and think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a beautiful</font>

145
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:41,169
password it got characters capitals

146
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:44,250
small case spaces numbers and all those

147
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:46,990
symbols as well but actually it's not

148
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:49,719
you know password<font color="#E5E5E5"> crackers a really</font>

149
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:53,650
effective and their use specific sites

150
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:55,630
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wikipedia and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll look for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

151
00:06:53,650 --> 00:07:00,159
look for keywords key phrases key

152
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:01,719
expressions and and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually able</font>

153
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:04,469
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> break</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that password because it's</font>

154
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:06,520
actually used and referred to on

155
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:08,080
Wikipedia I mean you look at it anything

156
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh that's an amazing password no one</font>

157
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,349
ever break that but that's actually

158
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,700
stored somewhere as a phrase on the

159
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:18,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet as stated on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen</font>

160
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:20,240
a possible idea is to sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was done</font>

161
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,310
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> keynotes but this is no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerPoint so</font>

162
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,270
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a skew whiff this is</font>

163
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:28,430
dice where it should say on the screen

164
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:30,530
you know it's basically a software that

165
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,940
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of treats things like the roll of a</font>

166
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:35,510
dice in terms of the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

167
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:38,840
selected so when you roll the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dice</font>

168
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:43,940
5dimes you get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number as shown on the</font>

169
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:48,229
screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> there the 634 25 and the Internet</font>

170
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:51,350
has 7770 25 words listed randomly and

171
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:52,820
you match them to the numbers so your

172
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,370
role filed dice then you get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

173
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,320
word and then your roll 5 dice again to

174
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:00,470
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second word and is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

175
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,780
recommended at least six words doing the

176
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:05,450
rolling six times basically to get six

177
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,400
words there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> English words but</font>

178
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,810
they're not within normal syntax normal

179
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">gramp grammatical structure order</font>

180
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:13,580
they're just very randomly picked this

181
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">is very strong and to increase it you</font>

182
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,840
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually add an extra character like</font>

183
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,700
i did with vixen in the one below<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did</font>

184
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,359
an extra into that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give that</font>

185
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:26,750
extra element of security you can use !

186
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,670
various characters it's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you this</font>

187
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:33,110
is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is a really useful</font>

188
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:35,090
tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure you've all heard about the</font>

189
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,620
heartbleed situation we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> spoken</font>

190
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:41,570
about today a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> times I've heard</font>

191
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:42,979
already and and obviously there is a

192
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,310
recommendation for people to change

193
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:47,690
their passwords and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

194
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:50,119
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you don't practice safe</font>

195
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,850
passwords then obviously you know you're

196
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be at risk so we need to look</font>

197
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,790
at it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity to remind</font>

198
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,859
everyone really to look at their

199
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:01,790
passwords and that's why I<font color="#CCCCCC"> use password</font>

200
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:05,440
management systems and things like that

201
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:08,290
to give myself an extra security

202
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'll read a bit quicker than I</font>

203
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:13,209
thought there to be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and thank you</font>

204
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:16,360
all for watching and thanks for Tom for

205
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,950
supporting me and for organizing

206
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,350
everything here and the support and the

207
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:25,300
BSL support I've had today so and

208
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,800
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think in english and then</font>

209
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,079
it's been translated into BSL and then

210
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,579
it's going to go to en over to you it's

211
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,500
a bit like<font color="#E5E5E5"> google chrome translation</font>

212
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,300
going here from<font color="#E5E5E5"> English to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> russia and</font>

213
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,400
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back to english so it's all</font>

214
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,510
going to be a bit askew if so hopefully

215
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,590
you understand what the tutors been

216
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,790
speaking about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> today if you're</font>

217
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,260
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh my god what you're talking</font>

218
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:54,160
about it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> making any sense blame</font>

219
00:09:41,260 --> 00:10:00,100
interpreter not me<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay anybody have any</font>

220
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:01,719
questions Oh silence well yeah Silas is

221
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,520
normal for me but there we go some

222
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,970
what's you bastard you two dice matter

223
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:09,180
of just getting last fast to get around

224
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,180
them

225
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:30,070
yeah so basically the way that the dice

226
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,600
where works is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> its increases because</font>

227
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,280
of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> its set up its not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> following the</font>

228
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,940
structure<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the order it's randomly</font>

229
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:39,130
chosen it kind of increases the the

230
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,690
security levels in terms of the sequence

231
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,850
in the words and the orders<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

232
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,440
put him here for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example like i am you</font>

233
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,230
know grammatically speaking following

234
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,360
that structure and this wouldn't match

235
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,800
websites like wikipedia way it's all

236
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,540
done within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> english grammatical</font>

237
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,569
order so it's all mixed abetting a bit

238
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,890
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> skew if so that's kind of where the</font>

239
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">the strength of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes from in</font>

240
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,340
comparison to just doing a random

241
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:14,020
generated did that answer question<font color="#E5E5E5"> or of</font>

242
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:16,150
a gun off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point and then yeah yeah</font>

243
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,860
so it's used for the main password for

244
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,610
the year forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> fri out from a password</font>

245
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,610
management system

246
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,990
okay okay thank you everyone
