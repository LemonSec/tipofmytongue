1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,670
oh honey I can't see because of that

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,590
thing there we go right so basically

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:15,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a look at modern warfare and not</font>

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,460
called jewy we all know college<font color="#CCCCCC"> rate for</font>

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,460
was the best but it's not what's about

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:26,820
so I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> Caitlyn gartley I'm in the</font>

7
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:30,240
hacking citee<font color="#CCCCCC"> abertay you will see us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,390
are everywhere there's hoodies all over

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,149
the place<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> second-year shouldn't</font>

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,739
doing ethical hacking and I would also

11
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,200
just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out all the figures</font>

12
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:43,559
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers and this I have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,690
from various research and I can give you

14
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:51,828
I will send all this research / email

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:54,510
and my email address is at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end so</font>

16
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:56,579
what's this<font color="#CCCCCC"> about basically it's just a</font>

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:00,559
brief look into the costs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> produce</font>

18
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:03,270
both parts of war it's the cyber and the

19
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,789
real warfare suppose including the tax

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,369
and things in particular I looking at

21
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,820
the m1 Abrams which is a tank commonly

22
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:14,630
used in America and they're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">known sucks in it</font>

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,570
so why and I apologize for<font color="#CCCCCC"> my slide it</font>

25
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:24,190
didn't like it and so with the pants

26
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:27,279
advert advancements in technology today

27
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,960
it's becoming obvious that we need to

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into decide we need to look into</font>

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,080
computers and technology not only

30
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:38,259
warfare including tanks bombs and

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,520
soldiers are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way forward in this</font>

32
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,950
comparison the steps have been

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,979
generalized to get the best view through

34
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:51,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">the stages in the production for each</font>

35
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:56,740
item not<font color="#E5E5E5"> annoy me already there instead</font>

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,920
the m1 tank<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've gone back already gone</font>

37
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,929
bad so the m1 tank has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> used changed</font>

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,550
and advanced over the years in the

39
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,009
United States<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as many people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

40
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:09,940
that Stuxnet mouth piece of malware

41
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:18,250
Stuxnet was<font color="#CCCCCC"> affected in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Iran's nuclear</font>

42
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:20,859
systems so the m1 Abrams this is my list

43
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,410
of basically how I I believe it

44
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,080
generally made so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's other said it's a</font>

45
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:29,530
tank used in America it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in war such</font>

46
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,900
as the Afghan and the gulf wars over

47
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:34,269
9000 have been built it was built in

48
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,870
since 1980 it's been built in the lime

49
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:39,850
attack plant in Lima funnily enough I

50
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,150
don't weighs about sixty seven point six

51
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,150
tons

52
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,090
so as with anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone into it into</font>

53
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:50,599
production that has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be something a</font>

54
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:53,420
sufficient amount of research oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god</font>

55
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:56,328
right research to ensure the project can

56
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,589
be used and is needed really the

57
00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:01,790
research difference as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can imagine</font>

58
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:04,250
with each product I should expect you'd

59
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,590
need to research into materials weapons

60
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:11,420
new and old technology and the obvious

61
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:13,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like the color this would take a</font>

00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,858
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of people all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> specialize</font>

in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the road fields in particular and</font>

64
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:18,980
munitions expert would look into the

65
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,010
best way to protect the tank both<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

67
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,909
and this research<font color="#E5E5E5"> could take months</font>

68
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,409
before it's ready to actually go into

69
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:32,358
design stage the design stage is

70
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:34,250
obviously closely linked good ideas

71
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:36,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">focusing back and forward the design</font>

72
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,079
depends on different materials needed

73
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:41,269
and the different different materials

74
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:44,000
and different options needed on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tank</font>

75
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:46,609
obviously this stage could take time it

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,540
could take months before a prototype is

77
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:49,540
even ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be built</font>

78
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,370
then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a factory you can't just</font>

79
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,660
produce the time California the next

80
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,660
stage would obviously be to make the

81
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:01,130
prototype so you need you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need the</font>

82
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,049
factory you need the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

83
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:07,100
factory and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might even need to build</font>

84
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:11,900
a factory and this is automatically a

85
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:14,180
huge initial financial dedication you

86
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,890
need your machinery there needs to be

87
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,850
individual parts machinery gonna need

88
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,849
some machinery to put it all together

89
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:23,150
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not an easy you can't just go</font>

90
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,650
in you build a tank and specially

91
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">designed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not going to be cheap to</font>

92
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,890
buy

93
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,740
so the materials for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tank with a</font>

94
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:39,090
single ton of raw and machined steel

95
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:41,979
crossing currently around 380 US dollars

96
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:45,310
the weight translate at 60 tons to

97
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:49,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty two thousand dollars so you can</font>

98
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:52,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">imagine that alone just for steel it's</font>

99
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,539
an automatic this is from<font color="#E5E5E5"> an automatic</font>

101
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:59,020
materials you need the inside of the

102
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:00,849
tank such as the copper for the wiring

103
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,460
the glass for the screens the computer

104
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:07,719
systems and the comfy seats let's face

105
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:12,310
it so after<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you go back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

106
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:14,650

107
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">any company there's different tiers so</font>

108
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:21,310
as a general overview and this is taken

109
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,888
as of the 23rd of april 2014 and it's

110
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,840
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> general problem for America your</font>

your security and obviously just

120
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:55,419
everyone so before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can even use it</font>

121
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:57,219
it needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be tested and before you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

123
00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:03,759
my god methodology the exact criteria

124
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,400
the test themself this can include

125
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,229
specialist tracks or courses different

126
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,690
locations different attacks on the tank

127
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:12,909
itself so<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore you need to fill</font>

128
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,940
down the prototype you've just you've

129
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:17,770
just got rid of your tank<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you need</font>

130
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,860
to test the unborn systems such as fire

131
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:23,380
control and navigations once these tests

132
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,440
have been done let's face it more design

133
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:29,139
more research more<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything is going</font>

134
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,449
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in so to progress we're going to</font>

135
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:33,630
say tank<font color="#E5E5E5"> brilliant or put nice</font>

progression

137
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:40,698
so you go into production run a product

138
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:45,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">goes introduction there's still many</font>

buy every unit today but today's can't

143

figure is not considering they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

144
00:06:55,729 --> 00:07:02,330
built now it would be 57,000 132 million

145
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,830
dollars just for these tanks alone

146
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:07,010
that's not including the costs behind

as well you can't tell off so here

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,430
there's not as many but you can't tell

everyone what your intended to do so

200

here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> type store your tests and all</font>

203

that's bad and so you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

204
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,190
research so before the court could

205
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,040
actually go out you have to check<font color="#E5E5E5"> code</font>

206
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,300
that's been done and if it actually can

<font color="#CCCCCC">you get into the system you're trying to</font>

to do when it gets there this can take a

216
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:21,220
you need to write the code which even

with multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> quarters is going to take</font>
