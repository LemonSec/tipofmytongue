opened the business for easy peasy which

<font color="#E5E5E5">schools and teach primary kids</font>

23
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:11,158
programming using schools using tools

24
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,510
like scratch Cotto oil etc and it was

25
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,479
one of an<font color="#CCCCCC"> after school activity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rather</font>

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,250
than just<font color="#CCCCCC"> lucky so our son mentioned we</font>

27
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,679
start this in September last year as a

28
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,710
university project myself and salmon

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,880
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> other students I manage it we've</font>

30
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,860
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a lot of interest with</font>

31
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,939
sword groaning to just<font color="#E5E5E5"> this big project</font>

32
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,119
we've got loads of schools in South

33
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,710
Yorkshire at all we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a</font>

34
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,950
lot of interest but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did it into</font>

35
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,139
a BBC<font color="#E5E5E5"> Radio Sheffield a couple of months</font>

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago which was huge and getting is</font>

37
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,470
involved so

38
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,659
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we also part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the National Science</font>

39
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,970
energy engineering week where we went to

40
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:49,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">school we did a one-hour talk with</font>

41
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,560
primary kids and you basically try to

42
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,810
get them engaged in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> program we talk</font>

43
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:58,759
about the basics of<font color="#E5E5E5"> rowing and did some</font>

44
00:01:53,810 --> 00:02:01,310
point exercises games etc so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

45
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,320
tools like scratch we hooked up the xbox

46
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,790
360<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kinect with it we didn't bring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

47
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,199
here today we just want to show one of

48
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:10,520
the things we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that arduino best</font>

49
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,200
blog we also mentioned boops a beloved

50
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">lacy one of the world's first program is</font>

51
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,920
in the eighteen hundreds technically<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

52
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,180
how women were quite prominent actually

53
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,190
in programming so trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get girls</font>

54
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,350
interested in this as well we think

55
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's really important someone mentions</font>

56
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,910
you are signs week a little bit briefly

57
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,260
what we did we did these with activities

58
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,070
such as the one we're about to show you

59
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:33,049
and we've got some images from that well

60
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:34,880
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> often scientific where we</font>

61
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,670
actually want to do schools and the

62
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,230
first 100 kids and we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exercise</font>

63
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,790
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Widow and they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own little</font>

64
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,010
Marcus where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can follow</font>

65
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:46,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">tutorials and they were making games</font>

66
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,870
using if statements<font color="#CCCCCC"> lumatek cetera it's</font>

67
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,190
just one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the several talks we did</font>

68
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,630
have a video but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we couldn't get</font>

69
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,670
permission from the parents for the kids

70
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,900
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to show that but those</font>

71
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,200
massages i'm going to show you the demo

72
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,200
now

73
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,450
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of the tools we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use to</font>

74
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,579
get kids engaged so just a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

75
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,649
back on before I start<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

76
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,660
you scott and maki maki<font color="#E5E5E5"> its best on an</font>

77
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,340
arduino leonardo bootloader and all it

78
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,079
does is probably plug in crocodile clips

79
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,970
to certain keys on the keyboard I don't

80
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,800
hear what we do is we show them on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

81
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the screen what a certain sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

82
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,490
like been driven programming and we show

83
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,250
them like so what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> what does each</font>

84
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:28,010
key do it plays a no so if i<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to see</font>

85
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,890
which is the octal a pleasant noise on

86
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:33,380
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trust your key and we</font>

87
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,790
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about all the logical so how it</font>

88
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,890
changes the logical concept of

89
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:40,030
programming it changes the costume and

90
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:48,049
left<font color="#E5E5E5"> and but before we do that with them</font>

91
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:49,040
we actually so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurt yourself I knew</font>

92
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:54,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">it wouldn't work one engine stopped</font>

93
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:56,630
imagine there we go and usually works

94
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:02,290
quite well well this morning didn't very

95
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:05,500
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one's not connected sorry</font>

96
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,120
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do with kids it gets</font>

97
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,310
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interested in it and there's</font>

98
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,469
so many things you could do with it we

99
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,599
had self pac-man with some blue<font color="#E5E5E5"> tuck and</font>

100
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:14,590
you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> an up-down left-right I'm</font>

101
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,599
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> they press it and the birth</font>

102
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,548
themselves they can play pacman so it's

103
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,590
really interesting so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> played for a</font>

104
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:26,888
while then we teach them<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code behind</font>

105
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:28,989
it that's the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok all right so why</font>

106
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:30,880
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we doing this and I don't want to</font>

107
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,320
bore you with loads of from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nats</font>

108
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,930
from the national curriculum in England

109
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,440
framework this is coming to place in

110
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:41,020
September 2014 and it's replacing the

111
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,699
ICT subjects for<font color="#E5E5E5"> air to call computing</font>

112
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,070
and be learning programming that's the

113
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:47,620
theory behind it so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the key</font>

114
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:50,770
stage 2 framework and basically kids

115
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,389
will be learning coding or using cuticle

116
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,698
kids will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning log in to the</font>

117
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:56,650
basics<font color="#E5E5E5"> of programs have to be programs</font>

118
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,750
how they simply work<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

119
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,460
learning a lot simple networks and the

120
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,789
world wide web<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how to use browsers</font>

121
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,530
to get data etc again breaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rule</font>

122
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:07,240
of loads of text on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen but this</font>

123
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,030
is Key Stage three the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> point we took</font>

124
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,139
away from it were secondary school is

125
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,000
Key Stage three sort of been doing

126
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:14,560
boolean logic and doors or not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

127
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,409
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of going to electronical engineer</font>

128
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,320
as well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> also as the main concepts of</font>

129
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:23,590
program as well and to textual programs

130
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's supposed to use and so pythons of</font>

131
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,619
in walnut a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> schools using nothing</font>

132
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's really cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll university</font>

133
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:33,460
should start using that move from C++ to

134
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:37,780
python and also binary digits so this is

135
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:39,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plan but there is a big problem so</font>

136
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,130
we did a lot of research to do this and

137
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,470
we looked into a lot with us and we were

138
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,840
to academic anchorwoman report and if

139
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,610
you for the next slide these are one

140
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,489
reports<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at this is the uk's</font>

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:57,120
by the National audiobus last one in

143
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,460
terms of text<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the screen a shortage</font>

144
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,229
of ICT with<font color="#E5E5E5"> focusing on cybersecurity</font>

145
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,989
and how we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is gonna be a shortage</font>

146
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:06,240
of ICT skills and IT skills and kids

147
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,590
understand how a computer works and

148
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,940
that's gonna affect cybersecurity so

149
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,818
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get kids more involved with</font>

150
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">that younger age that's not the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

151
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:16,289
problem thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other problems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

152
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,539
that I'm in the government and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the all</font>

153
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:20,068
<font color="#E5E5E5">the education initiative they are trying</font>

154
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">to push the national curriculum into</font>

155
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:25,050
school but the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not with them</font>

156
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,990
is with the teachers make the cat can

157
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:30,270
teachers really teach computer science

158
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,860
the answer would be no I mean often<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

159
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> research</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into this and they are</font>

160
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,500
officially many statement that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

161
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,060
skills shortage amount ICT teachers and

162
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,380
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really know a lot about</font>

163
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,300
computer science they're used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

164
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,360
teaching<font color="#CCCCCC"> Boyle closes in packages</font>

165
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,580
databases presentations etc so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

166
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">considered a big issue so means some</font>

167
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,960
compared our education we did ICT never

168
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:53,520
got any guidance in programming it was

169
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,609
all off my own back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sam's on back</font>

170
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,750
it's all word processing and can they

171
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,860
deliver on it no the car there's a

172
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,360
shortage of the teachers that can

173
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually do this is even a theory that</font>

174
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,830
mathematician should be teaching

175
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:06,330
computer science so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mannequin</font>

176
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,448
what we like to do is we like to have a

177
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:11,758
sort of analogy with it where we got a

178
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:14,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">computer's like a car so I ct's how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

179
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,960
learn to drive the car but computing the

180
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,030
wrong is going underneath the car<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock</font>

181
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,250
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> car</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bro sort of how can we</font>

182
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,900
manipulate a car and change them for our

183
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,030
own users that's the main idea that we

184
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,008
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull forward to it so before we gets</font>

185
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,929
a solution what we think what should be

186
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:30,750
done about it we took some quotes from

187
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,370
various academics professionals and

188
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,409
cybersecurity and and IT that we've got

189
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,979
quotes from alive network with Sam's

190
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:39,810
network weapon you in your place on so

191
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:42,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one is from dr. David</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day he's</font>

192
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,400
at our University of Halla is a lecturer

193
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,930
in forensics and also security

194
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,390
consultant for quite a lot of

195
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,360
high-profile retailer

196
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:52,669
to work that and also is quite common to

197
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,810
catch up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on lost eight members so he</font>

198
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">knows what he's talking about in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terms</font>

199
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:59,690
of security<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so David learn</font>

200
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:01,539
programming from BBC<font color="#CCCCCC"> micro computers</font>

201
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:04,010
rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than learning ICT like we did and</font>

202
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,800
David does agree with everything we said

203
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:09,680
and he he called<font color="#E5E5E5"> students these days</font>

204
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,030
code aerobics and he believes<font color="#CCCCCC"> University</font>

205
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,770
students these days when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm afraid of</font>

206
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,140
programming because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> never learned</font>

207
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:17,060
from a young age so now they find<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

208
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,930
really difficult I mean he'll two things

209
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,640
coding is a big part of UK security and

210
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,590
use another quote from this from dr.

211
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,539
Nick<font color="#CCCCCC"> blundell he's the chief software</font>

212
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:29,060
engineer with step 1 so we spoke with

213
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,700
Nick I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a role at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SEC one in</font>

214
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,620
June as a pen tester and he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

215
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,850
it was in higher education before so

216
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,130
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been speaking to me talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

217
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:39,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">how developer training materials of the</font>

00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,919
he teaches them but they move that<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font>

220
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,600
their advance careers and they're always

already<font color="#E5E5E5"> embedded with vulnerabilities he</font>

222
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,140
mentions of rubber floors sequel

223
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,430
injections and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking</font>

224
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,810
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> them about teaching college</font>

225
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,540
students if we move into college

226
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,430
students from any CPC and develop

227
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,689
tutorials and exercises that we can

228
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:01,280
teach each safety as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as cyber</font>

229
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:03,140
security as well so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next quote is</font>

230
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,550
from Jasper jerk and opposite critical

231
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,250
watch he's the vice president<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

232
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,870
research there in the USA and I reached

233
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,390
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to him we speak on linkedin quite a</font>

234
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,550
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I just expected a call but he</font>

235
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,350
actually wrote an article for LA on his

236
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,390
blog on this so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't got a whole</font>

link link to this we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> took really</font>

238
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,160
important things we thought really

239
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful someone mention these two so just</font>

240
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,520
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> payson</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agrees with the fact kids</font>

should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning computer science at</font>

242
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,560
an early age he also think that a kid

243
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:33,200
should you know do gamification play

244
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,510
games to learn security like capture the

245
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,070
flag<font color="#E5E5E5"> security chance etcetera rather</font>

246
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:40,470
than just sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a classroom</font>

247
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:42,780
learning theory but<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's an obvious do</font>

248
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,070
clash<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one mind that he thinks he</font>

249
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,199
should choose what they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn</font>

250
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:49,070
where we think every student should

251
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,800
bloom computer scientist and mandatory

252
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:54,120
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next quote is from Christian</font>

253
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,520
senior manager or product of

254
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,470
inconsiderate so I know Chris personally

255

I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> fronting who Donna Citrix with</font>

mentioned micro model BBC micro model

258

computer and that's also what David

259
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,540
dimension so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we seem to notice a theme</font>

260
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:13,470
how when computers came to the masses

261
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,969
how a programming happened quite early

262
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,970
on and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this seems to be shift in</font>

263
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:19,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">the past</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 to 15 years on ICT and how</font>

264
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,360
you know how to use a copy of this

265
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,470
program isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from our fashion so it</font>

266
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,240
means to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> that back in now</font>

267
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,220
especially with cyber<font color="#CCCCCC"> Skerries we can</font>

best citrix the next quote was from

the fat kid children computer science he

280
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:56,340
also talks about how Kate o-tar from Key

Stage one they learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> what basic or QT</font>

282
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,880
programming with games and they need

283
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,280
when they get to keep these three

284
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:07,080
they'll be learning python visual basic
