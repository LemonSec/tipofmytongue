18
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,218
scenario that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm working on here is</font>

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a corporate</font>

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,709
there and then what happened cool so we

23
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:02,940
look at phones personal devices people

24
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:06,240
carry around phones tablets small

25
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,740
laptops and they have a lot of crap

them that kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are a</font>

28
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,150
lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues that are</font>

associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these devices so let's</font>

say you've you've lost your device<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

31
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,060

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,400
up-and-coming way of solving mobile

solutions for companies you have both

lost corporate data big issue how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

40
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,990
solve that problem a compromise device

41
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,729
you're downloading maybe applications

42
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">it'd be built porn every now and then on</font>

your BYOD device and yet you know virus

44
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,259
has happened they're out there in the

a few here and there on iOS you see the

the pokemon GBA also gba emulator that's

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,110
just come out on iPhones circumventing

the iOS sorry the ice stores permissions

around it it's possible to get data

there shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on phones on phones</font>

and vulnerable services phones

54
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,390
you download your applications to do

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:22,719
crap all over the place so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

issues associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that broadcasting</font>

everybody things<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> iphone is a</font>

services running at you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys to say</font>

63

chicken various other things that's not

64
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:36,730
the massive issue the massive issue is

65
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,679
the various different adapters that run

66
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,750
on the phone so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> say broadcasting</font>

67
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,730
leakage we can go pro requests so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

68
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,109
sure most of you aware but Wi-Fi devices

69
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,608
are constantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking out for the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">network they've previously connected to</font>

71
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:50,349
you can record that data the<font color="#CCCCCC"> snoopy guys</font>

72
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:52,268
put together some great tools for doing

73
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:54,939
that but if you don't want to go in

74
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:56,260
deploy<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know on a raspberry pi or all</font>

75
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:58,299
the crazy stuff they do there's just

76
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,608
something called I sniff it's a great

77
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:03,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">tool runs straight out of the box put on</font>

78
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:06,700
any device in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the laptop with a an</font>

79
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,709
adapter and you can listen to all the

80
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,679
devices in the area where they've been

81
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:13,840
and start to correlate that data with

82
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,730
locations so if you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,329
wiggle you can say okay this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the SSID</font>

with somebody lives work out where they

87
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,949
work you can sub build up a profile of

88

somebody just by being in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right area</font>

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,870
a privacy perspective we look at

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bluetooth most security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't use</font>

110
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,370
bluetooth so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's fairly</font>

111
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,899
sensible but out there in the wild

112
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,940
normal people use bluetooth where are

00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,790
same thing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the probe request we did</font>

sorry

118
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,310
exact thing with booties is doing the

perp request and<font color="#CCCCCC"> start to see what</font>

with improvements there's more holes and

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,850
more holes means more fun for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and NFC</font>

we all know about Charlie Miller<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

this crazy stuff it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a it's a big</font>

builds and so the the black phone is a

00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,820
good example user awareness training so

147
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,550
training individuals if you're a

connected to things work on that

152

00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,310
out there now people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> pushing in that</font>

154
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,719
direction but is it working there's

155
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,430
anybody seen any working examples

156
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,130
currently I would say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's catching</font>

157
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,380
the obvious examples which<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google Play</font>

00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">Store catching which the iOS guys</font>

159
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,310
already threw out so you know is it

160
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually working is it heuristic is it</font>

161
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,410
just a simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh it much is this the</font>

162
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,630
signature therefore it's thought you

163
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:03,380
don't download it and yell at your

164

know everybody's mentioning heartbleed

177
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,530
people getting very upset about

178
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,690
something and they're getting fixed

179
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">really quickly because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it had that</font>

180
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,960
motivation behind it because it was

181
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,460
because it's interesting so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

182
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,620
get some more graphic designers involved

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen testing gets them all</font>

184
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:47,440
goes make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple more websites</font>

185
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:49,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">luther's so Bruce is a bit of a bit of</font>

an odd one really a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people don't</font>

187
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">think of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reuters has sort of normal pcs</font>

188
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,370
to attack that just to note that sort of

189
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,290
piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> kit over there that sits there</font>

190
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:02,020
and allows you to connect to the

191
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:03,100
internet and that's fine so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Reuters can</font>

192
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,500
be compromised and I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in the</font>

193
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,639
wrong order here but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chameleon</font>

194
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,130
attack that came out this year I think

195
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,560
got a lot more media attention in the

196
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,719
wrong way that it deserved it said<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

197
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,240
you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the new kind of virus</font>

198
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,270
it goes like a human virus it spreads

199
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,060
over the air it's pretty scary if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

200
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,948
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific kind of router if you manage</font>

201
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,960
to bring specific kinds of Reuters into

202
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:27,490
similar areas to compromise devices to

203
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,380
get the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of Reuters around the</font>

204
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,630
world it would spread<font color="#CCCCCC"> the virus what was</font>

205
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,889
interesting was that it created a

206
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,090
situation where you can put something<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

207
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:35,710
a mobile device and take over<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

208
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,409
router and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody else's data</font>

209
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,299
it's that secondary step not the

210
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,460
compromise not the spread that kind of

211
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,349
thing that relies on every<font color="#CCCCCC"> root of being</font>

212
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,549
available to that attack what was

213
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:47,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting was that you could have</font>

214
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,870
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a mobile phone that could</font>

215
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,950
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to the Reuther and compromise the</font>

216
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,479
data that's on it you can you could

217
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,530
sniff all the traffic going through it

218
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,150
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to man in the middle</font>

219
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,760
somebody you madam that you already<font color="#E5E5E5"> took</font>

220
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:00,190
over the rooster it's an instant man in

221
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,479
the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other users on</font>

222
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,520
Reuters when you're connecting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:04,990
coffee shop<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi that kind of stuff</font>

224
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,030
other people can potentially see your

225
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,360
traffic because Wi-Fi isn't totally

226
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,359
secure

227
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:16,200
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> ruther compromised what can you do</font>

228
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:21,060
once you got it so either going after a

229
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:22,800
Rooter or creating a rogue AP so road

230
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,980
network that takes advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

231
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,000
probe request<font color="#CCCCCC"> request I mentioned</font>

232
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,090
earlier what can you do with you

233
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,730
forcibly connect to a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the</font>

234
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,199
compromised a Rooter that's hosting a

235
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,300
network you're connected to what can you

236
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,400
do obviously you can sniff HTTP

237
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:42,299
credentials stuff in plain text that's

238
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:47,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">really simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can dns poof people</font>

239
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:49,199
onto going going from regular correct IP

240
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,730
address associated with URLs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your own</font>

241
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,650
ones that's pretty straightforward<font color="#CCCCCC"> dunno</font>

242
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,050
as well as the cell stripping didn't

243
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,220
work for quite a while there's a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

244
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,650
break in the development of that tool

245
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,000
with a new pineapple it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

246
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,990
dream it's absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing and</font>

247
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,180
there's some really upsetting people

248
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,490
that are vulnerable to it I'm not going

249
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:08,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">to name names because I'm on camera and</font>

250
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:11,730
marrow injection we have some great<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

251
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:15,449
again with the pineapple using captive

252
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,010
portal setups to push malicious apks

253

by a very basic social engineer exact

<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm going to speed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up quite a lot now so</font>

256
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,460
how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> mitigate these issues well</font>

257
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,360
you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a VPN you can just skirt</font>

258
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,360
straight through the roots or issue

259
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,650
altogether everything's encrypted great

260
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,180
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> a corporation and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font>

261
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,260
patching on your roosters and keep them

262
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">up to date I mean that's going to</font>

263
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,170
mitigate some of the issue but not all

264
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're an individual again</font>

you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see a theme here yeah</font>

266
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,100
let your provider yell at the people

00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,270
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing the the network security</font>

268
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,730
for you if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're not doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it properly</font>

269
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you need to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure they do if</font>

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,240
you upset<font color="#E5E5E5"> about things and make noise</font>

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,920
internet you're not really worried too

273
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:57,030
much about<font color="#E5E5E5"> me or him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or you sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,290
finding stuff on the internet that's

275
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,579
going over but you do are worried about

276
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,630
state surveillance and if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

277
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,280
worried about state's offense you really

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,530
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be or working in a hostile</font>

279
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,939
environment a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us do work going</font>

280
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,560
overseas<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that kind of stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

281
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,700
into countries where they do just sort

282
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,530
of intercept data as a matter of course

283
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,030
if you're just connecting straight back

284
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">to your corporations websites and</font>

285
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,020
everything like that in the clear text

286
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,000

concern over there and if the worst

00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,350
can go straight into straight into the

00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:40,079
somebody picks up that phone and gets

324
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,970
through the locking mechanism they can

game over whatever you've got on that

333

00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,490
authentication yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you VPN din</font>

338
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,220
you've got the right certs on the the

device but secondary authentication to

340
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,640
access the privileged stuff on though

341
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,280
you need to basically compromise both

342
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,800
the phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the person's account and</font>

restricted internet access so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">the beginning are there any question</font>
