7
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:31,400
various manual checks to do a very

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:39,830
to automate majority of the services so

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:42,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">majority of the checks which mainly</font>

12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:49,330
integrates lot of other tools and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:52,010
it does select lot of manual checks<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

14
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:55,820
let's talk about like panspermia tool

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:58,699
kit because<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL is SSL auditor is part</font>

16
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,829
of panspermia to eat what friends for me

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">a fence for me means like life exists</font>

18
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:05,329
everywhere across the universe and 80s

19
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:09,320
transfer from one planet to other planet

20
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:13,100
or one entity to other entity like moons

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,929
or asteroids or comets through other

22
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:20,449
entities like comets or asteroids and

23
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:24,080
how is this related<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this talk is</font>

24
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:27,409
where when we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like IT there</font>

25
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,110
are like multiple worlds which which are

26
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:32,150
like for example networking is a

27
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,820
different world with like database is a

28
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:38,540
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> world and you have something</font>

29
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,830
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtualization and then you have</font>

30
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,420
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating systems you have</font>

31
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:45,140
application so all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are like</font>

00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:48,860
different different board and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

33
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:51,619
Thanks for meeting Cait has like I'm see

34
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:54,860
like developing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay has like a tune</font>

35
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:58,270
to tech tackle the issues in each of

36
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:02,390
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> boards</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and all these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pictures</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

37
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:05,240
like various planets that might have

38
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,720
life in them so we don't know they're

39
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,699
all few light-years away so we are not

40
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,850
that advanced to even<font color="#E5E5E5"> X to take life one</font>

41
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:16,130
hundred percent let's

42
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:21,859
go ahead with SSN auditor which is also

43
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:24,109
called like Obama Nia<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay why /</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be Nia</font>

44

web what's the meaning of the name of

55
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:01,430
difficult to reach how is this related

56
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:04,460
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my talk my tool has like five modules</font>

57
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:07,040
to check for various issues on the

58
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:11,080
services which relate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the five eyes</font>

59
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:14,450
off of erwinia and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> input module is</font>

60
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:18,140
very flexible to accept input from

61
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:22,459
multiple sources so which relates<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

62
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:26,660
long probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's have an overview</font>

63
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:29,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">so this is a complete picture of my tool</font>

64
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:32,930
like the checks it does and the various

65
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:38,650
options it has that present edges around

66
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:43,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">30 checks on SSL and auditing services</font>

67
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,570
let's go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> each of these components</font>

68
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:50,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the first component is the input</font>

69
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:53,310
modules and the execution modules my

70
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:57,150
tool accepts like four different sources

71
00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:00,360
of input one is is from on the interface

72
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,459
itself so you can add your IP or host on

73
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,489
the interface and it acts of that the

74
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,500
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> option is a range which you can</font>

75
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,329
see on the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight eight tackles like</font>

76
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,000
a star type<font color="#E5E5E5"> II and then he can specify</font>

77
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:15,510
the NDP and regenerate the entire list

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,470
for you the third option is I beliefs

79
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:22,969
while there are multiple ways it will

80
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:26,820
read those<font color="#CCCCCC"> ip's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh you can separate an</font>

81
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:30,180
IP or hostname and the port using colon

82
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:33,270
or space or comma so it accepts<font color="#E5E5E5"> CSV</font>

83
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,070
files and the other option is it does

84
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,859
sanitization so you don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

85
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:42,360
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very strict</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this particular</font>

86
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:45,330
form of like URL or some a does like it

87
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,660
will just remove HTTP and all those kind

88
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:51,359
of prefixes and suffixes and the fourth

89
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,250
option is an web.xml file which<font color="#CCCCCC"> accepts</font>

90
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,150
like multiple reports you can just

91
00:04:53,250 --> 00:05:00,080
specify<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay grab all the I piece of</font>

92
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:03,870
horse with in this specific port open

93
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,570
and now let's come to the execution

94
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,190
options there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a few options</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which or</font>

95
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,070
quite important the first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

96
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:16,139
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment which since</font>

97
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:17,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">legum sometimes you might be testing ssl</font>

98
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:20,039
services in a development<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and you</font>

99
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,919
don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> flag like a self-signed</font>

100
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:25,650
certificates or untrusted such a case so

101
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,680
this options ignores<font color="#CCCCCC"> now four of the</font>

102
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,380
checks which is like revocation list

103
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,770
self-signed while<font color="#E5E5E5"> quad-city and</font>

104
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,729
reciprocate

105
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:39,299
so and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other option in the tool</font>

106
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:42,349
is automated primers so when the tool

107
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,750
identifies a timeout or an error aight

108
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:48,000
increases time to 2x and then if it

109
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:52,069
still gets the same error or timeout it

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,159
pushes it to 5x before it moves to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

111
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:58,500
it before it moves to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next module</font>

112
00:05:55,159 --> 00:06:04,500
and we'll be looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> autofill options</font>

113
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:06,360
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> furthest flight and with respect</font>

114
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,639
to the scan speed there is an option to

115
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:13,110
increase or decrease the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan speed it's</font>

116
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:17,460
mainly useful when you are running the

117
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:19,319
tool against a local service or a remote

118
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,409
service mainly like if it is like going

119
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:25,169
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet probably it might</font>

120
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:27,479
be like slow so you don't want the tool

121
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:34,440
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> timeout like very force so you can</font>

122
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:36,930
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce a try let's now look at the</font>

123
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:43,860
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cipher checks there a tool does</font>

124
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:45,630
like the two checks for the various<font color="#CCCCCC"> flag</font>

125
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,479
protocols that are supported by the ssl

126
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:50,009
service and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also it does check for the</font>

127
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,830
various ciphers that are supported by

128
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:54,930
each of those protocols and then at

129
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:58,169
least the<font color="#CCCCCC"> preferred cipher for each of</font>

130
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:02,969
the protocol and eight flags if it finds

131
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:07,039
ssl version 2 or any of the week ciphers

132
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:09,810
enabled and this is a sample report and

133
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:13,889
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the various fields in the</font>

134
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:16,770
report now let's look at such a tricks

135
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:20,180
yeah these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certificate</font>

136
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:24,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">check series the tool does for you so</font>

137
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:26,969
mainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight he does check for various</font>

138
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,758
issues on the subjugate itself as well

139
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:32,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">as a you check for various issues on the</font>

140
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,870
configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ssl service</font>

141
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:38,199
some of them can<font color="#CCCCCC"> build the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> self signed</font>

142
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:43,150
validity or wild courses certificate so

143
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:47,830
weak toast off like week RSA key so weak

144
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:50,590
signing algorithms and the ways things

145
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:53,198
related to configuration include like<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

146
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:57,878
<font color="#E5E5E5">static or compression which leads to</font>

147
00:07:53,199 --> 00:08:02,199
crime and fashion resumption<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

148
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:04,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">security negotiation now let's look at</font>

149
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:08,199
web so is why did I include like web

150
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:10,870
service checks in an SSL to say it's

151
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,180
quite important because if you look at

152
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:16,599
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> modern web servers they support a</font>

153
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:19,479
lot of additional features<font color="#CCCCCC"> so say for</font>

154
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:22,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">example like HFCS header which greatly</font>

155
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:24,758
improves the security of an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl sawey so</font>

156
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,879
it's very important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have these</font>

157
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:31,449
headers in place to have a very strong

158
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:34,630
castle so this module checks of various

159
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:38,440
headers on the ssl service it also

160
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:41,740
checks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aquarius tools like cookie</font>

161
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,649
flags and care settings but these are on

162
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:48,430
the index page it it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a web app</font>

163
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:52,149
scanner satanic for inside the pages so

164
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:56,130
and it also checks for various

165
00:08:52,149 --> 00:09:01,170
disclosures through<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's our headers</font>

166
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:05,420
now let's look at the other module which

167
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:07,680
is an RDP server this rdp service

168
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,500
supports like three protocols so this

169
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,180
module<font color="#CCCCCC"> X checks for the support of like</font>

170
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,870
each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these protocol one is elected</font>

171
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:17,370
ssv<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NATO rdp and if ssl is</font>

172
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,100
enable it will check for self-signed

173
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:22,710
certificates and weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> i first if nature</font>

174
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,170
ODP is enabled it to check for the

175
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:27,570
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> level as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as like the</font>

176
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:34,050
cipher supported by them by their

177
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:37,440
service and yeah the<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiters this is</font>

178
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:39,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">another module with checks for the</font>

179
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,290
mainly the validity of the certificate

180
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:45,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it gives like a different coloring</font>

181
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,810
for if it is like expiring or expired

182
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:52,589
way it's mainly focused towards

183
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:54,989
administrators and it's like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> report</font>

184
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:57,060
structure which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does like to</font>

185
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,010
report when if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like validity in the</font>

186
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,869
audit report audio to participation l1

187
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:03,750
which gives let more detailed

188
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:06,690
information about the ssl surveys and

189
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,940
validity report is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a table</font>

190
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:15,480
which gives like which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> expired or</font>

191
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:17,640
expiring or it's fine and yeah maybe I

192
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,300
think like we are running out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time so</font>

193
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:24,660
just keep the demo and I'm like very
