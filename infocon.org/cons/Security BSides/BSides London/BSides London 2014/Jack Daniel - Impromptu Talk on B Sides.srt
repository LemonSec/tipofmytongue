the edge of interest where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> audience</font>

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,910
nominal fee does for both a shoestring

144
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,530
budget economically run place but also

145
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,260
the no-show and the problem with no

146
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:02,020
shows is you're buying food and so

147
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,820
that's its effectively free you know

148
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:09,099
you're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money's worth but</font>

149
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:11,080
these events<font color="#E5E5E5"> the word sponsor is used at</font>

150
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:13,870
all sorts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of big events and corporate</font>

151
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,289
events when the word vendor is more

152
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,789
appropriate but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it besides we want</font>

153
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:21,490
people that are part of the community

154
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:25,750
that will engage you in a conversation

155
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,860
which is not simply you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> skiing you</font>

156
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,210
would you like me to schedule<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

157
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,560
appointment with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an engineer next week</font>

158
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,469
now we actually people<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have</font>

159
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,620
conversations<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so sponsors make it</font>

160
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,719
work people who present make it work the

161
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,060
volunteers and organizers the magic is

162
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:41,140
that the one in Las Vegas was a handful

163
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,650
of us that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be there</font>

164
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,719
anyway

165
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:46,419
now we weren't local but we made the

166
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,460
event happen the folks in California in

167
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:49,990
Mountain View were local they wanted to

168
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,969
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen they made it happen in</font>

169
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,039
San Francisco a local team of people in

170
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,539
San Francisco made it that way well the

171
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,370
one in Vegas<font color="#CCCCCC"> felt like we were in Vegas</font>

172
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:59,500
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because it was a thousand</font>

173
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">degrees one in San Francisco felt like</font>

174
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,389
San Francisco because we're in a

175
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:06,430
co-working space in soma where the taco

176
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:10,740
truck pulled up for lunch one day you

177
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,740
know it was it felt like San Francisco

178
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:18,430
this kind of feels like London and it's

179
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty sweet and it's very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flexible but</font>

180
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:24,130
we have these ideas sponsors not vendors

181
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,600
I know that's semantics but it really

182
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,960
means something we want people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

183
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,340
engaged everybody to participate and

184
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,530
that's why I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really taken off</font>

185
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,630
so he did one in San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Francisco</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

186
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:36,669
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in austin texas and one in</font>

187
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,849
denver and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the first year came up</font>

188
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:42,698
first anniversary we had another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in</font>

189
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:45,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">las vegas and from there it's simply</font>

190
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:53,229
accelerated as i said i believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

191
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:54,669
event number 122 think by this summer is

192
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:57,610
Las Vegas<font color="#CCCCCC"> one we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be close to</font>

193
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:58,840
135 137 it doesn't really matter what

194
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,270
the score is though because there have

195
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,820
been this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fourth London their</font>

196
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:07,090
Bowman's in Vienna there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been ones</font>

197
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:11,710
in Algiers Cape<font color="#CCCCCC"> Town South Africa sau</font>

Paulo gold coast of Australia all across

199
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,849
the US and<font color="#E5E5E5"> canada</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and they all reflect</font>

200
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:18,340
the local community and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they bring</font>

201
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:20,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">people together a lot of b-sides events</font>

202
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,750
have created local security communities

203
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:24,760
the one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Detroit has actually created</font>

204
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:28,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michigan security community my sec</font>

205
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,889
which has changed the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> people work it</font>

206
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,990
has changed the connectivity of the

207
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:34,779
groups and that's the magic it's the

208
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,520
power of it you come in people ask what

209
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:38,380
people ask me all the time about exhort

210
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,130
organizing<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I want to organize an</font>

211
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:45,820
event so cool how do I measure success

212
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:48,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay really simple baseline you do not</font>

213
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,320
measure success by headcount it is cool

214
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,779
to have a big event but you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

215
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,620
measure success by money spent you

216
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:57,260
measure success by

217
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,760
did you lose money<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the event that's</font>

218
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,800
actually not the first one but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

219
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,740
an organizer did you lose money

220
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,260
personally on the vent generally we

221
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,580
scare people enough that they do it but

222
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:12,529
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> you tell if the event was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

223
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:16,390
success is where people<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy be cool</font>

224
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:18,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">even yeah do you see any talks no really</font>

225
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,000
yeah but I caught up with this guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

226
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,110
used to work with and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it turns out he's</font>

227
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,710
doing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and I'm doing this</font>

228
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,540
thing oh cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> see me talks yep watch</font>

229
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,070
talks all day it was great because I

230
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,469
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to work the booth at</font>

231
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,450
whatever vendor con I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> normally be</font>

232
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,070
trapped at I saw talks all day I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

233
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">people I remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to know how to</font>

234
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,339
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> security stuff that sounds kind of</font>

235
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:42,800
personal that's that's not

236
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:45,320
autobiographical little but don't set

237
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,819
expectations for you know does it work

238
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,800
for you to make you connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> with people</font>

239
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:52,640
did you reconnect with people to do

240
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,680
we've launched and it accelerated a lot

241
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,260
of careers because people connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

242
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:00,589
people we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to believe</font>

243
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:03,230
that info SEC is a meritocracy and our

244
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:07,070
skillset drives us forward and that's

245
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:08,720
what drives us forward and I would hope

246
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:12,260
that everybody gets driven forward with

247
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,850
their skill set however sometimes you

248
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,100
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know who to show your skill set</font>

249
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,600
to to move forward it's not a polite way

250
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,220
of saying socially engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> your way</font>

251
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,839
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the corporate ladder but that's</font>

252
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,029
that's it so these are things that

253
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:25,209
b-sides really stands for<font color="#E5E5E5"> is making</font>

254
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:27,560
connections sustaining connections

255
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:29,329
another thing that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

256
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,239
events that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> does i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think they all</font>

257
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:34,880
do extremely well as take people and get

258
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,089
them more<font color="#CCCCCC"> comfortable speaking the</font>

259
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,459
mentorship program the rookie tracks are

260
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:44,300
phenomenal because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ability to</font>

261
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:45,920
communicate even if you don't want to if

262
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,510
you're uncomfortable in audiences you

263
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,610
don't want to be able to just<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand up</font>

264
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">and speak you're not the idea of</font>

265
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,060
standing up in front of six<font color="#E5E5E5"> or eight</font>

hundred drunks at Def Con terrifies you

267
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:58,520
it should but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

268
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,240
someone help you polish your content

269
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,890
your delivery and share an idea with an

270
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,050
audience a manageable size d'audience

271
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,430
get constructive feedback somewhere

272
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,319
where people will correct you if you're

273
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong</font>

274
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,339
but in a conversational way you know

275
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,889
they'll sit down at the party tonight

276
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:18,829
with a beer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you know you should</font>

277
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:21,050
have gone at it this way it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fantastic</font>

278
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:24,229
because that skill is something that you

279
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:26,930
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to function because it turns out</font>

280
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:30,589
that very few organizations have as

281
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,609
their core competency being secure now

282
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,870
they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something else</font>

since before the last event here

321
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:04,339
planning really accelerates it's like

322
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:06,470
every other project in the world you can

323
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:08,389
do the first ninety percent of it in the

324
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,850
14 months before the event and you do

325
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:12,470
the last ninety percent of it in the

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,870
month before<font color="#CCCCCC"> the event and then the</font>

percent the night before

429
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,910
view the world forever right and there

430
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,500
are people like in CERN and

431
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,480
switzerland with a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> doughnut thing</font>

432
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,150
that are shooting adams back and forth

433
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,520
and they're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> disprove newtonian</font>

434
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:56,890
physics and there is nobody on the

435
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,629
planet that once<font color="#CCCCCC"> Newton</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be right more</font>

436
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,730
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are and i'll tell you why i</font>

437
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,860
don't want to stand next to that can do

438
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:05,740
but if Newton was wrong about these

439
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,840
bolts holding together right think about

440
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,060
definitely we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to disprove no</font>

441
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,490
yeah well I'm gonna like back<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a</font>

442
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,500
little bit but so a couple of things

443
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:17,550
that Newton said are fantastic for

444
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,960
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about me sins one which he</font>

445
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:21,430
borrowed from someone else is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

446
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:26,140
I've seen further<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's by standing on</font>

447
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:27,790
the shoulders of giants that's cliche I

448
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,920
want you to stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> and think about what</font>

449
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:33,460
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means in the context of this</font>

450
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:37,110
community that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have the</font>

451
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:39,880
opportunity here to find those shoulders

452
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:43,179
by giants I don't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> giant egos but</font>

453
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,910
people who can give you a foundation you

454
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:51,030
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity to provide</font>

455
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:55,600
shoulders to others take that seriously

456
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:57,910
take what you're given build on it learn

457
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,990
from others and then pass that forward

458
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:03,670
provide shoulders to others<font color="#E5E5E5"> and remember</font>

459
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you are always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> standing on the</font>

460
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:09,160
shoulders of giants everything we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

461
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:11,200
based on somebody else prior history

462
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,620
especially in computer security you know

463
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,230
you start you start rolling back to

464
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:20,830
Grace Hopper and Lady ADA folks like

465
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:22,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's like oh yeah yeah people that</font>

466
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:25,929
did computing by patch cable because

467
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,220
they didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have switches right we're</font>

468
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,050
all standing on somebody else's

469
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:32,500
shoulders<font color="#E5E5E5"> b-sides gives us an</font>

470
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:34,090
opportunity to both stand on shoulders

471
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,650
and provide shoulders for others and

472
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,290
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're standing on</font>

473
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,640
shoulders you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> where soft-soled</font>

474
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:42,010
shoes because you are standing on the

475
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,950
shoulders of others use google and give

476
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,810
people credit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other one that i</font>

477
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,730
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting besides</font>

478
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:51,909
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> there a lot of different things</font>

479
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:54,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening forgive me i don't remember</font>

480
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the full quote but Newton was asked</font>

481
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,400
about his accomplishments late in life

482
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,380
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he said I don't know what I've seen</font>

483
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,630
what I may seem to others

484
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,960
but to myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> I seem as a small boy on</font>

485
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:07,540
the beach<font color="#E5E5E5"> only pausing to look at a</font>

486
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,660
pebble or shell which was shiny or more

487
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:13,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting than the others I was</font>

488
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:16,360
Newton's take on his own life changed

489
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,449
the way we view the world but the

490
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:22,959
passion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that shell or that pebble</font>

491
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:25,810
which distracted Newton was what drove

492
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,420
him where he<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is the kind of</font>

493
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:30,760
event and community where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

494
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,770
that pebble you can find that shell no

495
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,960
matter how strange or esoteric it may be

496
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:37,180
to the rest of the world no<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter how</font>

497
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,160
much your family rolls their eyes when

498
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:42,640
you try to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cool stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

499
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:45,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">learned today this is an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

500
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,590
find that she'll find that pebble and

501
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:49,419
participate and share and that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

502
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,939
got i'm getting all idealistic and crap
