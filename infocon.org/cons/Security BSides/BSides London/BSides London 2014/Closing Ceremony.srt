biggest challenge players last year and

8

he won quite a few things so this year

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,120
he actually volunteered to run the

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,159
challenges with a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> other guys so</font>

he's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> present the challenge</font>

was over<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's be and yes I'm a</font>

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,519
upon for the for the challenges team to

18
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:57,809
keep all the prizes for themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

19
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:59,309
apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give them out so</font>

20
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:01,108

challenge was based on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> final year unit</font>

37
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,160
that we have that it's essentially

<font color="#E5E5E5">malware analysis it's not your sort of</font>

across universities which do<font color="#CCCCCC"> meron</font>

42
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,619

48
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,060
love<font color="#CCCCCC"> it honest I swear they will love it</font>

49
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,760
at least by the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so essentially</font>

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,490
I repurpose the<font color="#CCCCCC"> course work for this</font>

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,700
year's besides challenge it is a botnet

52
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:20,160
or is a was a botnet as it were you were

53
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,109
given<font color="#CCCCCC"> an executable file it connected to</font>

54
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,299
an IRC channel which was a command and

55
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,430
control server and from the IRC channel

56
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,440
you could initiate send commands down to

57
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,000
the bots and get them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things big</font>

58
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,709
thank you to Alec<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all the help he</font>

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,810
gave me an in sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of setting up and</font>

60
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,100
what have you and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> for telling me</font>

61
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was probably a bad idea to let</font>

62
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,760
participants control each other's

63
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,130
computers and insert stuff onto the onto

64
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,170
their things so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got two</font>

65
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,090
winners<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will just say the quality of</font>

66
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,700
the submissions<font color="#CCCCCC"> was extremely high</font>

67
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,320
having entered a competition I think one

68
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,060
of the b-sides challenges last year I

69
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">think I wrote half a paragraph and</font>

70
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,930
thought that would secure me<font color="#CCCCCC"> the prize</font>

71
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,910
most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> submissions were in excess</font>

72
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,830
of 10 pages and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> quality was</font>

73
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,989
extremely high I was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very impressed</font>

74
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:08,160
so it's very well deserved to the two

75
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:10,530
winners win of the book is a live you

76
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,030
who was presented today he's had<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

77
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:16,050
book already because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he had to go early</font>

78
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:18,480
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> second-place winner you know I</font>

79
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,709
want a ticket but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he couldn't come so I</font>

80
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,030
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it someone else and I</font>

81
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">already had one and I tried to you to</font>

82
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,810
someone else and yeah where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you had one</font>

83
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,300
so we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a million</font>

84
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,050
second-place entries all of whom were

85
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,520
here

86
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:34,950
hope thank you no no this is for this is

87
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:39,260
the second one so it's all very

88
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,260
confusing all will become clear

89
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:46,859
challenge to was from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> kpmg by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Antony</font>

90
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cox and putting the prize in to surprise</font>

91
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:54,180
the prize is another copy of frantic um

92
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:56,310
how we're analysis and yeah this year's

93
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,140
winner not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only did he did he win the</font>

94
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,480
prize but he's had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do battle with</font>

95
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,869
several countries bureaucracy to be here

96
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:09,920
today tell him his name in a minute but

97
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:12,630
I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have Chris from kpmg hi folks</font>

98
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,489
do for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those who are here at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the at the</font>

99
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:18,420
eleven o'clock talk you know i'm not as

100
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:20,850
as big as Stephan Bonnar I don't dress

101
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,370
up in wigs I don't put makeup on and

102
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,530
I've got no chocolates to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try well</font>

103
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,350
but what I do have in addition until the

104
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,000
wonderful book is an ipad air and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

105
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,490
think that what<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes the story even</font>

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,919
more sweet is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a winner in this</font>

107
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:39,210
year and he apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> one last year too</font>

108
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:41,659
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what what couldn't happen was he</font>

109
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:45,299
couldn't come over because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> various</font>

110
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:48,000
visas and what have you and on this year

111
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,120
he<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and the wonderful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> part</font>

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,590
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is on the efforts of Paul making</font>

113
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,050
sure that the right authorities were

114
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,669
contacted with the various validations

115
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:01,280
for getting them over we managed to get

116
00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:01,280
a visa in place so that's wonderful news

117
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,550
so

118
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:14,469
in terms of the challenge itself and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

119
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,650
would describe it as nails it was five

120
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:19,030
levels<font color="#E5E5E5"> of encryption and decryption</font>

121
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,799
techniques including some which were a

122
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,950
bit flawed and so much involved

123
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,210
steganography that meant<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

124
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,340
numbers who actually got clothes on

125
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:30,070
right was very few and the man who

126
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:39,900
nailed it in this one is here today and

127
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:39,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great Alexander good stuff</font>

129
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,780
Alexander I'm too much excited that I

130
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">did not expect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything I work as a</font>

others thank you very much<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

137
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:28,080
challenge number three was from mwr this

138
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,690
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most popular challenge this year</font>

139
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,940
had more entries than any others and

140
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,440
it's it's quite clear from the entries

141
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,219
that people put a lot of a lot of

142
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,810
thought and effort into their entries

143
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,729
squeaking every last little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk</font>

176
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:19,169
as if I didn't run enough all day today

177
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:20,638
take anything that's not nailed down all

178
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:24,150
right challenge number 4 we're nearly

179
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,370
there this was by didier Stevens and

180
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,049
anyone who is familiar with the DA's

181
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,260
work will know that he<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a person who</font>

182
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:34,289
is very very familiar with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internals</font>

183
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,599
of various file formats in this case it

184
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,460
was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> docx file and the question that</font>

185
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,219
had to be answered was what is the

186
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,570
create date of this doc file so it's

187
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,810
really a question of looking at the

188
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:48,779
document metadata and the create day

189
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:52,199
differed depending upon which file which

190
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:53,760
program used to open the docx file so

191
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,760
two dates could be extracted that way

192
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,710
and there was a third date which<font color="#E5E5E5"> Didier</font>

193
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,210
crammed in as well and I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

194
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:05,670

started called b-sides in in Vegas and

594
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:25,179

595
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:27,879
be really cool if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start this event</font>

597
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:34,929
and people like Paul and Iggy and Martin

598
