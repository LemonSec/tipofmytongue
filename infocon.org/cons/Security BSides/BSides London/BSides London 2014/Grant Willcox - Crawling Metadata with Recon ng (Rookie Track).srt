1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:15,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">plus we could for lunch hey scram</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hey</font>

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:17,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so my good friend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um so if</font>

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,109
everyone sat down i'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go ahead and</font>

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:23,479
start so today<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll be talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

5
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:27,679
according metadata with a tool i plug in

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:30,109
our develops<font color="#CCCCCC"> I poor week on ng bomb so</font>

7
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:34,730
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is metadata it is anyone in this</font>

8
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:37,610
room not know what metadata is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'll</font>

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:40,220
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> beep the guy but essentially by the</font>

10
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,620
data is any data that can describe the

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:46,400
properties or attributes of another

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:48,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">object so say you have like a ball the</font>

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,930
metadata for that ball might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh it's</font>

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">red or if it was manufactured in China</font>

15
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:58,220
or something like that so essentially

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:00,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's just data describing other data so</font>

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,519
where can you find mate metadata well

18
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,040
you can find it pretty much everywhere

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,590
um this emergence in examples for

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,200
example in libraries vibe users are to

21
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:12,430
actually organize their books in

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:15,440
databases databases used it to organize

23
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">entries that are within it um there's</font>

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,860
metadata in books such as the author<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

25
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:25,339
title where was published the earth was

26
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:27,740
published stuff like that so because

27
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,450
it's such an abstract concept on it

28
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,720
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> into play really interestingly</font>

29
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:36,470
because there's many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different types of</font>

30
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,590
data that metadata can apply to which

31
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:41,240
brings me<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to my next slide so the</font>

32
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,130
audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> are made on the pie will</font>

33
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,320
essentially what i wanted to do the

34
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:48,070
project<font color="#CCCCCC"> started out as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted to</font>

35
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:51,820
develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> open-source alternative to foco</font>

36
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:54,710
does anyone this room not knoweth focus

37
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:57,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll be to explain what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focus focus</font>

38
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,839
is essentially on our online metadata

39
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">quarless so what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do is you type</font>

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,460
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> site right and if will go off and</font>

41
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:07,010
say oh look here's all the publicly

42
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,378
available documents for this site let's

43
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,880
download them extract<font color="#E5E5E5"> their metadata and</font>

44
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:12,649
then we can start forming a map<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we</font>

45
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,220
just from the publicly available

46
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:18,170
documents we can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

47
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:21,770
there's like a windows XP machine

48
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,480
running in the target Network which has

49
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,240
this user on earth which is running this

50
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,679
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have these printers in</font>

51
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,569
the network and you can start building a

52
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,760
really really accurate map of a target

53
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:36,109
corporation just based off with their

54
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,120
public data now the problem is i was

55
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,530
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> develop that sort of tool and</font>

56
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,510
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i realized there was another tool</font>

57
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:45,319
called medical who filled up I does

58
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:47,299
anyone not heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that one which</font>

59
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:51,440
essentially did the same sort of thing

60
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,910
so I spoke to Bob and we saw the started

61
00:02:51,440 --> 00:03:00,220
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what other things can we</font>

62
00:02:52,910 --> 00:03:02,180
do so I decided here neither side um oh

63
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,330
there was meant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an immature I'll</font>

64
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,970
just show you a demo later but

65
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:10,580
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can ngei decided to use</font>

66
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:13,819
it because well it's open source it's

67
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:16,610
modular<font color="#E5E5E5"> in nature and either just decide</font>

68
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:20,238
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use it because if I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expand it</font>

69
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:21,739
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it will allow me to incorporate</font>

70
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,600
the features of other modules and

71
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:26,630
there's already features enabled<font color="#E5E5E5"> within</font>

72
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:30,440
it such as the Bing API which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm using</font>

73
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:33,170
to query<font color="#CCCCCC"> for my results there's already</font>

74
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:36,260
a built-in search engine within so

75
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:38,750
building like method of squaring the bin

76
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:42,048
API that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm able to take advantage of</font>

77
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:44,750
in module so because of these reasons I

78
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:50,060
decided she solid me with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so that</font>

79
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:51,829
can be expanded on later um so yeah this

80
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,500
is what if meta down the pie so that

81
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:58,459
looks like at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so essentially</font>

82
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have an important option are the</font>

83
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:04,280
important option basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll go</font>

84
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:05,750
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and basically say okay well we</font>

85
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">have all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this information in the</font>

86
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,950
documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have but a lot of it</font>

87
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,690
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important so you've got</font>

88
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff like how many pages are in the</font>

89
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:16,488
document or what the document security

90
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,769
is and for typical pentester you don't

91
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:20,328
really need to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so that will</font>

92
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:22,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically filter that information out</font>

93
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:25,580
and only displayed information that's

94
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:28,159
important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> pat test the next options</font>

95
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,620
they taught side option basically

96
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,500
you set the site you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can either specify</font>

97
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:36,440
the ww in front of it or leave it out

98
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,440
its entire op tional my tool if you

99
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,560
can't find the site from this if<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

100
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,140
try to pending ww in front of it and see

101
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,240
if we can beat it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that site next</font>

102
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,969
options the text option basically that

103
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,830
will save the output to a file name if

104
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">you leave it out it will just output</font>

105
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:56,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">onto the screen and lastly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have the</font>

106
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,680
type options so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> several</font>

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,560
different types that can query for right

108
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,840
now right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now the options are doc pedia</font>

109
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">PowerPoint to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> xls</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alternatively you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

110
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,320
specify the all option which will is

111
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:10,730
query then successively one by one so

112
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to try to give her a quick</font>

113
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,640
dinner and pray to them regard to this

114
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:20,290
actually works I have recorded<font color="#CCCCCC"> a video</font>

115
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,289
which I'll briefly try and explain

116
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:43,900
and likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimize the bottom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plc okay</font>

117
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:46,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">ah double clicking here physically okay</font>

118
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:50,349
so yeah essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> uploaded up the week</font>

119
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,840
on ng here and I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can you guys</font>

120
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,340
see that at the back<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so essentially</font>

121
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,239
right now I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just loading up the tool</font>

122
00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:00,969
here arm and we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to show</font>

123
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,520
you options so I'm just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fold</font>

124
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,930
the video a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit because this week</font>

125
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:10,919
let's all have gone through the options

126
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:13,920
here and just kind of skip over this

127
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,920
somewhat

128
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:20,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay oops throwback Roberts I bet</font>

129
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're okay so here basically i'm</font>

130
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,479
running this against home depot calm and

131
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:27,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">query and for the doc files so right now</font>

132
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:28,900
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in saying hey</font>

133
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,340
we're downloading this file this is

134
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,469
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's located if it doesn't</font>

135
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,258
download or if something's on so you can

136
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back and now it's basically just</font>

137
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:39,039
prints out all of these different

138
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,639
documents you can see we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the</font>

139
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,669
operating system if it's the old file

140
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,169
formats this is the doc file format they

141
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:49,419
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a field within it that</font>

142
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:51,310
specifies the specific operating system

143
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:53,770
that was created on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> new xls file</font>

144
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,500
formats don't have that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do have</font>

145
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,990
the application version of the equation

146
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:03,520
software I'll just pause this for five

147
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:06,610
secs you can also see other stuff like

148
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,240
fuel our safety file the author a

149
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:13,719
created<font color="#CCCCCC"> it arm and sort of like the last</font>

150
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,580
save data and create time so that's

151
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:18,969
essentially the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information that</font>

152
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll get for my tool I'll just carry</font>

153
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:21,990
on with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> powerpoints</font>

154
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:30,810
so some of my future<font color="#CCCCCC"> plans are at the</font>

155
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">moment if you have encrypted PDF so if</font>

156
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,360
someone was to encrypt the PDF with a

157
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,120
password right now I can't which I can't

158
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,310
actually like decrypt the file and

159
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,190
extract the metadata without knowing the

160
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:46,020
password itself so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am planning to</font>

161
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,690
potentially add like some basic

162
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,030
dictionary attacks to see if i can

163
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:54,419
actually guess the password um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

164
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:56,760
asked if this is legal or not might one

165
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:59,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">I might try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into that to see if</font>

166
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:02,580
it's actually we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I had it in</font>

167
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:04,500
other things is I had unplanned adds

168
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,289
additional support for file formats

169
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,510
starting with images a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

170
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:12,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">have been asking about that and I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

171
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:14,460
plan to add threading threading at the

172
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,469
moment I've got it into the tool but

173
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,820
it's run so fast that nothing gets

174
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:22,650
downloaded so I do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work on that</font>

175
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:26,400
if anyone's interested in helping<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

176
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:31,109
that please do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not mean ah yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

177
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,549
a major feature on plant add yeah so the

178
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,099
final note is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tool it's not the eye</font>

179
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:38,120
thing recon ng I tried asked him and any

180
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:40,620
basically said well I have a three-week

181
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,770
religious vacation so I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

182
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,660
able to get back to him on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was</font>

183
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:48,990
very interested in the tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> and getting</font>

184
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:51,029
it included but like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said plans being</font>

185
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,529
made to do so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just still being with</font>

186
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:54,529
that at the moment

187
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,810
okay so Robert<font color="#CCCCCC"> Macario is a great mentor</font>

188
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,150
on this just want to give a quick shout

189
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:06,359
at him for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the files will be hosted</font>

190
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:08,430
at here<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be sending out a tweet</font>

191
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,040
from you can check at<font color="#E5E5E5"> tech wheels one</font>

192
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,750
two three and i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> send out a link on</font>

193
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,750
twitter otherwise if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to just</font>

194
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,310
copy that down quickly arm therefore

195
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:21,180
basically be where all the files are

196
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:27,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">hosted until they're included on recon</font>

197
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:27,949
ng so is there any questions

198
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:35,589
how long did it take is going on this

199
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:39,250
project it took on and off about three

200
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:41,470
months arm a lot of it was actually

201
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:44,470
taking from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> medic who filled up I</font>

202
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,870
code which was open source that I was

203
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:50,079
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of copy something occurred</font>

204
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:52,209
across but this was actually university

205
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,310
research project and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I decided to</font>

206
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:59,920
expand it and poured it into recon

207
00:09:54,310 --> 00:10:02,380
energy with fire for mercy's for file

208
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,610
formats at the moment or<font color="#E5E5E5"> doc so I did</font>

209
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,720
try and cover that but I don't know if

210
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:11,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">or when she first it's doc PDFs xos</font>

211
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:14,950
formats and powerpoints I was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

212
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,459
support which text format files but

213
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:22,019
there's not enough metadata to really

214
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:24,399
support that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sir taking support our fort</font>

215
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:27,730
like an open-source search engine like

216
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,810
you saved what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by that is that</font>

217
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:34,959
like why AC wives were sort of search

218
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:36,699
tools adjust as well crawling has a

219
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,439
different case of my hat

220
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,440
is it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> collecting more metadata</font>

221
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:46,600
you're gonna have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a bit more</font>

222
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:50,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific on that like it it does collect</font>

223
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:53,470
metadata but sometimes I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't</font>

224
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:56,860
know to come across<font color="#E5E5E5"> that project why I</font>

225
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:58,960
see why don't know haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something</font>

226
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,280
you've seen it I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk different</font>

227
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine what's going to be on his list</font>

228
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:07,569
now yeah you're ahead is built in Jonna

229
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:11,290
and I got some<font color="#CCCCCC"> similar things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's</font>

230
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:14,850
my career fair open source section<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

231
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:17,589
fully pulled why you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> why is you see</font>

232
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,890
if you're totally got crawled as we

233
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,890
speak

234
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:30,110
don't let us hi guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are formats you can</font>

235
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:32,810
see sorry can you speak up a bit gasps

236
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:36,079
huge for file format is it going guys

237
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:41,329
for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> stolen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sighs extracting from</font>

238
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:43,969
there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to like the archives of</font>

239
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:48,260
the site do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mean like the café's</font>

240
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:52,550
results or caches or<font color="#E5E5E5"> youngstarr high</font>

241
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:54,500
stockings insights as some sites like

242
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:57,500
zip files<font color="#E5E5E5"> or our files containing a</font>

243
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,030
whole line real documents or say can be

244
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,330
called

245
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:03,280
that was something you implement so like

246
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,890
implementing extract metadata from

247
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,720
archives<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the artists technology</font>

248
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,610
suggested that might be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good idea to</font>

249
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:15,910
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to implement I'll see if I can get</font>

250
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:17,970
that implementing any loss well thank

251
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font>
