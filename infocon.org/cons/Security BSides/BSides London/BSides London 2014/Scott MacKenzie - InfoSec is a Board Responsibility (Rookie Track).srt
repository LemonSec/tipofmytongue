2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,309
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you today about why infosecurity</font>

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,650
there's a board-level responsibility so

4
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:17,880
basically quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> Who am I I'm logical</font>

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:26,310
step C so I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology also an MBA</font>

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:28,259
graduate and qualified cissp yeah most

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,049
of my time spent and consulting doing

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,530
enterprise security architecture i'm

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:38,390
also an MSC student<font color="#E5E5E5"> part time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at Royal</font>

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:41,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">Holloway</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing information security so</font>

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,890
I'm moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> on so today basically I want</font>

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,020
to talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all about why infosec is</font>

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,329
a governance issue it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an IT</font>

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,440
function basically who your target

15
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:56,219
audience is and it's--<font color="#E5E5E5"> well what the</font>

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:00,390
problem is how you actually sell the

17
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:02,550
problem to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the board and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compliance and</font>

18
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,979
the board's responsibilities and to

19
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,670
conclude basically with why it comes

20
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,670
down to board's responsibility

21
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:15,210
Oh Betty Sutton the<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the boards and</font>

22
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,360
the senior management comprised of an

23
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,580
awful lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> non-technical people you've</font>

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">got financial director sales and</font>

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,850
marketing HR none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them generally have</font>

26
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,310
a strong background in technology so I'm

27
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,179
with a few exceptions of a technology

28
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:36,570
companies so basically over the past two

29
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,270
decades and technology has become more

30
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,100
more key to doing business in 21st

31
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,729
century you can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> business without</font>

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,080
technology and so that's why

33
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:49,650
confidentiality integrity and

34
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:53,370
availability of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> information is</font>

35
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:56,570
critical but information<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

36
00:01:53,370 --> 00:02:02,060
information security require investment

37
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:02,059
invest money time and resources

38
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,920
so for the good of the organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

39
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:09,818
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically have time convince</font>

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,970
uninterested senior management

41
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:16,230
uninterested directors to commit

42
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:20,730
resources and funding so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can</font>

43
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,730
apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to your security projects</font>

44
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:27,840
no bc understanding how we do it and

45
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,690
there's needs in this once now

46
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,340
originally there was song called Maslow

47
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:36,150
who came up with his hierarchy of needs

48
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,310
on the earth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was further built</font>

49
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,650
upon by someone called them Hertzberg

50
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,320
Cuban hunters hygiene factors<font color="#E5E5E5"> since the</font>

51
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,960
UH needs are our basic requirements our

52
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:49,560
food our water our shelter<font color="#CCCCCC"> our once on</font>

53
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,500
the other hand are what we really want

54
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,690
our high-end cars are big houses

55
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,610
essential so there's nice simple acronym

56
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:00,260
that was produced for sales<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

57
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:03,330
marketing people call later<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is</font>

58
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,640
attention you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to cap the capture</font>

59
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,430
your audience's attention first of all

60
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,600
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to get them interested once</font>

61
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,170
you've got their attention get them

62
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:17,130
build their<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest up and then develop</font>

63
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:21,119
desire for your product so once you've

64
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:23,340
got that then action begins<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can sell</font>

65
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">that product</font>

66
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,519
to the board a quick example few years

67
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:33,090
back I was working somewhere we only had

68
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,120
pix firewalls in place and I had to

69
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,090
convince them why we needed to set up a

70
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,250
DMZ<font color="#CCCCCC"> when we be place where the service</font>

71
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,620
company were<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also had to convince them</font>

72
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,660
why when they'd only ever use pics there

73
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,299
we needed to choose the firewall from

74
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,190
different vendor to put on the perimeter

75
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:52,069
so I ran through essentially that same

76
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,209
process I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just gone through there and</font>

77
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:56,548
eventually convince the senior

78
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,829
management and got the funding<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

79
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:01,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">resources necessary in order to</font>

80
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:05,790
implement firewall some separate vendors

81
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:08,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the perimeter so basically further</font>

82
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,140
moving on we've got them got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ensure</font>

83
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,150
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you present your senior</font>

84
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,708
management to your board that what

85
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,540
you're presenting to them is for either

86
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,668
called board talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather than tech talk</font>

87
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,349
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to hear lots and lots of</font>

88
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:20,728
three-letter acronyms they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

89
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,590
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about sequel to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jackson tax</font>

90
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:23,820
cross-site scripting I don't want to

91
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,830
know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether you should be using</font>

92
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,020
cipher block chaining or cipher feedback

93
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,270
mode on your ciphers your equip<font color="#E5E5E5"> shin</font>

94
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,270
what the board is generally concerned

95
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:36,719
about is their sales they link on the

96
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,849
top line their gross income they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

97
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">know about the return investment they</font>

98
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:44,820
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the quality of the product</font>

99
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:46,289
or service of delivery now what do it

100
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,150
very interested that they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> concerned</font>

101
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:51,450
about risk and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a key area where</font>

102
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:54,299
you can sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> in for security and dealing</font>

103
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">with it mitigating it and they're also</font>

104
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,120
concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the cash flow making</font>

105
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,669
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's enough money for the</font>

106
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,990
projects of running around and then

107
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:03,539
interesting what their competitors are

108
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:07,169
doing yeah and the other thing that

109
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:10,020
concerns the goal the board is legal and

110
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:12,060
regulatory compliance depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on which</font>

111
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,070
jurisdiction in the world you're working

112
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,340
in you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ensure you comply with</font>

113
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:19,130
the local laws

114
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:24,138
so the challenge you want to basically

115
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:27,590
be able to sell them and the benefits

116
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:29,750
not just the features so by that they do

117
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,690
the board don't want to know every

118
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,770
different then parameter<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dikhla firewall</font>

119
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,680
I don't want to know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

120
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,840
throughput etc etc but they want to know

121
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,070
it's what it gives them how it helps

122
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,840
them do their job how it helps the

123
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:46,849
company to make money what the bottom

124
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:49,250
line<font color="#CCCCCC"> is so people by the benefits not</font>

125
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:52,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the features and the three little words</font>

126
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:55,100
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use to sell that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those three</font>

127
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:58,700
little words are which<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that so a</font>

128
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:01,250
quick example up here and imagine secure

129
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">3,000 IPS you're trying to sell them</font>

130
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:07,700
this updates it signatures every 30

131
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:10,159
minutes and which means that the company

132
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:16,479
will have rapid detection from zero-day

133
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:19,250
attacks so the Hat basic human nature

134
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,260
people are drawn to people send it to

135
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,050
themselves just one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those unwritten</font>

136
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:26,570
rules and now the senior<font color="#E5E5E5"> management I'm</font>

137
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,800
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily going to need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

138
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,169
about the extent of your technical

139
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,750
knowledge it can even be off-putting to

140
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:34,639
them so you need to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> across to</font>

141
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,960
certain extent as one of them you're

142
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,750
pitching to them

143
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,729
so make sure you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using open questions</font>

144
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,220
too don't just look for something<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

145
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:44,659
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you a yes or no answer</font>

146
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,520
better ask them something that's going

147
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:51,190
to give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> an idea or give you an idea</font>

148
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:53,090
of their objectives their advantages

149
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,530
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're once are there are</font>

150
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,669
attitudes and needs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how that can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

151
00:06:54,530 --> 00:07:02,448
integrated over all so I don't oversell

152
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:05,210
your risk really you'll get away with it

153
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:06,740
once and get investment if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

154
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,000
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> off and its cost them a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of money</font>

155
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:13,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're not going to take you seriously</font>

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">again keep it real and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when you pitch</font>

157
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,110
something to them listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them ask</font>

158
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,500
some questions watch their responses

159
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:24,139
watch their body language<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of</font>

160
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,270
critical and questions coming back from

161
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:27,470
their good look for the questions that

162
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,090
means they're actually paying attention

163
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:34,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">to what you're trying to sell them so</font>

164
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:36,380
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> back over now what their</font>

165
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:41,000
interests in regulated compliance this

166
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:44,060
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really key because you pick anywhere</font>

167
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,990
within itom for sec where you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

168
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:51,320
compliance requirement so good example

169
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:53,690
is the UK data protection act you need

170
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,940
to need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what's required and did a</font>

00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at have a look at what the company</font>

172
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,930
is currently doing do a quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> gap</font>

173
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,719
analysis there once you understand that

174
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:05,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you understand the cost is going to</font>

175
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:06,520
involve to meet that gap analysis then

176
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,770
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take your proposal to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the board</font>

177
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,289
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very critical</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because serious</font>

178
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,599
breaches of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DPA can result in</font>

179
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:16,219
companies being fined for large sums of

180
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:18,580
money up to about half a million pound I

181
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:18,580
think now

182
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:26,820
exam unless the organization is going to

183
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:29,680
take a top-down approach to basically

184
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:32,289
pushing through the objectives the

185
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:37,990
changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> then it's leaving itself open to</font>

186
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:40,539
lots and lots of serious that's see it

187
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,820
is part of their the balls<font color="#E5E5E5"> governance so</font>

188
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:45,670
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a board-level responsibility</font>

189
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,960
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board's decide what are the key</font>

190
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,180
information assets within this

191
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,750
organization they decide how much you

192
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to protect those and they also</font>

193
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,760
control the funds in the investment and

194
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:00,420
projects so they have to be the ones

195
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:05,200
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point and prioritize various</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stem</font>

196
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:06,969
initiatives also the belt the board is

197
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,920
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> responsible for pushing out</font>

198
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:12,730
cultural change within your organization

199
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,290
and if anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes really wrong the</font>

200
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,230
board are going to be held accountable

201
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:21,569
and in some cases they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to step down</font>

202
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:24,310
if it's a serious intersect bridge so

203
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:27,040
looking quickly at the regulation again

204
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:29,380
whichever jurisdiction you're operating

205
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,650
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this organization there's various</font>

206
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:35,770
compliance requirements so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be</font>

207
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:39,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">ISO 27001 they might be the data</font>

208
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:41,350
protection<font color="#E5E5E5"> act in UK government systems</font>

209
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,390
it might be a Djinn geez IAS 1 in

210
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:47,440
ministry of<font color="#CCCCCC"> defense you've got your JSP</font>

211
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:50,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">446 of that over in the state you've got</font>

212
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:54,100
for medical you've got HIPAA compliance

213
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,780
and cetera so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically the the risks</font>

214
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,750
are there you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to comply with them</font>

215
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:02,069
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned before and the DPA fines</font>

216
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:04,170
up to 500,000<font color="#CCCCCC"> and for serious breaches</font>

217
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:07,060
so the board has to be proactive

218
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:10,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">mandating any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information security</font>

219
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:14,119
changes to go through

220
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,950
so to conclude if no one else wanted the

221
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,670
information asset it wouldn't really be

222
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:21,620
an asset you need to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

223
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,819
confidentiality is maintained you need

224
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,460
to ensure the integrity of the

225
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:27,080
informations there and you need to

226
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,450
ensure that's available only to the

227
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,040
people who need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to access it it is a</font>

228
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,230
governance responsibilities of the broad

229
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,730
it does require a top-down approach to

230
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:42,710
implement and you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really sell</font>

231
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:45,040
it to them in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get achieved any</font>

232
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,040
questions

233
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:51,699
okay and you say the board care most

234
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:54,010
about revenue and profits so how do you

235
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:57,340
tie deeply technical projects such as

236
00:10:54,010 --> 00:11:00,310
new ideas system or new firewalls into

237
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:04,170
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they care about</font>

238
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:08,050
and you need to sell to them basically

239
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:09,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the benefits of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that lovely what</font>

240
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,979
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> it do to the company if you</font>

241
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:15,339
implement it you know of its features

242
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:18,100
you know that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anthea might be able</font>

243
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:20,140
to detect signatures in real time and it

244
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,089
might and block those drop those

245
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,529
particular packets but they're not going

246
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:24,640
to buy that they're not going to

247
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:28,510
understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

248
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,880
there and a tu off to say to them if we

249
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,560
set these up on our perimeter if we can

250
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,630
stop attacks before the end of our

251
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,630
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much benefit will that give</font>

252
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:40,060
us how much how much will that prevent

253
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:42,610
and a drop of productivity across our

254
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:45,189
stuff that's the sort of angle you need

255
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:50,690
to be looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at to try and sell that to</font>

256
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:54,500
them anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

257
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:56,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's go beyond what to avoid coming</font>

258
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,720
aboard go to that with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really bad</font>

259
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:07,520
brutal only spending<font color="#CCCCCC"> just enough to take</font>

260
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:09,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">the boxes with wires and sometimes it's</font>

261
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,660
worth setting up a demo if you can do if

262
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,210
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time the cost development</font>

263
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:16,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">here that that's a one way of</font>

264
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:20,630
approaching it or look at other case

265
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:23,719
studies we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> only taking off to PCI DSS</font>

266
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:26,630
list meant that they were still breached

267
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,690
and there was lots of reputational

268
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,689
damage

269
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay how do you explain the risk where</font>

270
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:42,149
nothing bad has happened I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to get</font>

271
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">that won't happen to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

272
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:51,490
okay and there's a you can once again

273
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:54,099
take an example and I'll rephrase it

274
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:57,010
slightly in I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that before in</font>

275
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:01,360
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> man manufacturing industry they</font>

276
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:03,819
were producing and bolts and that were

277
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,200
for an upstream supply contact now they

278
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,320
said no one's going to care about our

279
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,060
systems what we do is produce bolts for

280

manufacturing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here but they didn't</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">realize was they those components</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">for their aircraft maker manufacture</font>

284
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:23,170
because their security was laps and

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,430
people in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there they knew the specs of</font>

286
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,110
those both suddenly they knew the

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,569
tolerance of those and from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

288
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:31,540
could infer the tongs and requirements

289
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:33,160
of the aircraft and that was quite a

290
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:37,060
serious security breach when you look at

291
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:40,240
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way so you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look for</font>

292
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,199
examples and sell them examples of some

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,710
of the features and sell them the
