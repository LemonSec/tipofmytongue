00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:08,130
hi I'm Steve Lord and some of you may

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,719
have seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> me on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter our apologize in</font>

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,349
advance for not looking like my twitter

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,700
avatar but most people are grateful that

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:20,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wear more clothes than my twitter</font>

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,810
avatar and in case you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know me</font>

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,000
which is probably most<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in this</font>

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,310
room I'd like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you a bit</font>

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,210
about myself the obligatory<font color="#CCCCCC"> once lied</font>

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,189
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> me so I test pens a small but</font>

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,989
perfectly formed pen testing company and

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,850
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> co-organized a small event called</font>

13
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,599
44.com that a few people turn up to now

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">and again I also run a little blog which</font>

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a blog that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> teaches people how to pen</font>

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,890
test but this talk isn't about any of

17
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,419
those things instead this talk is about

18
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,309
some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that affect us all</font>

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,270
and will affect us all going forward and

20
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:59,059
you know basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like to think about</font>

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:04,619
IOT as a solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> in search of a problem</font>

22
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:06,840
but one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most important things</font>

23
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,840
about IOT is its ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change lives</font>

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,390
for good with meaningful things that

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,880
really matter it can really affect

26
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,100
people so you know we have over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,360
smart plate which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> backed by signs how</font>

28
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,979
does it work it's backed by science

29
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,920
smart socks because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't want you</font>

30
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,090
like many priests I'm not priests they

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,740
wouldn't let me in they said I was too

32
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:33,060
corrupt but like many priests I always I

33
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,829
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel that you like the really</font>

34
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,560
black socks not the dark<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue ones but</font>

35
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,149
the really dark black ones and then of

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">course there's the egg minder as a smart</font>

37
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">egg tray which is my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> favorite IOT device</font>

38
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,270
a device so smart that people who made

39
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,659
it couldn't come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with a use case for</font>

40
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,658
it

41
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,160
but they still<font color="#CCCCCC"> managed to sell it to</font>

42
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,530
another company who also couldn't come

43
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,259
up with the use case for it there's

44
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">something very similar to IOT and it's</font>

45
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,000
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry and it's the thing that</font>

46
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:06,080
I like to call the cider industrial

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,240
complex which is a lot like two guys

48
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,660
fighting each other trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to argue the</font>

49
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,570
loudest over whose solution is the best

50
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:17,630
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality is that there are actual</font>

51
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:21,049
real threats that are facing<font color="#CCCCCC"> us inside a</font>

52
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:24,620
space for example i'm defending cider

53
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:30,290
space now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have two cans for redundancy</font>

54
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:36,830
purposes but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are many threats to</font>

55
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:39,890
side a space<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for example there are</font>

56
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:44,209
bad things inside a space which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is good</font>

57
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:45,619
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me because i like bad things but</font>

58
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:48,110
some of these bad things that we're

59
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:51,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at now our side of weapons that</font>

60
00:02:48,110 --> 00:03:01,459
could seriously affect the quality of

61
00:02:51,080 --> 00:03:04,610
our cider but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we were to mix the</font>

62
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:06,500
side of weapons of tomorrow with the

63
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:13,130
quality assurance processes over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

64
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:18,860
internet of things with literally no

65
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:20,510
budget what could we achieve and it's an

66
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:27,560
intersection<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the two i like to call</font>

67
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:31,399
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet of wrongs which are devices</font>

68
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:35,000
that are incredibly petty would still

69
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:38,540
constitute cider weapons now everything

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to do in this talk is crap</font>

71
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:44,390
in some cases almost literally but all

72
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,340
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to show you</font>

73
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,589
today use frameworks that are pretty

74
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,569
easy to pick up and you could easily

75
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,760
build your own things we hardware

76
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:53,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">implants things to change stuff and I'm</font>

77
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,149
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to go through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some different</font>

78
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,060
technologies and talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some things</font>

79
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that have happened in my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quest for</font>

80
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,329
discovering the journey into junk

81
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:07,488
hacking for bad stuff or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet of</font>

82
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:10,819
wrongs so I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to a</font>

83
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:13,870
happier time for some a couple of years

84
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:17,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago I tried to move to Berlin and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> failed</font>

85
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:22,520
um very clearly I'm not Apple bow me

86
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:24,560
enough but this is mark but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

87
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,330
really mark I've changed names to

88
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,400
protect the innocent here so let's

89
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,729
pretend this is mark now mark lives with

90
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,849
my friend Vinnie in Berlin also not it

91
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:36,139
not his real name<font color="#CCCCCC"> was stayin at Vinnie's</font>

92
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:38,750
because I was bouncing back and forth

93
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:40,220
between Berlin and one day mark comes

94
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,830
back from paris with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> brand new shiny</font>

95
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,900
macbook and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he says you know i really</font>

96
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,699
like this macbook i had a lenovo there's

97
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,289
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with it you know all i</font>

98
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:50,030
had was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a zillion different</font>

99
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:52,699
variants of candy crush and the thing

100
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:55,070
was as slow as a dog and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd get an hour</font>

101
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:57,800
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> battery life out of it but the</font>

102
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,630
macbook what i can do is i can leave on

103
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,880
charge overnight<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can wake up in the</font>

104
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:05,630
morning go into the living room have my

105
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:08,780
breakfast nothing plugged in go home so

106
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:11,570
we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my bedroom close the lid</font>

107
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,969
go off to work come back from work in

108
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,680
the evening open the lid and it's got

109
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:20,870
ninety five percent of his battery left

110
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:23,030
that's why max a superior so after Vinny

111
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,349
and I realized that mark doesn't

112
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,080
understand the concept of power

113
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:31,849
management we thought could we educate

114
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,380
him with a practical joke a practical

115
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:38,030
joke that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would go horribly horribly</font>

116
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:41,419
wrong now I took it as an opportunity to

117
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:44,109
engage what I like to call the side

118
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:44,109
accrual chain

119
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:51,060
any resemblance to<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that's been</font>

120
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:53,818
put out<font color="#E5E5E5"> by anybody else is purely and</font>

121
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,699
totally coincidental but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> site</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okrill</font>

122
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:59,729
chain consists of sitting on a bench

123
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:01,349
drinking cider watching the thing that

124
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:03,090
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out in this case we</font>

125
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:04,770
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to sit on a bench and we'd</font>

126
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,469
already drunk a<font color="#E5E5E5"> load a side of me and</font>

127
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,599
Vinny and we decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we were</font>

128
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,460
going to do was<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and do something to</font>

129
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:15,259
his<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop to make the power savings</font>

130
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:18,180
fail in a way that would cause hilarity

131
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:21,000
weaponization so we need to develop a

132
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">cider weapon which is hard when you're</font>

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,930
drunk if you've ever tried cooking when

134
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:26,639
you're drunk<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> writing code when</font>

135
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,580
you're drunk and you try building

136
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,319
hardware when you're drunk delivery

137
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,599
which was relatively easy because we

138
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,360
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> already in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Vinny and marks flat and</font>

139
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:38,280
we already<font color="#E5E5E5"> had access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to vinian marks</font>

140
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,560
Wi-Fi network and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already had</font>

141
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,919
physical access to marks laptop for most

142
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,680
of the day but exploitation was

143
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,080
potentially quite difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font>

144
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,029
didn't know marked password and he's the

and pound him a few weeks beforehand

00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:03,479
when he said I bet<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't hack into</font>

device well that's going to be

152
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,099
potentially shaky and this is where we

153
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:16,500
were too drunk to carry on<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

155
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:23,969
control yep grossly went wrong there

156
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,940
this was the fatal flaw and actions on

157
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:29,159

158
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,979
speak is a way of saying did we get the

00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:33,389
effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we wanted to achieve so we</font>

160
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:35,190
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

161
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:37,800
we could do some stuff to play with

162
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:40,379
marks laptop we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought maybe we could</font>

163
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,719
hack into his laptop itself to some

00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:44,699
extra school extra cool neat stuff on<font color="#CCCCCC"> OS</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">X no one ever hacks OS X is gotta be</font>

166
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:51,120
secure and then we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> mm maybe you</font>

167
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,800
might notice that maybe you might find

168
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,210
something like caffeine installed and

169
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,639
remove it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so whatever we took a part is</font>

170
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,299
laptop and then disconnected different

171
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,129
bits response

172
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,259
for power saving and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> like well I</font>

173
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:03,620
could cause some permanent damage if

174
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:05,580
you've ever tried opening a macbook

175
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,650
without the right tools you can also

176
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,000
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it very difficult to reassemble and</font>

177
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:12,179
I didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for macbook so in</font>

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,970
the end we went for wake-on-lan now

179
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,129
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac has support for wake-on-lan</font>

180
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,409
not every wireless network has support

181
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:21,300
for wake-on-lan and the reason for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

182
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:24,270
is the way that wake-on-lan works it's a

183
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:27,080
very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol and in Macworld all</font>

184
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:29,729
you do is you just send a Datagram

185
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,770
that's UDP with a destination port of

186
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:33,630
nine you send it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the broadcast IP and</font>

187
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,949
mac address there's a sink stream the

188
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,969
payload at the start that's just a load

189
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:41,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">of and then the target mac address 16</font>

190
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,300
times quite why it 16 times I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

191
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,019
it's just something to do with the spec

192
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:48,750
but realistically if you look at apple

193
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:50,640
remote desktop which is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple admin</font>

194
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,529
utility it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a remote desktop</font>

195
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,850
this is the type of packet that it would

196
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,130
send out and you'll be able to see up

197
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,410
here you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the sink stream you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

198
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,450
see the mac address repeated it's just a

199
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,920
single Datagram it's really easy it's

200
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,050
really lame is really weak so this is

201
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,089
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a great practical joke the</font>

202
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,609
plan is simple is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just go and</font>

203
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:10,649
send wake-on-lan packets to his<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop</font>

204
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,690
and it will just stay awake the battery

205
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:15,029
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> run down what could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possibly go</font>

206
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:20,520
wrong and you will be surprised Oh

207
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:23,490
viewer now because I was bouncing

208
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,810
between London and Berlin<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot I didn't</font>

209
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a lot of stuff so I had</font>

210
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,979
with me a macbook and I didn't feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

211
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,550
was appropriate to take out a macbook

212
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:38,850
with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> macbook but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also had an Arduino</font>

213
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:40,920
and a dicc<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3000 Wi-Fi shield so if you</font>

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,170
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put one of these things you need</font>

215
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,029
an Arduino Uno r3 which is about eight

216

pound fifty off<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazon you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buy them</font>

217
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:50,100
for cheaper from Aliexpress and you'll

218
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:53,610
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a TI CC 3000 shield which is about</font>

219
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,050
30 quid but realistically if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was to do</font>

220
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,339
it again I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would use a completely</font>

221
00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:00,089
different set of microcontrollers

222
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:01,980
probably an esp8266 which is a much

223
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:06,000
lower cost package that has Wi-Fi built

224
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:08,240
in and this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks like which</font>

225
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,499
is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I fished it out this morning</font>

226
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,069
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like</font>

227
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:17,189
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software that we use is the</font>

228
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:19,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">Arduino IDE which you get from arduino</font>

CC there's multiple versions but the CC

230
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:29,459
version is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the genuine no support the</font>

231
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:31,649
Adafruit CC 3000 library and you're good

232
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:33,959
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course if you to use your own</font>

233
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:36,719
wireless device you probably use an

234
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,829
esp8266 or would wire it<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arduino</font>

235
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:40,049
now because it's cheaper<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

236
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:41,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't need that CC 3000 library</font>

237
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:45,389
instead you need to communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:58,289
cool farold amount of you arduino uses a

242
00:10:55,189 --> 00:11:00,149
simplified superset of C so it's see all

243
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:01,829
the way down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then there are extra</font>

244
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:04,019
things to handle<font color="#CCCCCC"> things like string</font>

handling and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's generally</font>

246
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:08,279
considered quite hard for beginners<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

247
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:09,869
there are two main functions in what's

00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:12,059
called an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arduino sketch that is an</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Arduino program the first one is called</font>

00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:16,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">set</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up which is where you set all the</font>

251
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:18,358
bits up you set your pins to be input or

252
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:19,679
output and then how they're going to

253
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:22,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">communicate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the other bits like</font>

254
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,819
this Wi-Fi module and then you pass over

255
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:27,019
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a loop function which is just</font>

256
00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:32,189
something that loops around continuously

257
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:34,859
so the code is relatively simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> all is</font>

258
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:37,019
is if I may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nicked this from a</font>

259
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:38,879
sample thing and bastardized it for my

260
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:41,189
own means I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's quite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

261
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,809
while ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you just define various</font>

262
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:46,139
security settings for the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

263
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:48,719
going to connect to and then you tell

264
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:49,829
the CC<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3000 to delete any save profile</font>

265
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,720
so it doesn't connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the wrong</font>

266
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:53,909
network and then tell it to connect to

267
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,099
yours get an IP address it's all fairly

268
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:59,279
simple and then in the loop all I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

269
00:11:56,099 --> 00:12:01,379
was I had a little Wi-Fi status thing

270
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,970
that would feed me an update / cereal

271
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:05,909
because the connection kept dropping a

272
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:08,129
problem it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was easily solved by moving</font>

273
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:11,549
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arduino from the top of Vinny's bed</font>

274
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:15,509
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom of Vinny's bed and then</font>

275
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:17,699
you're pretty much good to go the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual</font>

276
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:19,889
code itself is tiny it's really easy to

277
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:21,899
build something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this realistically</font>

278
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:24,400
you could probably do this in a lunch

279
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:28,120
break but because Vinny and I would

280
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:30,250
monk it took hers most of a day and then

281
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next day actually a load of stuff</font>

282
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,900
didn't work so by the time I'd got<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

283
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,270
finished Mark had already gone to work

284
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:41,470
his laptop was there but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to go and</font>

00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:44,110
get a flight the resulting packets look

286
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,610
like this and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I looked at</font>

287
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,930
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we thought well there's no real</font>

288
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,720
way to tell other than the fact that

289
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,069
marks macbooks on but we've pushed the

290
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,870
button on<font color="#E5E5E5"> there to switch it on so we</font>

291
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,060
can't tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got go at the airport</font>

292
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,640
packets look okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be back in two</font>

293
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">weeks that'll be fine should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

294
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:03,720
and the kind of reaction we were hoping

295
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get from art with something like this</font>

296
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:14,290
it's a great great practical joke

297
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:17,920
nothing could ever go wrong the problem

298
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:20,319
with this is I'm a<font color="#CCCCCC"> douche bag so</font>

299
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,050
remember that cyber cruel chain bit that

300
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,810
c2 bit I had no way to shut this thing

301
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,910
off because i thought the obvious way to

302
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,790
shut it off<font color="#E5E5E5"> would beat you unplug it</font>

303
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:34,800
after all be back in two<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks so that</font>

304
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:37,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">first week mart went to the apple store</font>

305
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:41,500
saying that the power management on his

306
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:45,180
apple sucks the apple store had a look

307
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,180
they couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the problem</font>

308
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:55,070
tomorrow at home and his macbook was

309
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:57,969
still messed up mission accomplished

310
00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:01,150
right our side a weapon is successful

311
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:04,160
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vinnie's had a family emergency and</font>

312
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,900
he had to go back to England for family

313
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,550
emergencies two weeks later I go back to

314
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:12,220
Berlin and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I stay somewhere else and</font>

315
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:19,449
Vinny and I forget about this device in

316
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:25,190
the interim mark went to the apple store

317
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:27,050
he said my macbook is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kaput the apple</font>

318
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,550
store kept the macbook overnight it was

00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:31,520
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred percent charge when he left</font>

320
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:34,370
the next day he comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> back it's about</font>

321
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,720
ninety-five percent charged it's all

322
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:39,650

323
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:44,500
fantastic I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to head home so you</font>

324
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:44,500

325
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:58,489
following week<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vinnie still in England</font>

326
00:14:51,910 --> 00:15:03,860
goes back and he says my macbook hist

327
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:05,680
sacker<font color="#CCCCCC"> poop and they said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

328
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,450
actually taken a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it twice</font>

329
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,699
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing wrong with it can't</font>

330
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:13,490
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do anything about it and there</font>

331
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,770
was a back-and-forth and apparently mark

332
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,190
was getting further and further

333
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:20,780
exasperated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this and in the end</font>

334
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:24,740
might went to the apple store<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

335
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:27,430
said because we've had it overnight and

336
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:30,860
found nothing wrong we can't swap it out

337
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:34,219
we can't give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a refund because it's</font>

338
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:37,640
all working but if you were to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

339
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,560
apple store<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you bought it from then</font>

340
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,120
you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go and possibly</font>

341
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,520
convince them because they won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

342
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,770
that we've kept it overnight so<font color="#E5E5E5"> mark</font>

343
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,770
went to the apple store in Paris

344
00:15:53,049 --> 00:16:01,730
and he said excuse him<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11 macbook no</font>

345
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:06,619
marche pas excuse me my macbook doesn't

346
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:14,899
work and they said no problem we'll keep

347
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:18,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">it overnight so he got a hotel and they</font>

348
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:27,489
kept it overnight sure enough it was

349
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:27,489
fine mark went home six months later I

350
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:37,040
went to Berlin and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I stayed at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Vinnie's</font>

351
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:39,230
and I walked<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the living room the</font>

352
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,679
marks there and he doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

353
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:47,059
macbook I said what happened and he said

354
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:50,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">well you know Steve ever since you came</font>

355
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:53,059
last<font color="#CCCCCC"> time my macbook's been totally on</font>

356
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:55,220
the fritz it just doesn't work the

357
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:56,899
battery life<font color="#E5E5E5"> is terrible so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to</font>

358
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">share the macbook to some other</font>

359
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:02,319
unsuspecting chump and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i bought a</font>

360
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:02,319
fucking death

361
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:14,889
there are some important takeaways from

362
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:19,418
this firstly CC 3000 shields are

363
00:17:14,888 --> 00:17:20,888
expensive I think there's a moral

364
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:24,159
question somewhere in there I have

365
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:26,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">trouble distinguishing it but</font>

366
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:29,889
realistically we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> only use cider</font>

367
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,659
for good not for evil and we should

368
00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:34,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">always remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the side to kill train</font>

369
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:36,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">crow chain because ultimately if there</font>

370
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,080
was a way to remotely switch this off if

371
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,908
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was pinging a box I on there was a</font>

372
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,379
chance I could have remembered and gone

373
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:46,000
oh shit<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I couldn't and consequently</font>

374
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:52,240
someone got a very very good price on a

375
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:55,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">MacBook and poor mark yeah got a lot of</font>

376
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,519
suffering for it but I learned some

377
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,519
important moral lessons about not doing

378
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:02,440
bad things from that exercise which

379
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:07,419
which helped me a few months<font color="#E5E5E5"> later when</font>

380
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:09,279
tragedy struck in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cape Town I went off</font>

381
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,710
to Cape Town to go and see some friends

382
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,149
and as I left to board the<font color="#CCCCCC"> flight</font>

383
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,130
everything was<font color="#CCCCCC"> great they were just</font>

384
00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:17,830
chilling out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the garden by the time I</font>

385
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:19,750
arrived there had been some weird

386
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,269
passive aggressive stuff going on and

387
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:24,820
nearly a full scale fight requiring the

388
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:27,159
cops to turn up so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> my friends</font>

389
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nicky and Eddie of course it's not</font>

390
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:33,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">really Nicky and Eddie it's actually</font>

391
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:35,950
stock footage and and this is their

392
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:42,549
neighbors i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jeff and</font>

393
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:44,500
drop bags again not their real names so

394
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:46,029
Nikki and Eddie and their friends which

395
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,570
is chilling out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their garden in their</font>

396
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:51,130
apartment and they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just chatting</font>

397
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,510
away it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 8pm it's not</font>

398
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,070
particularly late they're not showing

399
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,690
particularly loud they were planning<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

400
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:58,418
having a bribe but they never actually

401
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,279
got around to it and then their

402
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:01,899
neighbors their<font color="#E5E5E5"> upstairs neighbors</font>

403
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:04,779
started saying something strange and

404
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:06,908
almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> strange kind of Weasley thing</font>

405
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:08,139
and rather than just saying hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

406
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:11,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're a bit loud could you turn it down</font>

407
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:15,990
well they came out with was well drop

408
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:22,330
bags apparently said Amy so do

409
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:25,240
it is the guy and he's the man in a kind

410
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:29,949
of rhythmic chant and then a few minutes

411
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:38,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">later they did it again he's a dude here</font>

412
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:40,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the high he's done man now I don't</font>

413
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:44,230
feel my life often resembles the League

414
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:45,580
of Gentlemen but in this case it did and

415
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,350
I arrived the next day and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

416
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,029
nearly been a full-blown fight why have

417
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,340
you sighs it's ready all right

418
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:55,240
realistically how can we mess with the

419
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:57,668
neighbors I learned an important life

420
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:02,770
lesson earlier in Berlin and I think we

421
00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:04,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> operate here and then I remembered</font>

422
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:06,070
I'd come back from a from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference</font>

423
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:08,380
in New Zealand a key week on where I'd

424
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,870
show nothing about how to go and deal

425
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:13,360
with people particularly hipsters from

426
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,070
coffee shops it's a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

427
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,418
massively effects Wellington and

428
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,908
Melbourne there's an absolute hipster

429
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:20,679
plague there but I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> why don't we</font>

430
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:22,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">just take the code that I did before and</font>

431
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,610
modify it rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing selective do</font>

432
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,080
your thing based on keyword we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

433
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">off everyone on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> neighbor's Wi-Fi</font>

434
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,639
network and I call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it thunder blade</font>

435
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,679
although the register called it a selfie

436
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">slayer and that's basically all there is</font>

437
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:37,990
to it and realistically to build one of

438
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:40,620
these you just need a Raspberry Pi such

439
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:44,470
as an a B or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 a 2 or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an equivalent a</font>

440
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:46,570
microSD card you did require a USB hub

441
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,860
for configuring because of the you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

442
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,770
you need a keyboard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and mouse from one</font>

443
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,959
of you until recently when with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0</font>

you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> just connect over</font>

00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:00,159
serial via USB and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use a tp-link</font>

447
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,059
they're bloody good and they do decent

448
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:05,408
injection and a USB power bank so i'll

449
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:08,260
just show you the code for this because

450
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:10,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">originally i wrote the code using scatty</font>

00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,980
excellent hands up anyone who's ever

453
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:19,178
used gappy for something at production

<font color="#E5E5E5">speed on low power</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doubt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way nope it</font>

455
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:24,070
doesn't work it's it's really really

456
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:25,750
great for analysis but because of the

457
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,189
layering and the splicing there's huge

458
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,549
amounts of objects flying around in

459
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,129
memory

460
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:31,809
and it involves huge amounts of context

461
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:34,230
switching to get stuff out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it so it</font>

462
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:36,908
slows<font color="#E5E5E5"> down so I found the DP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Katie</font>

463
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:39,279
python library which was massively quick

464
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:41,409
and just converts pretty much packets

465
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,879
into Python objects and that's it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

466
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:44,440
would suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're looking at</font>

467
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:46,330
doing something it's worth<font color="#CCCCCC"> checking out</font>

468
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,970
and having a look the one thing that

469
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:51,580
didn't work with this in DP<font color="#CCCCCC"> Katie was</font>

470
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:53,860
actually disassociating clients and that

471
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:57,699
wasn't because DP DP katie is no good

472
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:59,350
that's because my Python sucks so you

473
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,090
can see here for the original code I for

474
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:03,639
Kiwi con we have a series of target

475
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:08,039
keywords and that we're filtering on UDP

476
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:12,070
port 53 4 dns so we just rip that out

477
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:16,090
but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a thing about doing some</font>

478
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:17,710
sniffing seeing what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on we're</font>

479
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,869
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass any packets that come in</font>

480
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,669
see if they match our targets and kill

481
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:23,830
so we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> replace that past packet</font>

482
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:26,529
section and say if it's from is that our

483
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:29,889
bssid of interest is in there then kill

484
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:33,279
the packet and then because my DP<font color="#CCCCCC"> Katie</font>

485
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:34,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">deal code was terrible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I basically just</font>

486
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:38,950
shell out to where replay what could go

487
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:40,629
wrong right but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one small</font>

488
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,730
problem with this which Eddie pointed

489
00:22:40,629 --> 00:22:45,820
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm glad to have a moral guide</font>

490
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:51,789
in my friend Eddie south african jails

491
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:54,399
are not fun places to be so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I decided</font>

492
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:59,259
that maybe do your thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a step too</font>

493
00:22:54,399 --> 00:23:05,830
far but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't a step too far was a</font>

494
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:09,009
project<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like to call pupal now if</font>

495

anybody here speaks<font color="#E5E5E5"> Afrikaans they may</font>

496
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:12,940
know what that means but I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

497
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:19,168
talk about what goes into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a football</font>

498
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:23,169
first what you're going to need is an

499
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:24,970
esp8266 so this is a macbook keyboard at

500
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:27,929
the top that's a no Dempsey you on a

501
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:33,059
mini breadboard at the bottom there's a

502
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:35,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">is it it's a ESP 01 so this is a the</font>

503
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:41,090
node MCU on the breadboard it's pretty

504
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:44,140
small this is actually the ESP 01 they

505
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:47,530
about a pound these ones or the ESP 12

506
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:51,920
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> no Dempsey use about five quid and</font>

507
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:55,879
basically it's a programmable MCU with

508
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:57,350
an IP stack on Wi-Fi<font color="#CCCCCC"> built-in and you</font>

509
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,300
just leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those the Arduino IDE</font>

510
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:02,629
the extensions installed to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

511
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:06,169
program for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SPE to esp8266 and a big</font>

512
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:08,660
battery pack to power off so now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

513
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:11,810
what goes into a football what comes out

514
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,400
of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> purple now I know you're thinking</font>

515
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:17,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">and if you're thinking what I'm thinking</font>

516
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:19,190
you're one sick puppy but if you're not

517
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:23,600
thinking what I'm thinking then maybe

518
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:27,740
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are if the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer is crap over 80</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

519
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:30,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">11 because the esp8266 has a fantastic</font>

520
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,960
function in earlier versions of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDK</font>

521
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:35,449
that allow us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and send raw frames</font>

522
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,300
now I done about you but something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

523
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:43,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost one pound and let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be send raw 802</font>

524
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:46,159
11 frames has my interest and the pupal

525
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:48,949
POC is pretty simple we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

526
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,470
algorithm Utley generate<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSIDs saying</font>

527
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:54,350
that Jeff is one of the man the dude or

528
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:56,570
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy with an ID and we're going to</font>

529
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:58,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">broadcast them at a reasonable rate you</font>

530
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:00,320
can't broadcast them too quickly because

531
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:02,149
you'll take up the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel and</font>

532
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,429
then nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> else on that channel could</font>

533
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:06,170
transmit but that's not what this is

534
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,880
about I mean you could create something

535
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:12,140
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that very easily but that's not</font>

536
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:14,000
what I'm demonstrating here but

537
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:17,360
effectively the reason we have the extra

538
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,430
ID on the end is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you just have</font>

539
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jeff the man</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just the dude jeff the guy</font>

540
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:24,200
it doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you channel hop</font>

541
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:26,510
where we change bssid or SSID or

542
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,770
anything like that some of the operating

543
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,720
systems that you will encounter<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

544
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,970
have this appear once so you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

545
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,650
total<font color="#E5E5E5"> of three networks by putting an ID</font>

546
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:37,190
on the end that's randomly generated

547
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:40,640
each one of these can generate up to 256

548
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:42,620
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSIDs that will all show up in</font>

549
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,720
the list giving us a grand total of

550
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,510
seven hundred and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sixty-eight reasons</font>

551
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:52,850
why you should not call Eddie demand the

552
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:54,370
dude or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guy so i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you</font>

553
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,959
the code

554
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:58,750
which unlike the other stuff I've

555
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,710
actually got with me so let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me see I</font>

556
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:05,950
don't want to pop that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll</font>

557
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:11,230
spill everywhere you see if I can bring

558
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:13,180
this up mmm there we go I'll pop this

559
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:16,540
over here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just do your bit of a</font>

560
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:18,190
walk through what the codes about it's

561
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:21,399
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard actually most of this</font>

562
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:25,660
stuff came from elsewhere so you see if

563
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:28,950
I can even<font color="#E5E5E5"> begin their know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what</font>

564
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:32,020
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got over the top is we have a</font>

565
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:35,890
basic header that says we're looking at

566
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:39,370
the ESP stuff then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have random</font>

567
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:40,870
generator usual bits and pieces that's

568
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,399

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:50,260
put out that's the setup part for it and

571
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:53,320
then down below here we construct the

572
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:56,410
packet and then we construct the insult

573
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,389
and then we send it all out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we</font>

574
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:00,490
wait a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit and that's all it is is</font>

575
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:03,370
really really really very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

576
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:08,350
now assuming that this doesn't cause my

579
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:23,590
wait and we got that that area<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fire p</font>

583
00:27:44,210 --> 00:28:00,950
there you see what we can pick up area

584
00:27:52,090 --> 00:28:10,520
so Jeff's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dude</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the dude Jeff's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the guy if I go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over here it's a bit</font>

586
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,320
blaming it's a bit weak but the thing

587
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:17,510
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably wouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

588
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,330
you for risk of censure something like

00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:22,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">wassenaar or anything would be that all</font>

590
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:26,389
of the code here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just as easy to</font>

591
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:28,820
integrate into the esp8266 to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> deals</font>

592
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:31,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">attacks and if you were particularly</font>

593
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:33,310
malicious one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that you'd</font>

594
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:37,220
be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do would be to have one</font>

595
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:39,050
esp8266 listen and then another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one do</font>

596
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,990
the transmit so you have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that just</font>

597
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:46,930
scans for things that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected and</font>

598
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:49,220
then you send the deals the other way so

599
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,840
I've done this because I slowed it down

600
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,580
although the original device that I

601
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,980
built wasn't slow and it had the side

602
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:58,790
effect of causing minor problems with

603
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:01,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">network stability but I'd learned from</font>

604
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:04,610
Berlin always have a way to switch you

605
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:06,889
off so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this a wicked toy it's a</font>

606
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:11,629
bit of a lame thing oh shit I've ever

607
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:13,370
done plug that um but we have the Wi-Fi

Michael where if it receives too many

614
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,939
authentications it will shut down the

615
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:34,520
wireless part of the AP which was for

616
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,800
some reason a security feature but it

617
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:41,210
has the added side effect on some

force WPS so some lessons learned from

621
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:57,430
this device esp8266 is good and cheap

622
00:29:55,550 --> 00:30:00,850
but not exactly what we'd call it

623
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:03,950
it has a tendency to leak memory it's

624
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:05,419
not particularly well if you find

yourself coding functions to handle

627
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:12,399
resets fairly often it's a fiddly

628
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:16,010
platform because it runs at 3.3 volts

629
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,870
and has a limited input current so you

630
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,790
end up inevitably if you want to hook it

631

<font color="#E5E5E5">up to us be having to go and do</font>

632
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:24,830
something either with voltage dividers

633
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:28,790
or with a low dropout type a sort of

634
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:41,210
regulator and finally Eddie's neighbors

are assholes so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next toy i'm going</font>

and for various purposes some of which

647
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:21,620
are more legal than others so one of the

00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,100
loss due to attenuation basically from

having an aerial go into a cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into</font>

652

is not as good<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily as a normal</font>

boost circuitry or something that have

problems because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're very cheaply</font>

674
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:30,480
and basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it's made of is</font>

675
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything that will work with open wrt so</font>

676
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,380
if you have a home broadband router and

677
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:36,120
it's not far from your TV aerial for

678
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:39,120
example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do exactly the same</font>

679
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,159
thing with that using open wrt my

680
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:45,330
personal thing of choice at the moment

681
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:47,940
is the GLI nat64 16a or the AR 150 which

682
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:52,080
is a clone of a device called the

683
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:53,910
tp-link WR 703 m which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very very</font>

684
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,010
hackable device the GLI<font color="#CCCCCC"> nets more</font>

685
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:57,480
hackable it has lots of GPIO pins on it

686
00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:00,780
for you play around with but also

687
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:06,170
there's quite a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices this is the</font>

688
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:09,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">hutu trip made mini which is uses an MT</font>

689
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:11,610
5350 chipset and that basically lets you

690
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:15,300
go and do all the same stuff but it's

691
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:18,240
low power the wireless technology on the

692
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,830
board is not as<font color="#E5E5E5"> good as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the GLI nets but</font>

693
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:26,910
because we're not worried about that

694
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:28,620
we're worried about USB it's fine so we

695
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:30,750
install the open wrt firmware on our

696
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:32,129
device there are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways to do this one</font>

697
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,870
is to build the firmware so everything's

698
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:35,610
baked in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go and go into</font>

699
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:37,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> depth about that at bsides</font>

702
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:44,700
we'll go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into it in extreme detail about</font>

703
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:46,440
it step by step but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you install the open</font>

704
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,660
wrt firmware if you just want to build

705
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,450
this while you messing around run a

706
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:54,870
command called opkg update opkg install

707

tools over Wi-Fi to the device so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

711
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:13,199
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a demo which may or may not</font>

712
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:16,949
go as intended because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

713
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,549
this over 4g it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I am I don't</font>

714
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:25,449
trust the Wi-Fi here but

715
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:29,670
um yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't trust the Wi-Fi here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> All</font>

716
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:40,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">Right see how I can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this working oh</font>

717
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:40,170
no honey go my bag<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

718
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:48,030
I'm reaching in my pocket for cable I

719
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:48,029
promise

720
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:08,160
there we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

721
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,860
ok

722
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,330
ok

723
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,520
you just pull this off it

724
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,120
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

725
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:17,150
yeah di da da okay so there we go and I

726
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:17,150
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> pull this back over here</font>

727
00:36:21,819 --> 00:36:23,880
Oh

728
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,099
nope

729
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,070
there we go

730
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:49,510
so you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there we go so</font>

731
00:36:46,340 --> 00:37:00,280
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what the open wrt prompts like</font>

732
00:36:49,510 --> 00:37:00,280
let me just<font color="#CCCCCC"> do RT oh crap yeah</font>

733
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:18,480
okay rtl<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp minus a 0 0 0 s</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

734
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:20,340
what I've done is I've start the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTL</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp</font>

735
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,110
program and that will allow me to go and

736
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:27,810
connect to it<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously because i'm</font>

737
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:31,670
using 4g it's nowhere near as good in

738
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:35,120
terms of speed and in terms of latency

739
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:38,340
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and see if I can</font>

740
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:42,509
pick up some radio but i'll be picking

741
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:47,900
up radio from my home in<font color="#E5E5E5"> hampshire not</font>

742
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:47,900
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

743
00:37:50,710 --> 00:38:05,220
all right now i'll pop over to GQ RX and

744
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:05,220
if we pop this down to see 7.5

745
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:26,150
there should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be something popping up in</font>

746
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:30,589
a minute nope<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right my demo</font>

747
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:32,029
sucks so but basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you can do</font>

748
00:38:30,589 --> 00:38:34,130
is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was my home wireless network</font>

749
00:38:32,029 --> 00:38:35,509
it would all run perfectly smoothie and

750
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:38,660
the advantage of this is that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

751
00:38:35,509 --> 00:38:40,369
run your at<font color="#CCCCCC"> your radio tools and just</font>

752
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:42,219
use something like neck cap<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pipe the</font>

753
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:44,869
audio into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and pull it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out and</font>

754
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:46,279
meanwhile you've got your actual radio

755
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:50,469
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not got the attenuation loss</font>

756
00:38:46,279 --> 00:38:52,789
now you might wonder why this is useful

757
00:38:50,469 --> 00:39:01,029
but if you ever doing any large-scale

758
00:38:52,789 --> 00:39:05,170
signals analysis that would be why<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

759
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:05,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">just bring this over here a moment</font>

760
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:15,380
stay home

761
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">now obviously the reason that that</font>

762
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:25,509
didn't work was because it was for g and

763
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:28,240
the bandwidth that we've got isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

764
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:31,240
grade my upstream bandwidth is and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

765
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:39,669
so great either so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to go</font>

766
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:43,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the radio and there we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go we</font>

767
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:44,920
stopped and bring up a Firefox session

768
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:46,960
and I'll show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> something else that</font>

769
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:51,300
you can do now another package that is

770
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:55,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">standard in open wrt for some reason is</font>

771
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:59,050
i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> all dumped 10 90 which is an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ad</font>

772
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:02,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">SB receive a tool which all sounds very</font>

773
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:08,160
boring until you realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

774
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:08,160
actually do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting stuff on it</font>

775
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,740
start-

776
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:26,209
ah

777
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,210
because I believe you

778
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,340
ok

779
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:13,600
all right sorry are at some stray<font color="#CCCCCC"> ltl</font>

780
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:13,600
processes running<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

781
00:41:28,549 --> 00:41:36,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so it should come up there there we</font>

782
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:36,609
go alright so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just bring this over</font>

783
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:43,299
okay

784
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,970
there we go

785
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:55,269
right so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we zoom in on here we can</font>

786
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:57,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually track aircraft flying over</font>

787
00:41:55,269 --> 00:42:00,490
quite a distance all the way up from

788
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:03,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">milton keynes pretty much all the way</font>

789
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:05,799
down the south coast and around Heathrow

790
00:42:03,009 --> 00:42:07,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">and although this doesn't look very</font>

791
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:10,210
clear what this is is you have the

792
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:11,740
actual flight reference a squawk code

793
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:13,299
which tells you better about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what sort</font>

794
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:17,140
of light it is and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it's doing the</font>

795
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:18,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">altitude the speed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attract and then what</font>

796
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,900
happens is with this tool it's got very

797
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,480
nice little web interface if you click

798
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:29,680
on a fly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then go and look the</font>

799
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:32,759
flight<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on a tool like flightaware or</font>

800
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:35,410
in this case possibly not that flight

801
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:38,650
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> try this one there we go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easyjet</font>

802
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,970
that'll do for some flights fight or

803
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:42,940
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're at the info for because it's</font>

804
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:47,189
private but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see here that this</font>

805
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:47,190
is an easy jet flight<font color="#E5E5E5"> going from</font>

806
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:54,369
somewhere to somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't really</font>

807
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:55,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">see the screen very well but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um the</font>

808
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:57,430
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to do this at bsides</font>

809
00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:01,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Athens is because they get some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

810
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:06,399
interesting flights coming in it turns

811
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:08,319
out that European<font color="#E5E5E5"> Urich rats um all use</font>

812
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,049
various different types of chart jets

813
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:12,369
for official troika business and it's

814
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:14,200
the sort of thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could run in</font>

815
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:15,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">Greece to go and track those flights and</font>

816
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,740
then you could see where else those

817
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:19,079
flights have gone because<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

818
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:21,578
flights have to log their flight history

819
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:23,650
so you could see for example but perhaps

820
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:26,200
when a distinguished member of the

821
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:29,579
troika is visiting to go and ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> receive</font>

822
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:32,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">it would have mind bending over that</font>

823
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:35,289
that person or at least that plane had

824
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:37,960
come from Germany but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it also flown to</font>

825
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:40,299
Portugal so it flown from Portugal to

826
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,440
Germany to Greece and that if you check

827
00:43:40,299 --> 00:43:43,509
the news you'll see that there was a

828
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,490
negotiation in Portugal a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> days</font>

829
00:43:43,509 --> 00:43:47,890
earlier so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite interested in</font>

830
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:50,200
correlating some of that information and

831
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:54,089
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a look and seeing how are</font>

832
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,089
great European democracy works

833
00:43:54,180 --> 00:44:00,120
so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> um that's that now that's kind</font>

834
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:04,560
of the boundary<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what I would legally</font>

835
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:09,839
be able to show you not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to call which</font>

836
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:16,770
side<font color="#E5E5E5"> entirely let me take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font>

837
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:21,660
and then here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go why is this a wicked</font>

838
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:24,870
toy well first of all you could go and

839
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:27,120
fit something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a d/s 1307 RTC module</font>

840
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:31,589
via gpio especially if you add something

841
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:34,319
like a 64 16 a does<font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody know what</font>

842
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:40,800
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you give a software-defined</font>

843
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:43,590
radio a<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time clock</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you're able</font>

844
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">to start sniffing frequencies within the</font>

845
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:48,690
range that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are very time sensitive and</font>

846
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,670
you can then start looking at time slots

847
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:52,440
and start analyzing when those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

848
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:54,450

849
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,890
which is the sort of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

850
00:44:54,450 --> 00:45:00,029
would need if you were going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do any</font>

851
00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:01,710
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on GSM and because gsm broadcasts</font>

852
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,780
very loudly you would be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put one</font>

853
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:06,170
of those devices in<font color="#E5E5E5"> say a friend's flat</font>

in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Berlin</font>

855
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:13,220
and have it listen to and stream data

856
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:18,020
back of course I chose instead to use an

857
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:20,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">Arduino and basically make somebody's</font>

862
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:35,210

analyze the stuff on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box itself and</font>

880
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:25,130
send useful data up then you could

881
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,109
hypothetically have something like a

882
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:29,390
multi lon ng node that sits in a

883
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:32,030
friend's house and looks at pox<font color="#E5E5E5"> egg</font>

884
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:34,759

885
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:37,730
tool to a web service on the dark web

886
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:41,930
I'm not aware of such a service existing

887
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:43,700
so it's a hypothetical thing you could

888
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:46,460
also use a micro SD<font color="#CCCCCC"> card for data</font>

889

logging if for example one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

915
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:59,910
we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing badges that have had</font>

916
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,680
circuits on them and there are two

917
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:03,509
complaints that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we commonly get the</font>

918
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,779
first one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we commonly get is these</font>

919
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:08,730
badges don't work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a refund</font>

920
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:10,080
the second complaint we often have is

921
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:12,390
that these badges are quite hard to

922
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,720
assemble sometimes requiring custom

923
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:17,190
cable adapters sometimes requiring

924
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,660
circuits impact by sorry of chips and

925
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:20,850
packages that are really hard to

926
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:22,950
actually put together so we started

927
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:24,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at this and we started bouncing</font>

928
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:25,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">some ideas around and we're hoping to</font>

929
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">have it ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for this year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if not we'll</font>

930
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:29,700
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else that is equally easy</font>

931
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:31,350
to put together but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk to</font>

932
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,720
you about what i call the minimalist

00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:37,529
electronic learner and that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

934
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:39,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">seven bits of equipment but it's seven</font>

935
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:41,160
things that when put together you can do

936
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:42,870
all manner of stuff and the design of

937
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:46,319
this thing is designed specifically to

938
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:48,330
enable you the user to modify the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT</font>

939
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,670
hardware that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it do the</font>

940
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:54,299
things that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so let's</font>

941
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:56,820
say for example that you had a smart fan

942
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,230
but the smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> fan requires you to use an</font>

943
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:00,660
app and sign up to a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> load of T's</font>

944
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:02,730
and C's<font color="#CCCCCC"> and costs 100</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pounds but instead</font>

945
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:05,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">you went to a shop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you bought a dumb</font>

946
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:07,350
fan for 20 quid and all you really want

947
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:09,390
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is to come on when it's warm while</font>

948
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:11,580
using one of these devices and relay you

949
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:13,650
could prototype of a circuit very easily

950
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:15,810
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and switch the fan on with a TMP</font>

951
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:17,640
36 sensor or any number of other

952
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:19,200
temperature sensors to say when the

953
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:22,410
temperature goes above this level switch

954
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,120
the fan on another example of a thing

955
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:27,690
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've actually done is build a</font>

956
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:29,759
Raspberry Pi off switch which is using

957
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:32,210
one of these to go and connect to a

958
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:35,760
raspberry pi over the GPIO port

959
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:38,250
connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> over serial issue login issue</font>

961
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:41,760
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the serial connection goes down</font>

962
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:44,820
flash a light so you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe to</font>

963
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:47,550
unplug so the principle<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind this is</font>

964
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:49,320
modifying stuff and also enabling cool

00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:51,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">research in Hardware buses and things</font>

966
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:53,100
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so although it doesn't look</font>

967
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:55,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">like much on a breadboard will have a</font>

968
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,759
PCB hopefully by 44<font color="#CCCCCC"> Khan if not then</font>

969
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:59,940
we're going to do a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> circuit</font>

970
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,770
that we've already got but it supports a

971
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:03,990
thing called universal serial interface

972
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:06,540
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing it basically means that</font>

973
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:09,000
anything that you can send down it you

974
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:11,779
can write library for and then go it

975
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,770
will emulate any type of bus or signal

976
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:16,020
interaction communication type thing you

977
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:18,600
want and because of that it supports USB

978
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:21,090
now we can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> these devices to do USB</font>

979
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,980
head attacks we can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> these devices to</font>

980
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:25,050
impersonate mice various other things we

981
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:29,130
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> even impersonate USB 1.1 mass</font>

982
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:30,960
storage can also use<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITC and spi either</font>

983
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:32,460
a slaves or masters and start messing

984
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,320
around with chips so if you wanted to go

985
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:36,630
and build<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device to pull the flash</font>

986
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,160
of a specific chip then this would be a

987
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:42,000
really really interesting thing to use

988
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:45,569
