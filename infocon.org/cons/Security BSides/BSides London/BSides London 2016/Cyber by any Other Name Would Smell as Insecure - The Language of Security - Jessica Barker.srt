6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,180
talking to you about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> language of</font>

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:21,029
security somebody said to me last night

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,400
they saw my title like what on earth is

9
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:26,910
she talking about cyber by any other

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,070
name would smell as insecure so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,050
get into my talk which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all about the</font>

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,630
language<font color="#E5E5E5"> of security how we talk about</font>

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,450
security and particularly the notion of

14
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">cyber security i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to introduce</font>

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,840
myself for those of you who don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:46,079
who I am so I am dr.<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jessica Parker i am</font>

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,539
not this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doctor but this kind of</font>

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,149
doctor which means i can't help when

19
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,809
this happens because my work is much

20
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:58,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">more serious i work in information</font>

21
00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:00,989
security i am<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of these or one of</font>

22
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:05,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">these and i don't often go to work</font>

23
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:08,220
dressed like this casual<font color="#E5E5E5"> friday only i</font>

24
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:10,590
am a consultant<font color="#E5E5E5"> i work for myself as a</font>

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,840
consultant so if you ask google image

26
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,409
search what consultant does you will

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,229
find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i create success and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

28
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:24,240
solve puzzles so everybody gives me high

29
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:26,640
fives and fist bumps as per as well as

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,470
my day job as a consultant I also get to

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,170
do fun stuff like this so I speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

32
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,860
events like<font color="#CCCCCC"> b-sides and steal corn EMF</font>

33
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:37,079
camp and I do a fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of media work</font>

34
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:40,259
usually talking about the latest cyber

35
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:45,449
attack or cyber breach so you will see

36
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:50,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">me in the media looking shocked looking</font>

37
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:55,920
angry looking disappointed and as of

38
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:57,329
last week looking very sad so working an

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,610
information security I don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

40
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:02,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all and it can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make you angry</font>

41
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:06,689
it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make you disappointed it can make</font>

42
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:09,090
you angry and disappointed and sad<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

43
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,160
try to relieve those brushes by doing

44
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,940
stuff like this

45
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,430
and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this stuff like this and</font>

46
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:20,750
i<font color="#CCCCCC"> also like making things like this</font>

47
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:24,560
which is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> alarm clock not a bomb this</font>

48
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:27,170
switch is a kitchen<font color="#E5E5E5"> timer and a little</font>

49
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,080
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of jewelry making as well I've also</font>

50
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,359
done something right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I don't</font>

51
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">think anyone else in this room has done</font>

52
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:39,080
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I have stolen from the man who</font>

53
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,820
robbed<font color="#E5E5E5"> bank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> robs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> banks himself if you</font>

54
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,030
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about go to</font>

55
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:45,560
EMF camp and see freaky clown talk about

56
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:50,560
robbing banks and you'll realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

57
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:53,090
just shamelessly ripped off his intro so

58
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,520
cyber by any other name would smell as

59
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,680
insecure I'm talking today about the

60
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">language of security my background is in</font>

61
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,870
sociology a little bit of psychology

62
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:08,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">civic design so very much from the human</font>

63
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:10,490
side of things and I apply knowledge of

64
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,290
society knowledge about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> people think</font>

65
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:15,020
and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> people act to my work in</font>

66
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:17,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">cybersecurity as a day job I'm usually</font>

67
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:20,120
working with companies and to help them

68
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,630
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity with awareness</font>

69
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,580
raising stuff communications programs

70
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:27,290
cultural change and looking at policies

71
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,660
and procedures and how you drive those

72
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,940
through an organization I also do bits

73
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:35,240
of research as you'll find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> later on</font>

74
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:37,490
in the presentation so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

75
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:42,500
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> really quickly by looking at some</font>

76
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:45,230
definitions we use lots of terms in this

77
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:48,020
community in this industry and also

78
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:51,890
outside of the industry and when we're

79
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:53,570
talking about what we do so information

80
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:56,269
security I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is what most</font>

81
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:58,130
people would<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably say they do over</font>

82
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,260
cybersecurity most people prefer the

83
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:02,440
term information security and if we look

84
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">at least I have a definition there and</font>

85
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,650
protection<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information and</font>

86
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,600
information systems from an authorized

87
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,459
access use disclosure and it's

88
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,070
particularly around CIA confidentiality

89
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:16,269
integrity and availability of

90
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:18,738
information it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the dictionary</font>

91
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:21,570
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> security so it's not in</font>

92
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:23,729
popular lexicon

93
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,550
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not information security is it</font>

94
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:30,810
data security this is the protection<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

95
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:33,630
data from unauthorized modification

96
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,550
destruction etc so for that you have to

97
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:39,090
ask well what is data what is data and

98
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:41,310
not information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and data is electronic</font>

99
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,099
this is according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NIST so data</font>

100
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,230
security is a subset of information

101
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,320
security if we look at like that also

102
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:52,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">not in the dictionary so not in popular</font>

103
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,040
use information assurance is often you'd

104
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:58,619
used and information assurance is about

105
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,580
protecting and defending information and

106
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,740
systems by ensuring CIA na so we've got

107
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,270
CIA and then we've got non-repudiation

108
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:11,850
and authentication so a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit wider</font>

109
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:13,799
also not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dictionary sometimes</font>

110
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">people use information assurance i have</font>

111
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,360
found interchangeably interchangeably

112
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,460
with information security or they'll use

113
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,880
it kind of to talk about audit<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and</font>

114
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">iso 27001 and use it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a slightly more</font>

115
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,920
technical way so there we have

116
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,440
information assurance finally we come to

117
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:34,200
the dreaded one<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber security the one</font>

118
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,870
that most people roll their eyes at

119
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,270
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security</font>

120
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,610
according to nest protecting or

121
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,469
defending cyberspace from cyber attacks

122
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,030
so we need two<font color="#CCCCCC"> more definitions to</font>

123
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,480
understand that one what a cyberspace

124
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:51,049
that is the global domain of information

125
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,940
independent interdependent networks

126
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:58,290
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet it</font>

127
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:02,460
is telecoms it is computer systems cyber

128
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:04,410
attack is an attack in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> space and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

129
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,950
it's particularly looking at disrupting

130
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:10,560
disabling destroying cyberspace cyber

131
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,659
security is the one term in the

132
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,730
dictionary so cyber security is in the

133
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,710
dictionary the dictionary has a much

134
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,900
more straightforward definition for

135
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:22,260
cyber<font color="#CCCCCC"> security measures taken to protect</font>

136
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:25,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">a computer or computer system as on the</font>

137
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet against unauthorized access or</font>

138
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:31,320
attack so there we have it cyber

139
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:33,650
security has got into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dictionary so</font>

140
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,180
what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean how come that</font>

141
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:39,169
tim has<font color="#E5E5E5"> got in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the dictionary when none</font>

142
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:42,530
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the others have and the very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

143
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:46,639
answer is usage popular usage people use

144
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:49,429
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so merriam-webster people who make</font>

145
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,680
the dictionary they track width that are

they when they gets to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

level of usage in society that term will

149
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,100
go in the dictionary so they have deemed

150
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:04,789
cybersecurity as being deserving of

going into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dictionary when we talk</font>

if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look back through history we find</font>

158
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,789
that cyber has evolved actually from

159
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:31,599
ancient Greek times and it's been used

160
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:36,710
throughout time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mean kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of steering</font>

161
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:40,750
directing governing and it was taken

162
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:43,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">really forward in the 1940s and as</font>

163
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:46,190
cybernetics and this was meaning control

164
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:48,500
and communication theory and that was

met<font color="#E5E5E5"> Weather Machine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or animal so not</font>

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">just restricted to what we would</font>

167
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:55,159
traditionally think of as a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

168
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:59,030
cyberspace but relating to humans as

00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:02,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">well as machines cyberspace came along</font>

170
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:05,510
in the 1980s<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as science fiction fans</font>

william gibson and in his short story

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,240
burning chrome and it then became much

more<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> neuromancer and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll get</font>

175
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,659
on later to why gibson chose cyberspace

176
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:23,360
and why he chose that particular ticular

177
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:25,460
amped him and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> went through a series</font>

178
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,070
of thoughts and he dismissed and

179
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:31,250
considered other teams but settled on

180
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:33,559
cyberspace so cyber has been around for

181
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:37,279
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> while and it's been meaning directed</font>

182
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:40,338
governing controlling commanding and

183
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,088
used to kind of mean this relationship

184
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:45,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">between machine</font>

185
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:49,129
an animal but when it's used in this

186
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:53,319
industry it often elicits this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

187
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:56,509
response so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't generally</font>

188
00:08:53,319 --> 00:09:01,969
within this industry want to take cyber

189
00:08:56,509 --> 00:09:05,269
or cyber security that seriously to the

190
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">point where it can make people irritated</font>

191
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:09,680
and angry and it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make you know</font>

192
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,629
Cybermen a whole different thing 20

193
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,779
years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how people are using it in</font>

194
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:19,730
a business sense or in an IT sense and

195
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:24,259
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say in general is</font>

196
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:26,089
not particularly happy with that so I as

197
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:28,279
i said earlier i do research and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do</font>

198
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:31,939
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for companies but I also do that</font>

199
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:34,220
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my own interest and so earlier</font>

200
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:35,509
this week I was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this talk</font>

201
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,249
I was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about cybersecurity</font>

202
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:40,730
information security I was thinking

203
00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:42,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">about definitions so I asked the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

204
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,740
people of Twitter knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that most of</font>

205
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,050
my followers or most of people i follow

206
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:50,149
work in this industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I asked which of</font>

207
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:52,008
the following terms do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use to mean</font>

208
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:54,709
protecting against hacking another data

209
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:57,319
loss now I struggled a bit with how to

210
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:59,300
phrase the question I wanted it to be

211
00:09:57,319 --> 00:10:00,860
kind of generic and kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level</font>

212
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,128
<font color="#CCCCCC">and something that someone outside of</font>

213
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,300
the industry would relate to as well so

214
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:08,110
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of holes you could pick</font>

215
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,069
in how I chose to ask that question and

216
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,410
but I think you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the general</font>

217
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:17,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">point I was making it got quite a good</font>

218
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:20,870
response and so 400 votes and the vast

219
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:25,490
majority of people relate to information

220
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:28,160
security and last is data security so

221
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">people were not keen on that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber</font>

222
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">security was kind of middling but still</font>

223
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,929
that was less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> half of cyber of</font>

224
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:37,670
information security so people<font color="#CCCCCC"> relate to</font>

225
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:40,850
information security much more they use

226
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:43,910
it much more and I thought it was

227
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting to consider that in light of</font>

228
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:49,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">the definitions I went through at the</font>

229
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:51,920
start so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we look at the question I've</font>

230
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:54,270
asked and I didn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be quite as</font>

231
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,110
precise as I was but I said hacking

232
00:10:54,270 --> 00:11:01,350
other data loss so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am probably</font>

233
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:03,240
alluding to kind of cyberspace if we

234
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:07,320
think about these typical definitions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

235
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,470
am talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about electronic information</font>

236
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,370
i'm talking about the internet

237
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,070
telecommunication network computer

238
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:16,140
systems and as i said earlier

239
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:19,620
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> security probably sits above</font>

240
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:22,110
that so if we're being technical<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font>

241
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,850
argue that cyber security if we got off

242
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nist definitions is actually much</font>

243
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,990
more applicable to the question that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

244
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,780
asked but anyway we'll move on<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that</font>

245
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">I asked Twitter because I particularly</font>

246
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,860
wanted a response from the community I

247
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:39,180
particularly wanted people who work in

248
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:41,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">the industry and I also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to hear</font>

249
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,560
what they had to say about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I got</font>

250
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,000
loads of conversation and discussion I

251
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,310
could have picked loads of tweets to

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,800
focus on and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just wanted to put some</font>

253
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:52,469
up here and to try and reflect what

254
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,719
people were saying I really agree with

255
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,120
Chris's point at the top and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris</font>

256
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,650
Ratcliffe isn't here today and but he

257
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,360
came back very quickly to say they all

258
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:05,699
mean the same thing and different things

259
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:10,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's confusing Carl who may be</font>

260
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:13,920
here today<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey hello Carl said and this</font>

261
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,690
one I also can relate to I use cyber

262
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,800
when providing headline marketing

263
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:21,330
information and information IT security

264
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,430
at all other times so when he's talking

265
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:26,910
internally I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm with colleagues</font>

266
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:28,650
and using IT security and talking

267
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:33,480
externally trying to engage with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

268
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:35,790
media using cybersecurity a very common

269
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,620
kind of response was the one as soon as

270
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone uses the term cyber I instantly</font>

271
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,850
to stop taking anything that pays and

272
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,530
says seriously and lots of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

273
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,580
said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing to me today when</font>

274
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,800
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been asking what you're talking</font>

275
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,320
about and I might mean the terms like

276
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,729
security

277
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,560
and they will kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of roll their eyes</font>

278
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:55,130
and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get like this kind of</font>

279
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:59,300
stuff and cyber is like the dreaded word

280
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:01,130
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michelle's point was really</font>

281
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,689
valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because i was saying</font>

282
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,520
cybersecurity probably resonates more

283
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,410
outside of the industry it resonates

284
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,140
more with the public it resonates more

285
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:11,959
certainly with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the media and who concern</font>

286
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:15,080
was if that's the case than other sort

287
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">of less flashy less technical data loss</font>

288
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,270
and information<font color="#E5E5E5"> last hello Michelle and</font>

289
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,700
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be overlooked and not taken as</font>

291
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,180
good point but i think i<font color="#CCCCCC"> would argue</font>

292
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:29,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in the industry we delineate</font>

293
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,489
between computer information and say

294
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,340
paper<font color="#CCCCCC"> information but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think sort of</font>

295
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,780
two people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the media or at home if a</font>

00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,640
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of records are lost whether</font>

297
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:41,089
they're on paper or whether they're

298
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:45,350
online it's the impact that they're

299
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:47,060
interested in um and I tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

300
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">some people who said you know that they</font>

301
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,170
didn't like cyber security and this

302
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,660
response here i'm so happy cyber

303
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:56,150
security is not in the lead and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i tried</font>

304
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know why is that what is it</font>

305
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:01,100
that you particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> dislike about it</font>

306
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,990
and the main response<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got back was</font>

307
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,580
that it seems like a hike marketing team

308
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:08,870
it seems like something that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

309
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:10,640
buzzword and<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of sort</font>

311
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:16,069
it's a big like screaming headline cyber

312
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:18,680
cyber cyber and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what the</font>

313
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:21,020
community thinks according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my poll on</font>

00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:26,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">Twitter and some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting and</font>

315
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:30,500
important points were raised and I then

316
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:33,170
asked sort of general public so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did a</font>

317
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:36,200
poll I was looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a thousand</font>

318
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:38,930
responses<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got 737 so I got a pretty</font>

319
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">good response I asked exactly the same</font>

320
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:43,189
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually asked this one first</font>

321
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,230
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why the terming was probably a</font>

322
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,450
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit clunky but I wanted to ask</font>

323
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:50,360
the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could relate to</font>

324
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:52,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody outside of the industry and what</font>

325
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,230
I found probably won't surprise anyone

326
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,920
the term cyber security resonates the

327
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:59,600
most and with the general public what

328
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,110
did surprise me with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> findings after</font>

329
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,930
that

330
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:05,390
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> information security which is our top</font>

331
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:07,459
response was last on the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

332
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:11,510
general public it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually just</font>

333
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:13,640
slightly below e<font color="#E5E5E5"> security he security</font>

334
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,500
like I really questioned even putting

335
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,380
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just thought what</font>

336
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,089
is that but in looking around at terms

337
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,769
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and reading up for</font>

338
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:23,750
doing this talk I saw a couple of

339
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:25,730
references to e security softer I'll put

340
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,680
that warning<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a bit of a joke and then</font>

341
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,050
that's more popular than<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

342
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,189
security so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a weird I didn't put</font>

343
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in the Twitter one because you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

344
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:36,980
only give four responses and I didn't

345
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">think anyone was going to come back with</font>

346
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but I think if I'd asked the people</font>

347
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">of Twitter that they probably wouldn't</font>

348
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:47,660
have picked a security and I know you

349
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:50,180
get ecommerce you know an email but that

350
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:54,740
to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> seems like a more outdated term</font>

351
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:56,449
than cybersecurity second most popular

352
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,120
as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see not far behind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber</font>

353
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">security is data security I don't know</font>

354
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,899
if that's because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> put data in the</font>

355
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:04,010
question if I'd put information in the

356
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:05,209
question maybe I would have got a

357
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,069
different response and this is the

358
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:08,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem with doing research is that it</font>

359
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,730
always opens up a whole host of other

360
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,740
questions but what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> hoping you will</font>

361
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:15,260
take him from these last few slides is

362
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:18,709
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> general public relate to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber</font>

363
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:21,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">security it's made through kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

364
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:22,790
barrier they relate to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it they think of</font>

365
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,880
it when they think of data loss they

366
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,260
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when they think of hacking</font>

367
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,449
far more than they think of information

368
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,420
security information security is the

369
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:35,959
least popular term the one that they

370
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">relate to and resonate with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the least so</font>

371
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:38,750
at the minute we've got a big gap

372
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:43,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">between what we are saying and what we</font>

373
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:46,250
relate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what they hear why does</font>

374
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:48,740
this matter well language has been

375
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:51,769
around for a very long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> 150,000</font>

376
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,720
years potentially it's mainly used as

377
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:55,880
speech and it evolves as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk and we</font>

378
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,800
know it evolves we know that language

379
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,990
changes a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we know that sometimes</font>

380
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,880
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and sometimes</font>

381
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,980
this can threaten people this is why you

382
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,679
get people<font color="#E5E5E5"> occasionally up in arms about</font>

383
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,559
text speak and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know everyone using</font>

384
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">low</font>

385
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,480
and OMG and stuff like that people worry

386
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,939
that language is being destroyed and

387
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,309
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we had a set language and</font>

388
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:20,799
now we're losing it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> really language</font>

389
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:23,470
naturally evolves and all sorts of

390
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:27,220
weirds change so yes I / meant something

391
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:29,139
different 20 years ago but the word slut

392
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,019
used to mean someone who was messy and

393
00:17:29,139 --> 00:17:35,229
untidy and didn't do housework so that

394
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:36,730
words changed a little bit wicked wicked

395
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:40,869
used to mean someone who was actually

396
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:44,769
evil and saying with sick you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

397
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:47,740
words change a lot and<font color="#CCCCCC"> evolve and when</font>

398
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:49,809
we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is always ambiguous</font>

399
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,820
you can say something<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it can easily</font>

400
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:53,619
be misinterpreted so when you're trying

401
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> communicate something what you're</font>

402
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:58,119
actually always<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is you're relying</font>

403
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:59,769
on mutual knowledge and understanding if

404
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:02,619
you're not doing that then you're just

405
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:05,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking and people aren't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

406
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:08,590
listening so if you are what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called a</font>

407
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,029
cooperative speaker then you need to

408
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,970
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how your crafting what</font>

409
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:15,759
you're saying in a way the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bears in mind</font>

410
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,529
the listener what they've experienced so

411
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,179
far what their assumptions are what

412
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:21,700
their knowledge is what their interests

413
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:23,440
are how you can phrase what you're

414
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,519
saying so that it will actually get

415
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,379
through to them and I think I read some

416
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:32,529
stuff that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of said when you're</font>

417
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:35,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">speaking you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> automatically thinking</font>

418
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:37,330
how can I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> my message huge how can I</font>

419
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:40,720
say something to make sure that people

420
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually engage with it and I think you</font>

421
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,499
usually are thinking that you're either

422
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:46,119
thinking that all your thinking how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

423
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,889
i impress the person that's listening to

424
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:49,990
me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a choice of either</font>

425
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:52,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">making yourself heared I'm probably</font>

426
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:54,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">still potentially impressing them but</font>

427
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,799
how can I make myself heard or how can I

428
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,840
sound impressive and knowledgeable how

429
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,820
can I either bring them in or shut them

430
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,070
out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what language does they</font>

431
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:05,428
either engages with people or it puts

432
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,428
them off

433
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:14,980
and what we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remember when we are</font>

434
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:16,660
communicating is we are talking on kind

435
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,370
of three levels when we are in an

436
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,230
industry and we're trying to communicate

437
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,209
a message or trying to change behaviors

438
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,610
or we're trying to drive some change

439
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,170
we're doing that with individuals so

440
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,659
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of one-on-one with</font>

441
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,730
people we're also trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it with</font>

442
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">organizations we're trying to shape the</font>

443
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,390
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations act we're trying to</font>

444
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,530
make organizations more<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure we're</font>

445
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to make them understand our</font>

446
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:40,420
agenda maybe give us<font color="#E5E5E5"> more budget and</font>

447
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,910
give us more resources take what we're

448
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,830
saying actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> seriously and we are</font>

449
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:47,290
also trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change on a higher level</font>

450
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,600
than that so we are thinking about the

451
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:52,330
law and making the law understand what

452
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,889
we do why it's important and how they

453
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:56,649
need to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> and respect what we</font>

454
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:59,350
do to shape laws that are appropriate so

455
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,570
we are communicating on three levels the

456
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:04,540
micro level<font color="#CCCCCC"> with individuals the miso</font>

457
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:09,850
level with organizations and the macro

458
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:11,590
level with governments and societies and

459
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,120
what we're in danger of doing if we

460
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:15,070
don't shape our language in a way that

461
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,719
people understand and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't shape</font>

462
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,540
our language in a way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience</font>

463
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,580
can engage with then we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

464
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:24,340
affect<font color="#CCCCCC"> change in the way that we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

465
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:30,220
we'll just build silos and it will

466
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:32,889
tumble like the Tower of Babel<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if we</font>

467
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:34,990
don't have a frame of<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

468
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,130
fitting and understood because you may

469
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,630
think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't matter whether it's</font>

470
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,960
information security whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's cyber</font>

471
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:42,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">security and I can talk my language I</font>

472
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't need to be heard but there are</font>

473
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:47,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">many examples where we've seen people</font>

474
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,950
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're being understood</font>

475
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:54,570
people operating in a certain way and

476
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:57,910
that having extreme consequences when

477
00:20:54,570 --> 00:21:04,210
they aren't actually fully understood so

478
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:07,450
for example NASA built a my example is

479
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:09,940
completely gone out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my head so I'm</font>

480
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to move on but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a frame</font>

481
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,200
of reference distraction where are you

482
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,880
Collin I'm going to use distraction from

483
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,010
your talk earlier and a frame of

484
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">reference is really important when we're</font>

485
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,950
talking to people because what we're

486
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:24,059
trying to do is

487
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:25,320
shape their choices so we are trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

488
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:27,840
communicate with individuals

489
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,730
organizations and societies in a way to

490
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,309
lead them down the right path and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

491
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,500
that by<font color="#E5E5E5"> framing our communications and</font>

492
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:36,928
our language in a certain way whenever

493
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,610
we talk to people we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking with an</font>

494
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:40,860
agenda and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can either take those</font>

495
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:44,908
people with us or we can close them off

496
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:47,459
and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course when we're trying to</font>

497
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:51,210
effect change we inevitably have to

498
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,559
relate with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> media so the media as we</font>

499
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,870
all know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last couple of years</font>

500
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,510
have really engaged with<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity</font>

501
00:21:54,870 --> 00:22:00,239
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interested in cyber and</font>

502
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:02,610
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's interesting they think</font>

503
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,440
it's a headline grabber and this is why

504
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,750
cybersecurity stories have risen

505
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:11,220
research suggests x over four hundred

506
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:14,010
percent in the last couple of years<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

507
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,529
we saw I or I personally saw after talk

508
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:18,629
talk last<font color="#CCCCCC"> year the effect of the media</font>

509
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:21,059
so the media really<font color="#E5E5E5"> latched on to talk</font>

510
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:24,269
talk not because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was such an amazing</font>

511
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:26,639
attack or because the attack itself was

512
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:29,730
a game-changer but because they had a

513
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:32,428
story in the CEO and how the

514
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:34,380
communications were carried out and

515
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:36,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">after that for me personally I found a</font>

516
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,760
massive increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> in incident response</font>

517
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:41,340
people interested in how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to craft their</font>

518
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:44,100
incident response plans in doing

Incident Response tabletop exercises you

520
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:50,370
know in not being the next talk talk so

521
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:52,500
the media has a huge influence it has an

522
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,779
influence with organizations and it has

523
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,120
an influence with individuals and the

524
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:59,010
media really<font color="#CCCCCC"> love cyber you are not</font>

525
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,969
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see somebody said earlier to me</font>

526
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,850
you know you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see on the</font>

527
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,929
front page<font color="#E5E5E5"> and reverse shell you're not</font>

528
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,580
going to see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

529
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:08,130
cyber attack you're not going to see

00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:10,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">information security breach you're going</font>

531
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:12,630
to see cyber breach because it just

532
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:14,909
resonates with people as my research

533
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:19,320
suggested earlier much more than

534
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:23,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">information security why is it that it</font>

535
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,480
resonates more with people and one

536
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,110
reason I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think could be down to the</font>

537
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,779
fluency heuristic so heuristics are

538
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:32,120
rules of thumb heuristics are ways of

539
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:33,620
your brain

540
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,320
making decisions and going through

541
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:39,469
choices<font color="#CCCCCC"> and without really thinking</font>

542
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,179
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so you automatically do</font>

543
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,250
something make a decision think a

544
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,280
certain way because your brain just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

545
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:48,860
of operates on autopilot so there's all

546
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,780
sorts of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> heuristics and quite</font>

547
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:54,590
interesting when it comes to cyber

548
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,820
security and and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ones that I</font>

549
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,770
find particularly interesting when it

550
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,929
comes to communication is around fluency

551
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:02,570
and the fluency heuristic is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

552
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,520
it's basically the easier more

553
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,129
straightforward more concise that you

554
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:10,010
can explain a message the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely</font>

555
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:12,080
you are to<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect change so if you can</font>

556
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:14,000
explain something in a simple but

557
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,580
elegant way then<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will have far more</font>

558
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">impacts than if you use technical jargon</font>

559
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,379
your technical way of explaining it

560
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:24,800
might be more precise but it won't have

561
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,990
an impact and for me this really

562
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,180
resonates for example with two factor

563
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,760
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-factor authentication</font>

564
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:34,430
is quite simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it is pretty</font>

565
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,430
effective but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did some research last</font>

566
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:39,650
year that suggests that only eighty

567
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:41,960
percent so sorry only<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty percent of</font>

568
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,550
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so seventy percent of</font>

569
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">people said that they didn't understand</font>

two-factor authentication eighty<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent</font>

571
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:51,800
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people said they don't use it so it's</font>

572
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:53,450
simple it's effective people<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't</font>

573
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,310
using it and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the reasons</font>

574
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">is when you tell people use two-factor</font>

authentication that range<font color="#E5E5E5"> of switches</font>

576
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,900
off it sounds boring it sounds

577
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:04,100
complicated it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fluent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Tim and I</font>

578
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:07,460
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why cybersecurity</font>

579
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:09,860
resonates as well and because it sounds

580
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,630
people of grasp hold of it it sounds

581
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:16,219
understandable it sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

582
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:18,560
they can relate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so essentially</font>

583
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,030
language matters because we're trying to

584
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,490
convince<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to care about something</font>

585
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:25,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they don't understand there is no</font>

586
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:28,160
point as an industry as working on

587
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:32,450
something on as gathering<font color="#E5E5E5"> data on us</font>

588
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:34,640
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be precise unsecured if we</font>

589
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,560
can't effectively share that with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

590
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,720
people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually make a difference</font>

591
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,600
who are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a front line</font>

592
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,070
clicking on fishing links giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font>

593
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:48,959
data

594
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:51,210
downloading malware so for me a bridge

595
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,299
has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> built and we need to use it as</font>

596
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:55,830
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> industry we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people to listen to</font>

597
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:58,980
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't we always complain that we</font>

598
00:25:55,830 --> 00:26:02,549
aren't given enough time and attention

599
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:04,649
and resource in an organization well we

600
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:07,168
can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and then complain when</font>

601
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:10,559
they use a team and they're interested

602
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:13,110
but we don't like that Tim so

603
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:17,629
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me it comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down to what</font>

604
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:20,158
is our<font color="#CCCCCC"> goal is our goal in cybersecurity</font>

605
00:26:17,629 --> 00:26:22,709
about being the most technically

606
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,929
accurate is it about using teams that

607
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:28,289
for us make the most sense and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

608
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:30,740
feel are right or is it about actually

609
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:34,259
enabling the business effecting change

610
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:37,440
making people organizations and society

611
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,669
more secure and I mentioned press

612
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ratcliffe earlier with one of his</font>

613
00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:44,460
comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my response in his response</font>

614
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:46,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to my pole and he said what I'd</font>

615
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically concluded as well which is</font>

616
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,719
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need a public focused glossary</font>

617
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:53,610
of security teams and resources we need

618
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like yeah we've got nest we've</font>

619
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:58,830
got all sorts of definitions that we can

620
00:26:56,549 --> 00:27:00,658
use but they don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply to the</font>

621
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,850
public they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really apply to the</font>

622
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:05,309
media they aren't particularly relatable

623
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:08,158
or accessible so don't we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need something</font>

624
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:10,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">that makes this a bit more relatable to</font>

625
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,419
the public now<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may have heard</font>

626
00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:14,730
everything that I have said today<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

627
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:18,230
cybersecurity and you may still of

628
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:20,960
course think no I hate cybersecurity and

629
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:24,450
which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are perfectly entitled to do</font>

630
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,480
but while you may hear cyber and think

631
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:29,850
this when the general public hear your

632
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,470
whining about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> they will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably hear</font>

633
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:37,649
this so I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier William</font>

634
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:41,460
Gibson and cyberspace coining the term

635
00:27:37,649 --> 00:27:43,168
and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 1980s of cyberspace and I</font>

636
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,110
watched an interview with him as to why

637
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:48,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">he chose cyberspace and he said he went</font>

638
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:50,820
through other teams dataspace didn't

639
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:53,460
work an info space didn't work but

640
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:55,919
cyberspace it sounded like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it meant</font>

641
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,540
something or it might mean something

642
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,760
my whole delight was that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> knew it</font>

643
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,440
meant absolutely nothing so I would then

644
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:06,090
be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> specify the rules</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

645
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:09,450
arena so you may think that quote

646
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:12,120
contradicts what I've said today because

647
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:14,070
he said you know 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago it meant</font>

648
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,899
absolutely nothing I would argue that

649
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:18,990
now it does mean something people do

650
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:21,690
relate to it but also if to<font color="#CCCCCC"> some extent</font>

651
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,730
that is still true if it still doesn't

652
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:26,160
quite mean something if it's not quite

653
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:27,660
as tangible as it could be then aren't

654
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,610
we the people who should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be specifying</font>

655
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,580
the rules if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> public and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the media</font>

656
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:34,889
have grasp hold of this concept if we

657
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,720
want them to grasp hold of it if we want

658
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:39,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to engage with them then shouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

659
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,180
see this as an opportunity for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

660
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:44,780
start shaping what cyber actually means

661
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:48,300
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back to my bridge metaphor</font>

662
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:51,300
trying to build and use that bridge to

663
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,100
relate with them if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions</font>

664
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,740
or comments I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> love to hear them</font>

665
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:58,740
and whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to make those now</font>

666
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:02,640
or while<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm around today or feel free</font>

667
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:04,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to email me or tweet me and I haven't</font>
