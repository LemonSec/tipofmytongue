3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,690
perk you up a bit and make this as

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,990
interactive as possible because I know

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:29,759
how sleepy i get after lunch okay so who

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:37,920
work for a security vendor okay infosec

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:45,170
teens okay sis admins and what what are

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:52,920
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of you a side of humans no okay</font>

you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> very quiet okay cool so first of</font>

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,230
all a bit about me I like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> scare</font>

11
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,850
people this is another key post-lunch

12
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:06,720
technique scare people with a giant face

13
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:09,720
so I'm lead data scientist at a security

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:14,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">company called sensor net we do we're</font>

15
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:19,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">working on a unified platform for web</font>

16
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:23,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi-factor and email and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> water come</font>

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:27,960
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a longtime community organizer</font>

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,720
and presenter mainly in the sort of

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:35,280
Microsoft at don't hold it against me in

20
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,960
the microsoft and the our worlds and for

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,150
my sins microsoft made me a data

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,179
platform MVP if you're for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people</font>

23
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,820
who

24
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:50,190
came to the our session today I'm

25
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,000
starting to we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to organize</font>

26
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:57,500
worldwide conferences kind of similar to

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">the London b-sides and the whole besides</font>

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,690
franchise and they'll be free on

29
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:09,090
Saturdays very cleverly named as

30
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:13,440
consequence I put a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff on</font>

31
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:15,480
github so all the materials from today

32
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,300
including my workshop earlier and

33
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:24,359
various other presentations<font color="#E5E5E5"> can all be</font>

34
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:25,980
found on there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I blog you tweet so you</font>

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,190
know if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> contact me</font>

36
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:33,179
afterwards you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can and I have little</font>

37
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:35,609
business cards down there as well here's

38
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:40,940
what we're going to cover today because

39
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:43,890
I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at ways we can improve</font>

40
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:47,850
how we're doing things with our security

41
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:52,380
data so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look at the</font>

42
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:55,140
actual data problems that we maybe have

43
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,010
right now and then look at people

44
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:04,369
processes and tools so the key things

45
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:04,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that make up how something gets handled</font>

46
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so data</font>

47
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:20,099
we have an increasingly large amount of

48
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:24,779
devices between BYOD and Internet of

49
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:28,349
Things there are there is more bits of

50
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:31,739
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> traveling around and with all those</font>

51
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:33,839
disparate streams it's getting quite

52
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,890
tough to actually bring it all together

53
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:41,610
and analyze it so that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key</font>

54
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:45,828
challenges for me is how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get stuff</font>

55
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:48,329
in a consistent format and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

56
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:57,329
even get things like consistent date

57
00:03:48,329 --> 00:04:01,140
times together software then come out to

58
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:04,739
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the cyber security software</font>

59
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:10,529
market is massively growing and we've

60
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:14,940
got new vendors all the time so it's no

61
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:18,899
longer you're never just going to have

62
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,789
one bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of security software you're</font>

63
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">always going to have multiples and you</font>

64
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:25,830
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that data out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to those</font>

65
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:30,500
different systems and into something

66
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,500
where you can combine them together cuz

67
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:39,479
yes many attacks are on a single front

68
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,570
but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not always true and being</font>

69
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:46,620
able to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> data and provide that</font>

70
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:51,240
broader view point to supplement the

71
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:55,139
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> from one friends with</font>

72
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,210
another very handy and we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

73
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:03,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to access that from our software</font>

74
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:06,180
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> grab</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the World</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Economic Forum</font>

75
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:09,070
produced like a Gartner Magic Quadrant

76
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:12,190
of risks

77
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:16,900
and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them is cyber attacks you</font>

78
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:24,640
know it's a leader in<font color="#E5E5E5"> world risk so we</font>

79
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:30,159
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be increasingly vigilant and I'm</font>

80
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:34,870
sure I don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of be bang</font>

81
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,330
bang glass eyes on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point otherwise</font>

82
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:42,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">you will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not be here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learning how to do</font>

83
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:48,430
your jobs better ok so what people

84
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:53,310
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> or can be involved in helping</font>

85
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,310
your organization get better with data

86
00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:02,410
so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key people is actually bi</font>

87
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,470
analysts the people have business

88
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:08,260
intelligence departments or report

89
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,270
chimps or you can call them any

90
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:14,020
disparaging name you<font color="#CCCCCC"> like but their job</font>

91
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:17,260
is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make numbers look pretty yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

92
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:19,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">so these people their job for a living</font>

93
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:23,349
is to get data from different sources

94
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:26,890
and put it into a consolidated format

95
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:32,560
and build reports and get insight out of

96
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:35,320
it so if you're stuck and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

97
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,050
get more value out of your data then

98
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:41,140
it's worth going and feeding them some

99
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:45,940
cakes bribing<font color="#CCCCCC"> them and getting them to</font>

100
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:49,270
help you because they are experts in

101
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:51,940
what you're trying to achieve in terms

102
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:54,940
of getting the data consolidated and

103
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:57,670
then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got data scientists like me</font>

104
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:01,170
you know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> missing my mac and my</font>

105
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:07,180
blazer and I'm not from San Francisco

106
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:10,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">but they're statisticians data miners</font>

107
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:15,449
these are people who can help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get an</font>

108
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:18,169
expected in sight<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of your data</font>

109
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:21,779
but they generally need the data to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

110
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:24,900
consolidated in some format because most

111
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:29,490
data scientists are not data engineers

112
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:33,258
yet another hip term and they find it

113
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:37,469
difficult to bring that data together

114
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:44,879
and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always worth remembering that</font>

115
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:47,879
when we're when we're actually working

116
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,949
on being better with how we're

117
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:53,120
processing our data is thinking about

118
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:57,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">who the specific audiences are the</font>

119
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:00,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">information I give to my sis admin is</font>

120
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:04,580
very different to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information I give</font>

121
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:07,589
to my CEO about the latest level of

122
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:10,258
denial of service attacks that are

123
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:12,749
coming into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business and again this</font>

124
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:16,349
is actually where a bi person can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

125
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:18,110
you get and get more practice at

126
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:21,930
pitching the right level of

127
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:24,539
notifications and<font color="#E5E5E5"> content because it</font>

128
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:28,289
says admin needs things that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

129
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:31,349
act upon<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the system safer yeah</font>

130
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:34,860
infosec people usually need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able</font>

131
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:38,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to verify their actions are taken and</font>

132
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:42,269
work in a often<font color="#E5E5E5"> an audit type capacity</font>

133
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:45,930
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see EXO's needs high-level</font>

134
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:47,550
reassurance or their pants being scared

135
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:50,239
off so that they give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you plenty of</font>

136
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,240
budgets I

137
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:01,410
so the process is I really like coffee I

138
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:03,930
wish we had more coffee you all could do

139
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:07,079
with some right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now because like me</font>

140
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:13,709
you're feeling that<font color="#E5E5E5"> slump that's trying</font>

141
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:15,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get you to just snooze but to be able</font>

142
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:19,100
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> better with data we need</font>

143
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:23,699
processes in place that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> help us</font>

144
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:27,600
a make sure we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't miss anything B we</font>

145
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:30,360
do it in usually in a compliance and

146
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,780
auditable fashion and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

147
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:37,590
to actually ideally move fast and do

148
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:43,980
that whole agile bi agile development

149
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:48,690
type stuff so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing is how do</font>

150
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:56,370
you construct that<font color="#CCCCCC"> YW from a process</font>

151
00:09:48,690 --> 00:10:02,400
perspective and the aim is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get is to</font>

152
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:05,820
have a regular check that says can I get

153
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:09,120
some data that supplements my existing

154
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:13,710
information so gives me an added

155
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:17,880
dimension like if i get if i can manage

156
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:21,690
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get have I been pwned data via the</font>

157
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,150
API can I be combining that with my ad

158
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:28,530
to be looking at potentially compromised

159
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:32,490
accounts and be able to act on them so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

160
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:35,339
can supplement my existing data with

161
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:41,310
another source to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that is</font>

162
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:44,400
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult otherwise can I get</font>

163
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:52,319
data that compensates for a flaw<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my</font>

164
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:55,850
existing process so with sensor net we

165
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:59,790
have proxy we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> agents that sit on</font>

166
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:02,430
machine on people's machines but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

167
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:05,610
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> help when people are trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

168
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:08,589
get to assets that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

169
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:11,800
from machines that aren't on the network

170
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:16,800
or known on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so we can</font>

171
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:21,130
compensate by adding in the access logs

172
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:28,000
from those assets to identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gaps</font>

173
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:34,649
in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> agent deployment process and then</font>

174
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:38,320
informed so if we've got lots of

175
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:43,269
activity about that a specific person is

176
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:49,000
performing then they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> look quite</font>

177
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:53,500
dodgy you see this person going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to box</font>

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,260
Dropbox and a whole load of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever FTP</font>

179
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,839
sites and things anything what the hell

180
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,209
are they doing why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they going to</font>

00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:03,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">these sites and it's only when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

182
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:07,449
actually bring in something like their

183
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:12,820
ad like the ad schemer and see that they

184
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:15,010
are that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with partners or</font>

185
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,540
brokers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see that actually</font>

186
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:22,689
they're just disseminating information

187
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:29,560
as they'd expect so<font color="#E5E5E5"> being able to give</font>

188
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:33,480
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> added dimension really helps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

189
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,479
when you're building that view

190
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:40,419
there's a few things that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

191
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:44,309
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on one is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ETL pipeline</font>

192
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:50,109
to us extract transform bloat standards

193
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:52,839
like database jargon what your process

194
00:12:50,109 --> 00:12:57,639
needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take into account is how do you</font>

195
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:59,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">get data ideally programmatically what</font>

196
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:02,709
transformations do you have to perform

197
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:07,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get it into an acceptable format and</font>

00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:09,998
then where are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you storing it and of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">course when you're producing all this</font>

200
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:17,889

00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:26,499
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through so with sense that stuff</font>

203
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:28,419
we monitor application actions so we

204
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:32,709
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a lot of email addresses</font>

205
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:36,129
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially sensitive comments</font>

00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:39,248
between people in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> details so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

207
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:44,829
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very careful about how we secure</font>

208
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:46,959
that data and your own internal data

209
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:53,459
sources need to be thought about in a

210
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:56,079
similar way and then time it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

211
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:59,079
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to get an accurate</font>

212
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:04,059
chain of events when all your servers

213
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:07,299
are reporting different times<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's</font>

214
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:09,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually quite hard and you should give</font>

215
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:13,839
some thought to it as to how to make

216
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:16,259
sure that everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> is reporting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

217
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,259
right time

218
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:26,690
and acquisition and prototyping so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

219
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">said earlier there are a huge amount of</font>

220
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:33,250
software vendors out there now and

221
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:35,930
there's more of us every day what is

222
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:42,200
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to become more important</font>

223
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:47,209
is avoiding vendor lock-in but also

224
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:51,050
always being ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pick up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

225
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:53,030
so instead of going I am a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft</font>

226
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,650
shop and they're never ever buying

227
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:57,170
another piece of software and less

228
00:14:54,650 --> 00:15:01,000
Microsoft<font color="#CCCCCC"> have shipped it it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

230
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,420
would say the open source solutions are

231
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:11,000
always a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great place to start so if</font>

232
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:15,380
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> worrying about security try the</font>

00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open source edition or the</font>

234
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:25,420
community edition and use that to pen

235
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:28,940
test your stuff don't use open sources

236
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:33,740
and community editions a lower cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

237
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:38,090
acquisition to be more willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

238
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:40,430
stuff at it gives you more data it gives

239
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:43,400
you more insight and hopefully it gives

240
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:48,079
you better security by being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to try</font>

241
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:52,490
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and that comes with the thing</font>

242
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:54,830
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> prototyping even big vendors will</font>

243
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:57,170
depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> size and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how much you</font>

can use them will usually give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a</font>

245
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:04,610
proof of concept time if you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> work at</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">trialing stuff to see what data what</font>

247
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,710
insight you can get out of it and then

248
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:13,699
if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't work out be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to</font>

249
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:17,380
dispose of it that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I have</font>

250
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:20,870
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of companies though that</font>

251
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:23,510
because it can take a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to</font>

252
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:26,320
implement a piece of software they then

253
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:28,670
feel almost obliged to

254
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,790
to stick with it it's a sunk cost

255
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:34,219
fallacy it's much better to jettison

256
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,949
something even if you put a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

257
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:44,210
effort into it than it is to keep going

258
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:49,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">with something substandard okay on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

259
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:52,910
some of the tools you need a database

260
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:56,239
this doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be a relational one</font>

261
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:59,660
so if you're a no sequel fan it doesn't

262
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,220
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be tables but when we're</font>

263
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,970
bringing data from lots of different

264
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:07,190
streams together you need a place to

265
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:13,270
store it and you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to add</font>

266
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:13,270
the supplementary information so if

267
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:22,970
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at if you have your web</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">locks and you're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something pretty</font>

269
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:29,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool like keeping an eye out for</font>

00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:32,600
vulnerabilities noted on twitter with

271
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:36,590
hashtags or if they get a cool logo and

272
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:40,820
a nice website then you need to be

273
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:44,179
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter pipeline and then</font>

having<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> etl on a process that then</font>

275
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:49,340
says these are the things i need to look

276
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:52,010
for in my logs and then go through and

277
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:56,419
look for them it's a lot easier if that

278
00:17:52,010 --> 00:18:00,020
data is all in one place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideally</font>

279
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:02,090
well thought about I'm still very

280
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:07,430

the buzz word data lake well there's

282
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:16,550
this great new concept dump it all in

283
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:18,830
and index later okay the developer

it's okay we'll get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> schema that's a</font>

288
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:33,949
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea you need to know what's going</font>

289
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:36,669
on with how your data is collected how

290
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:41,830
it gets stored and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get shipped</font>

291
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:45,279
you you need that provenance you need

292
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:48,369
that metadata it's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> very well having</font>

293
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:51,359
a non-relational database but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

294
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:54,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend the time when you set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up the data</font>

295
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:57,309
inserts into it to actually specify

296
00:18:54,369 --> 00:19:05,769
what's likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come from the source</font>

297
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:09,029
that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working with dashboarding</font>

298
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:12,549
dashboarding is really important for

299
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:16,539
being able to get stuff out part of it

300
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:18,820
is being able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to distill your alerts</font>

301
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:22,720
down so especially if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

302
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:25,899
consolidated system but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

303
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:30,489
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like scar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> man's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blanc and stuff</font>

304
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:34,178
and with cabana with<font color="#E5E5E5"> elasticsearch you</font>

305
00:19:30,489 --> 00:19:39,879
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to integrate alerts</font>

306
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:43,899
from a load of different systems picking

307
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:45,969
which you know charts and things to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

308
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:48,668
is quite important and again this is

309
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:51,779
where a bi analyst can come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> handy if</font>

310
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:54,820
you have one laying around because if

311
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:57,100
they're a good bi analyst and they

312
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,259
should know solid data visualization

313
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,840
principles and should be able to help

314
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:08,769
you inform the audience for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

315
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:13,449
dashboard so if it's if it's a dashboard

316
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:15,609
for you and your tacky who doesn't like

317
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:19,749
charts and you really like your tables

318
00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:22,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">of data then make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it that way but if</font>

319
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:25,779
it's for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your info SEC team what do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

320
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:28,210
need how do they need it represented and

321
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:29,799
if it's for you CEO you need to use

322
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:34,929
release trip away as much detail as

323
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:39,210
possible and just<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave some gauges I'm</font>

324
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:43,870
not too cynical about them I hope

325
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:46,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can buy them in I'm actually</font>

326
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:50,379
quite a fan of the Microsoft power bi

327
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:54,100
stack at the moment it has this

328
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:56,169
fantastic Q&A capability so once you set

329
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,959
up your data and you have some

330
00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:02,620
visualizations people can actually write

331
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:07,690
queries against the dashboard so they

332
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:12,610
can say how many 500 errors did I get on

333
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:16,779
this page yesterday so you can do a lot

334
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:19,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">of exploratory analysis just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

335
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:21,639
dashboard so people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't you widen up</font>

336
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:25,360
the audience of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who can</font>

337
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:27,309
perform the analysis and then if it's

338
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,678
something of interest something that's

339
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:32,379
worth tracking then you get to you can

340
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,049
pin it to the dashboard so you can

341
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:40,418
evolve dashboards without making code

342
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:44,350
changes on the flip side I actually

343
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:48,340
quite like code based dashboards so I

344
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:54,689
use a lot of our and there is a package

345
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:58,600
called shiny which makes interactive

346
00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:04,000
applications without you ever having to

347
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:07,299
code HTML CSS or configure apache it is

348
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,730
run on pixie dust I don't understand how

349
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:13,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">it works but it is super impressive and</font>

350
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:16,809
all you need to be able to code to use

351
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:20,379
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our so you can set up your data</font>

352
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:23,379
sources bring them in memory your dump

353
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:25,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">csv es you can produce regular reports</font>

354
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:28,959
in it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have a whole lot of</font>

355
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:32,860
different parameters to make life easier

356
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:35,500
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do exploratory analysis</font>

357
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:38,199
and they can do configurations and

358
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:42,909
things like that that's great if you

359
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:45,450
want to specifically target a view of

360
00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:45,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">your data</font>

361
00:22:51,250 --> 00:23:00,250
okay elk I should I kind of felt like

362
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,139
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of showing that the web page</font>

363
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:05,490
that i should show an actual picture of

364
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,960
an alch anybody working with

365
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:12,340
elasticsearch<font color="#E5E5E5"> logstash cabana at the</font>

366
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:16,180
moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so for those of you who</font>

367
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:20,050
aren't if you need log data<font color="#E5E5E5"> at last the</font>

368
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:24,100
elk stack is really handy it can do

369
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:27,909
streaming data and it can do bulk

370
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:30,790
uploads so log stash is your log

371
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:35,050
shipping tool it's the bit that get to

372
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:40,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">your data from a to be in the format you</font>

373
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:42,520
need so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a correct if you</font>

374
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:47,740
need if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a weird date-time stamp</font>

375
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:51,550
because some developer thought he wasn't

376
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:55,180
gonna do epoch he was gonna do second

377
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:57,490
since 1900 for some crazy reason you can

378
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:01,180
specify that so you can solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

379
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:05,170
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the data is in transit then</font>

380
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:07,330
you've got elasticsearch which is it

381
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:09,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically builds indexes over your data</font>

382
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:14,470
that you can tell tell it which indexes

383
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:17,830
and make it a very fast search so it's

384
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:21,340
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> for exploratory work and then</font>

385
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:23,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cabana is a dashboarding system that</font>

386
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:26,770
sits over the top of it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets data</font>

387
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:30,550
real-time and shows you does more

388
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:33,190
dashboarding stuff and it's quite easy

389
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:35,950
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to build and configure their</font>

390
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:40,590
own once you set up the right

391
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:45,460
connections to elasticsearch it's

392
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:47,820
anybody using docker I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font>

393
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:51,820
hitting all the buzz words by the way

394
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:55,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well docker is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great tool it</font>

395
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:57,460
means I never break my machine it means

396
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:59,678
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just break my docket container and</font>

397
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,980
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because I break it and I</font>

398
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,570
start again so<font color="#E5E5E5"> dr. is like a very light</font>

399
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,290
beer

400
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:11,010
and you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a docker container with</font>

401
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:14,129
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> elk stack in and just basically say</font>

402
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:16,350
hey I want to play with<font color="#E5E5E5"> elk in a command</font>

403
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:20,220
line and it will spin up and you can

404
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:28,469
play so it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to get</font>

405
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:32,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">started with and prototype you guys know</font>

406
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:35,480
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk and stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft are</font>

407
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:38,990
actually doing some interesting things

408
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:42,180
very they're keeping it quiet but their

409
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:47,670
operational log stuff is quite

410
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:49,890
interesting and they're also fishing in

411
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:53,190
the same space that sensor net up

412
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:58,770
because you can upload logs from what

413
00:25:53,190 --> 00:26:01,140
your users have been doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and identify</font>

414
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:05,460
what cloud applications they've been

415
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:07,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">using so that that can be quite handy</font>

416
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:15,930
and you can set it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to automatically</font>

417
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:20,389
ship the logs to and then there was no

418
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:25,260
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was going to cover the myriad and</font>

419
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:30,450
plentiful tools that are available that

420
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:35,100
help you manipulate data better into a

00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:14,460
I left it as the data deluge so it's

00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,510
awake which is good I would I'm

434
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:27,389
impressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> for myself and nobody's died</font>

435
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:32,250
yet so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good so there's a lot of</font>

436
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:34,680
data and if you're not using it then its

437
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:37,650
of no value so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not using it</font>

438
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:41,670
lose<font color="#CCCCCC"> it save yourself the storage costs</font>

439
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:45,660
or get using it<font color="#E5E5E5"> put something simple</font>

440
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:49,650
over the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> begin with try out</font>

441
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:54,300
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source tool a little prototype</font>

442
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:59,840
can be a real use case as<font color="#CCCCCC"> to whether</font>

443
00:27:54,300 --> 00:28:02,550
some things of value to you people in

444
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,709
much the same way that everybody bribes

445
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:07,530
the sysadmin with cakes i highly

446
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:12,000
recommend bribing your bi people to help

447
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:15,240
get that knowledge that and get that

448
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,830
helping hand developers can actually

449
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,890
also help in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this respect because a lot</font>

450
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:26,250
of them will have been working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

451
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:28,830
non-relational search capabilities so if

452
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:32,790
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do elasticsearch which</font>

453
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:39,720
is based on leucine then a developer

454
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:42,050
might come in handy focus on who you're

455
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:45,630
the shoe you're delivering the data to

456
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:49,620
and in what format don't overwhelm

457
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:54,270
people with the wrong info and the wrong

458
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:56,250
level of detail always make sure you're

459
00:28:54,270 --> 00:29:03,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">right at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> management decisions are being</font>

460
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:03,650
made on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you will lose so much</font>

461
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,520
it's really important to be right when

462
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,490
you're providing people with information

463
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,340
so

464
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:17,650
if you can script it and write unit

465
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:20,678
tests and things against it that is a

466
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:24,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">fantastic way to go and that's a big</font>

467
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:28,570
reason why I use<font color="#E5E5E5"> are as opposed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

468
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:32,649
GUI based solution because I can code it

469
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:37,620
I can test it and then tools there are a

470
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:41,860
lot of tools out there ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

471
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:44,620
exploration are very useful you need

472
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:48,219
somewhere ideally with your data to be

473
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:50,919
consolidated into and then you need or

474
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:58,360
you don't need but specialized tools

475
00:29:50,920 --> 00:30:03,250
that help you do specifics can can be

476
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:06,639
very they can save<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a lot of money in</font>

477
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:17,490
the long run if they help stop something
