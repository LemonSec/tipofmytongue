conducted on<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience code so the agenda</font>

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,640
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> today and first we'll talk about OMG</font>

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,800
in general their position in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android</font>

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,529
ecosystem how do you affect how they

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,019
affect our devices and the differences

9
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,970
between the OEMs then we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze</font>

10
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,209
two different zero-day vulnerabilities

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,040
that we found in OEM code and finally we

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,329
will give out conclusions and see how I

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,430
go for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them for further form here so</font>

14
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,950
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about myself and my</font>

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,730
the mobile n in the PC field I've really

18
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,120
done a vulnerability assessment and

19
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,010
exploitation currently I work at check

22
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:02,340
also studied German so let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

23
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:05,459
our vices what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually get when we</font>

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,500
buy a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android device so first we</font>

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,789
have the Linux kernel with few

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:14,360
modifications for Android like a binder

27
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:16,909
wakelocks power management modifications

28
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,799
then we have the android project

29
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:22,560
abbreviated AOSP<font color="#E5E5E5"> android open source</font>

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,030
and can be filled by anyone it contains

<font color="#CCCCCC">filmworks to expand the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> android</font>

33
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,200

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,560
essential<font color="#E5E5E5"> user mode code for the</font>

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,380
operating system next we have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chip</font>

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">suit code which brings both current</font>

37
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,899
levels for the hardware like levels for

38
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,920
the camera for the GPU but also smooth

39
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:49,950
code for communication will be horrible

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,899
next we have the OEMs which rings which

41
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,930
bring unique customizations into our

42
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,090
devices this unique features come both

43
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,079
in the form of how the modifications

44
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:04,710
such as edge screen in u.s.<font color="#CCCCCC"> samsung</font>

45
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,439
androids all the power bottom on on the

46
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,568
back of LG devices but also in the form

47
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,599
of social modifications such as

48
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:14,040
differences<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the UI or different</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Bible applications</font>

50
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,599
now it's important to mention<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some</font>

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,900
devices share the same feature with

52
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:24,298
different implementations and finally we

53
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,030
have the carrier with some times partial

54
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:29,640

57
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,109
market<font color="#CCCCCC"> share in the United States is</font>

58
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,760
fragmented<font color="#E5E5E5"> unequally and there are few</font>

59
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:44,700
large OEMs which show the marketplace

60
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,459
among themselves so it's enough to find

61
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:51,540
a vulnerability in a major OEM to affect

62
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:54,120
a large portion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the market</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now other</font>

63
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,548

64
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,379
low standard of security and<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore</font>

65
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:01,620
the code was agitating the search<font color="#CCCCCC"> of new</font>

66
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:04,230
vulnerabilities however as the time

67
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,599
passed this problem received more and

68
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,899
more awareness and efforts were made to

69
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:12,108
improve the security of the OEMs this

70
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,870
efforts came both<font color="#CCCCCC"> for my third body</font>

71
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:20,280
contributors the OEM themselves and form

72
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:22,829
google so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google started to enforce new</font>

73
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,780
security mechanisms into<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android which</font>

74
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:27,299
really increased the security statement

75
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,310
of all the OEMs an example for a

76
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:32,609
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> mechanism that I personally</font>

77
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">liked is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CTS or compatibility testing</font>

78
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:38,699
suit CTS is a neat testing framework for

79
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:41,429
vulnerability for vulnerabilities so

80
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:43,169
once one ability is published a new test

81
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,299
is written to check whether the

82
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:48,090
vulnerability step presents on a device

83
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,909
or not now all the devices must pass

84
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,500
this test if they don't pass it<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

85
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:54,900
won't receive a certification from

86
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,709
google and therefore they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> act many</font>

87
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:01,220
essential features like<font color="#CCCCCC"> google play a</font>

88
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:04,889
google hangouts and many other features

89
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,689
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google is protecting us third-party</font>

90
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:09,569
developers contributed the security of

91
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:14,780
Android and OEMs are getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> better and</font>

92
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:17,639
better<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway it is safe or not and</font>

93
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:20,548
according to android vulnerabilities

94
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:23,820
that old LG received the highest score

95
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:26,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">for being a secure OEM we decided to see</font>

96
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,780
where this course is justified or not so

97
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:33,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">we started a short</font>

98
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:36,090
a bug hunting project on LG devices so

99
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,950
and when we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack a mobile</font>

100
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,260
device there are two main attack vectors

101
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,690
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have local at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vector and</font>

111
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:08,280
our college story now it's for the local

112
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:11,280
attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lord attacks vecto means that I</font>

113
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,460
have uniquely identify of four device it

114
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,739
can be a phone number imei it can be a

115
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,750
mess<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be an email address</font>

116
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,030
diseases that is associated with the

117
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,760
device and I can coordinate my tech

118
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:26,849
specifically against this identifier and

119
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,830
therefore against device now usually the

120
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,830
user interaction in this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attacks</font>

121
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,599
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> from minimal to nothing and therefore</font>

122
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,270
this attack vector is considered much

123
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,630
more dangerous however with that said

124
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:41,580
and this attacks are not so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

125
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">complicated and therefore they are not</font>

126
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">so common so let's start with the local</font>

127
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:49,590
attacks and we start with the point that

128
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,780
we have an application installed on the

129
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:55,229
device and so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas that we can</font>

130
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,150
walk on from this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point for example a</font>

131
00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:00,750
privilege services that have no Bank

132
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:03,150
permission native memory corruptions<font color="#E5E5E5"> non</font>

133
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">started services like unique sockets</font>

134
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,830
that accept connections and can be

135
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:10,490
attacked and there are many<font color="#E5E5E5"> others so</font>

136
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:13,530
let's talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bank permissions</font>

137
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">android loves applications to export</font>

138
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:19,859
functionality to other apps using

139
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:22,710
services but<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously an app will not</font>

140
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:28,229
want everyone to access it sometimes

141
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:30,030
privileged capabilities so the bind

142
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:32,430
permission feature allows applications

143
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,830
to restrict the use of this exported

144
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:38,430
functionality now this feature is used

145
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:40,440
both by Android native apps OEM internal

146
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,490
services and even by third-party

147
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,039
applications

148
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,560
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example for your use of the service</font>

149
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,690
let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you want to read the code</font>

156
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:05,750
permission can access and reduce data so

157
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:08,340
how does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually walk on a device</font>

158
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:11,699
let's take<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook and messenger for</font>

159
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:14,099
example Facebook exports<font color="#CCCCCC"> a service</font>

160
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,259
called cross<font color="#CCCCCC"> passos</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> logout service that</font>

161
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:19,050
allows our applications to log the user

162
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:21,270
ads from facebook now let's say that we

163
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,340
use messenger and we log out from

164
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,889
messenger messenger will attempt to

165
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,810
connect to the service<font color="#E5E5E5"> use its</font>

166
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,330

167

<font color="#CCCCCC">the main facebook app however</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we are</font>

169
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,750
a flashlight application we're not

00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,389
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to access this</font>

171
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:42,120
service so what happens if we try to

172
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:44,610
access it we get the permission denied

173
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,120
exception how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> obtain this</font>

174
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:50,580
permission in order to get it we have to

175
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,909
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> signed by the same developer key like</font>

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:56,719
Facebook's key so sinful since<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook</font>

177
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:59,699
and messenger a doucher the same key a

00:07:56,719 --> 00:08:01,380
messenger can access and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can</font>

179
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:05,490
obtain this permission and access this

180
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:09,930
service so with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in mind time to</font>

181
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:14,490
start research so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we decided to go for</font>

182
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:17,039
all the LG applications that export some

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,409
sort of functionality but does not

present on all qualcomm based devices

210
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:31,279
now it's a hybrid demon and

211
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:33,829
unfortunately there is no source code

212
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,660
available for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so we had to reverse</font>

213
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:39,349
engineer it to understand how to

214
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:41,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">communicate with it now it's the main</font>

gateway<font color="#CCCCCC"> a communication to the film well</font>

216
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:48,319
we're talking mainly about the network

217
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:50,660
so Wi-Fi Bluetooth gsm modem but also to

218
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,279
something called mini OS which is an

219
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,430
internal interface to test the device

220
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:58,910
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important thing about it it</font>

221
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:00,979
received comments from LGA<font color="#CCCCCC"> t CMD service</font>

222
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,350
which were connected to thanks to the

223
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,970
missing<font color="#CCCCCC"> bank permission so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can you</font>

224
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,810
actually do once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're connected to</font>

225
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:12,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">this a demon we can read private</font>

226
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:15,589
identifiers like imei serial number and

227
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:18,349
etc and it can help us coordinate our

228
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:21,019
attacks against the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device we can also</font>

229
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:23,870
override this private identifiers which

230
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:26,000
are supposed to be read only and we can

231
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,940
reboot the device without any prompt

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,519
notification and we can therefore we can

233
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,430
prevent the user from doing stuff we

234
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want me to do like deleting us and</font>

235
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,359
we can switch between in the different

236
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:41,240
USB<font color="#E5E5E5"> modes and therefore we can prevent</font>

237
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,399
for example a communication with the

238
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,910
computer so we can prevent backups or

239
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:49,370
from an upgrade using the USB and we can

240
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:52,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">even go more offensive and we can wipe</font>

241
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:55,290
the device completely again without any

242
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:57,180
prompt on tification to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> user we can</font>

243
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,880
read the device if my<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion isn't</font>

244
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,800
enough and my favorite<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

245
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,350
permanently lock the device is gsm modem

246
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,709
and this is also proficient after a

247
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:10,170
white and we sent our device to a lab

248
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:13,320
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they could fix it so shouldn't it</font>

249
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,449
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe to test it now combining</font>

250
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,400
all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> features together</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

251
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:21,390
create a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful type of viruses at</font>

252
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,670
the cost of no permissions so the

253
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,400
exploit flow we have malicious

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:33,570
and we want to connect to LGA TCM<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

257
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:36,570

can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and start communicate with</font>

260
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:44,730
it and now let's say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to</font>

261
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:47,130
issue a lock gsm modem comment so we

262
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:50,640
send this comment to LGA TCM the service

263
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:56,189
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass this command to a TD which</font>

264
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:57,930
eventually locks device now we

265
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:01,620
responsibly<font color="#CCCCCC"> disclose this one I will it</font>

266
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,479
to LG and they fixed it we receive the

267
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">CV number for it and if you have the</font>

268
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,270
newest<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of LG you are protected</font>

269
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:13,980
otherwise<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't install malicious a</font>

270
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:16,860
tic-tac-toe games ok so we're having<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

271
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,840
local attacks let's aim higher as I've

272
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,790
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> before a remote attacks are much</font>

273
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,760
more complicated and the attack back

274
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:27,300
toll is really now so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually</font>

275
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,880
start and we started to go for all the

276
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,280
LG applications which we can remotely

277
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,140
communicate with knowing just the phone

278
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:37,560
number of the device so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was talking</font>

279
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:39,930
before about a unique identifier device

280
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,270
so in this case we took the phone number

281
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:45,989
now Reese implications can be identified

282
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:48,090
because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> must have some remote rated</font>

283
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:51,690
permissions like the ones with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you here</font>

284
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:53,510
and then formally permissions here a<font color="#CCCCCC"> wah</font>

285
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:56,250
push is the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting one because</font>

286
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:59,100
there's there's lots of binary data that

287
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,990
has to be processed<font color="#CCCCCC"> on our victim and</font>

288
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,170
comparison to other communication ways

289
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,400
so before we talk about what push we

290
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:09,719
have to understand first

291
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:11,459
how text messages walk so all the text

292
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,030
messages are based on a protocol called

293
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:17,070

what is the length of the text and etc

299
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:32,790
now an advantage for us in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this country</font>

311
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,840
therefore we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that it could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be it</font>

312

interesting place to search for new

337
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,450
this protocol an update feature and

<font color="#CCCCCC">adelaide feature the update feature</font>

00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:15,360
allows us to update<font color="#E5E5E5"> the expiration dates</font>

340
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:16,410
and the URL<font color="#E5E5E5"> so sometimes they wanted to</font>

341
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,740
prolong the

347
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:38,609
was some native library but LG on the

00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">other hand there the completes different</font>

349
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:43,589
implementation they implemented purely

00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:48,600
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java in package called web service</font>

351
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:52,410
dot apk +<font color="#E5E5E5"> s the unique implementation so</font>

352
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,060
was the unique vulnerability so let's

353
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:57,540
examine the code in what put in web

354
00:15:54,060 --> 00:16:02,878
service that APK that passes this

355
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:04,439
message and and it handles it so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

356
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the call from the manifest of the</font>

357
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:10,379
application as you can see a component

358
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:14,579
that handles<font color="#CCCCCC"> the WAP Push messages is</font>

359
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:19,019
called lot push push receiver and it

360
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:21,839
tells all the WAP Push messages and now

361
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:25,709
let's see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code the telus it so</font>

362
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,899
eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> it goes to sender validity</font>

363
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:31,439
check main I'll just summarize it for

364
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:34,259
you we get to two main different

365
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:37,310
functions process s I message and

366
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:39,779
process SL message both<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:42,540
supplementation or implementations of

368
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:45,329
the WAP Push met a protocol and they

369
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:47,339
contain the same vulnerability so i'm

370
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:49,620
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you the vulnerable cornell</font>

371
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:52,980
and give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few seconds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if you</font>

372
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,620
can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yourself and the vulnerable</font>

373
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,810
code is both in the update and in the

374
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,819
delete features this is the delete

375
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:03,209
feature the implementation and this is

376
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:04,829
the update implementation take like 15

377
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:06,918
seconds to see if you can find it

378
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,918
yourself

379
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,279
eight

380
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:27,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so push handle dose dot s I ID is</font>

381
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,100
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> unique identifier of the message and</font>

382
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:34,200
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't supply any unique identifier</font>

383
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:42,370
or URL becomes the identifier now and

384
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:45,340
what happens if i send this URL so there

385
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:48,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a SQL injection vulnerability which</font>

386
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:51,360
can remotely be exploited we can delete

387
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:54,189
or update any text message on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device</font>

388
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:58,120
ever if it's not push away push message

389
00:17:54,190 --> 00:18:00,970
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> message that's why if it and even if</font>

390
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:03,820
we did not send it so any text message

391
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:07,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the device so how do we exploit this</font>

392
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:10,330
vulnerability and in order to send the

393
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:11,830
update or the deletes a message durham

394
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,470
the device must already have a

395
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:17,230
pre-existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> or push message now we</font>

396
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:21,090
don't want to take any risk so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

397
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:24,370
feel first send a normal<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> push message</font>

398
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:26,500
now now we're sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is a push</font>

399
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,659
message on the device so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> send our</font>

400
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:32,920
malicious update or delete message

401
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:35,500
against any existing normal message so

402
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:39,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do that and then we update or delete</font>

403
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:41,590
any content that we want now we

404
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:45,040
responsibly also disclosed this

405
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:47,770
vulnerability to LG and the issue we

406
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,050
receive the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CV number for it and they</font>

407
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:52,420
fixed it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Allison you have the newest</font>

408
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:56,919
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of LG i can start deleting your</font>

409
00:18:52,420 --> 00:19:00,640
text messages right now so let's see a

410
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:05,080
demo of the exploit now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

411
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,840
see it delete primitive so on the right

412
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:11,020
we have the victim we just have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

413
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,330
the phone number of the victim and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

414
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,990
victim has to be connected to adjacent

415
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:18,399
network so anything will do the job and

416
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:21,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">the attacker is on the left the attack</font>

417
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">is connected to a gsm RM so we can send</font>

418
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:27,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">raw videos to the device so as I've said</font>

419
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,780
before the device must already have a

420
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:32,580
push message

421
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,580
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just send one</font>

422
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:49,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so from this point on we can start</font>

423
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:53,450
exploiting the vulnerability immediately

424
00:19:49,880 --> 00:20:03,260
but just out of curiosity let's see how

425
00:19:53,450 --> 00:20:06,380
the message looks when we read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

426
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,629
so service measure messages since this

427
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,340
protocol was only it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> many tended to</font>

428
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:12,890
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by the mobile carrier</font>

429
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,709
there is no phone number<font color="#E5E5E5"> here it only</font>

430
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:17,720
shows service message and your<font color="#E5E5E5"> abilities</font>

431
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,820
available is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> text that i chose I</font>

432
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,130
could send any texts i wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font>

433
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,980
thought that this text looks genuine so

434
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:35,750
that's what I chose now let's see how it

435
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:38,090
looks when we open it so obviously you

436
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:40,670
won't receive a phone update form a

437
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:45,080
meteor that<font color="#E5E5E5"> old again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can choose the</font>

438
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:47,120
oil and now once we know that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

439
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">wap message of a push message on the</font>

440
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,879
device let's start deleting some

441
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,880
messages

442
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:11,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so unless you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> newest</font>

443
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">version a version of LG if you want to</font>

444
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,420
protect yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> against this attack you</font>

445
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:18,270
have to turn on airplane mode take out

446
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:20,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">your sim plug it into and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> non LG android</font>

447
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:23,639
device receive the text messages there

448
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,950
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> flag your sim back to your LG</font>

449
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,850
android phone which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much our</font>

450
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:31,650
particle now using this vulnerability

451
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:34,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are lots</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of malicious activities</font>

452
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:36,060
that we can do for example let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

453
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,180
that I hacked your bank account and I

454
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:41,100
change your password so i can just

455
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,960
delete this your bank account password

456
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,659
has been changed message that you

457
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,760
usually receive and we can even aim

458
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,560
higher and use it for you want to run

459
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,750
somewhere so let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i delete all</font>

460
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,730
your text messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I send you a</font>

461
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,620
new one if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want your text back pay</font>

462
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:58,100
me otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will wipe your entire</font>

463
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:01,830
device I didn't write but it right box

464
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:05,550
sorry I didn't write but it's my truck

465
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:08,280
and everything the inbox text messages

466
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:10,080
is also very powerful we can it is

467
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,960
possible to craft sophisticated phishing

468
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,419
attacks for instance let's say that your

469
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,450
bank sends you a text message<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

470
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:21,570
link<font color="#E5E5E5"> to download the application and I</font>

471
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:25,740
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just modify this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tag to look like</font>

472
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:27,689
this and I can like change the oil I can

473
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:31,770
point it to my malicious application I

474
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:34,320
pointed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new website and my new</font>

475
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:36,870
malicious website can look<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

476
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,080
homepage of Bank of America and hope

477
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:43,800
hopefully or hopefully not you will put

478
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,050
in your very valid credentials and our

479
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,570
bankers like Jim boats and a scar do

480
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:52,260
that allowed locally so doing this

481
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:55,379
remotely is even much more powerful so

482
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:58,020
we found the local<font color="#E5E5E5"> a local exploit</font>

483
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,810
exploit a vulnerability and<font color="#E5E5E5"> remotely</font>

484
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:04,940
exploitable one how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> time do you</font>

485
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:07,560
think that this entire research took us

486
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:12,480
it took<font color="#E5E5E5"> us just 5 days this is</font>

487
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:14,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">ridiculous I mean it's 2016 hey oils are</font>

488
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,900
still not doing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good job and of</font>

489
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,330
securing the devices

490
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:21,450
unfortunately we still can trust them

491
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:24,419
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolution for security is required</font>

492
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:27,090
but with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that said if you compare the</font>

493
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:30,440
situation to five or six years ago and

494
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:33,060
will in a much much better position

495
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:37,530
stepping into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much more secure</font>

496
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:40,590
world but some work is still a<font color="#CCCCCC"> so much</font>

497
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:42,840
easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be done so thank you very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

498
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:47,959
and if you have questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

499
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,959
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the microphone and go ahead</font>
