1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,230
thanks everyone hear me okay yeah mom

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:10,050
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodding heads as cool okay want to</font>

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,990
talk today about Laura it's a radio

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,910
protocol that's actually taken a lot of

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,640
interest and a lot of investment

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,080
recently so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font>

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,240
little bit just to introduce it to you

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,400
and also just to understand it from a

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,948
security point of view so if you were to

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,609
run into it or consider it what you need

11
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">to actually think about so first of all</font>

12
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,450
just obscene you to explain what<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

13
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,250
earth this is and talk a little bit

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,870
about the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> features of it and</font>

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,850
then actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and look at okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we</font>

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,379
understand security features how do we

17
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,719
attack this system or you know how do we

18
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,718
build a system that can withstand attack

19
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:52,050
introduction to myself first and I've

20
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,339
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> with MWR since 2011 you've probably</font>

21
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,739
seen me here<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple years ago I've</font>

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,719
done a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> work on Android and so</font>

23
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,440
it's awesome to be moving on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

24
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">about something new I run our company's</font>

25
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,930
operational technology practice where

26
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,880
we're looking at embedded systems

27
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,880
industrial systems and radio technology

28
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,080
another quick pro tip if you're

29
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,169
considering starting a research project

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,090
make sure there's a hilarious talk title

31
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,070
you can get from it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Laura the</font>

32
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,299
Explorer was the obvious choice but you

33
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">can be really really difficult when</font>

34
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,020
you've got a presentation and you can't

35
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,740
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a title for it so let's do</font>

36
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:31,470
the other way so back in 2015 in the

37
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,780
autumn we decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to a conference</font>

38
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,420
that's not a security conference we try

39
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">to branch out and we went to a utility's</font>

40
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,130
conference and this was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> European</font>

41
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,780
utility week this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is masa this is</font>

42
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,658
kind of like an infosec for the

43
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,720
utilities area so everyone from Siemens

44
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,420
right through to a small sort of Chinese

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,548
startups selling and smart metering and

46
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,380
things like that everything in this

47
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,670
space all the new technologies and we

48
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,960
were there to just talk to people to

49
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,490
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can to you</font>

50
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,030
bringing up what new protocols are you

51
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:06,060
using and we had to obviously brush up

52
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,989
on the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of protocol we expected them</font>

53
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,340
to use and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we kind of have these</font>

54
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,690
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of assumptions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well we're</font>

55
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,470
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to this conference so let's</font>

56
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,450
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure we</font>

57
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,380
understands agree security that okay

58
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,670
Epis in VT le that we totally get that

59
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:23,850
so we got there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the on the first</font>

60
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:27,359
day we we actually found I think maybe

61
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:29,070
two vendors using any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those all the</font>

62
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,280
others were using completely different

63
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:34,200
radio technology which was quite awkward

64
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,790
but also really exciting so the first

65
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,589
evening we went back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our rooms and</font>

66
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,000
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of reading as much as we can</font>

67
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,670
so we could have a conversation within

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,440
the next day so why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this happened and</font>

69
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">we not already kind of solve radio</font>

70
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,980
they're not already protocols out there

71
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,130
why of everyone now jumped in this

72
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,390
sector at least two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones and</font>

73
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can break it down fairly quickly</font>

74
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,290
like this so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have sort of the</font>

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,540
range of the protocol at the bottom of

76
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,519
how usage at the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if we want to</font>

77
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,590
send things<font color="#E5E5E5"> long range if we need this</font>

78
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,270
to work over kilometers<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we'll</font>

79
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,890
probably use a cellular network will

80
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,510
probably maybe need to satellite if it's

81
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,570
you know there's no cells house nearby

82
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,310
if for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit closer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to home and</font>

83
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,290
we maybe want to improve the bandwidth a

84
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,030
bit okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> great we have Wi-Fi we have</font>

85
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bluetooth very established technologies</font>

86
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:21,750
nice and easy well recently we've seen

87
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">this area solved and this is ok what</font>

88
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,920
about sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of personal range or sort of</font>

89
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">within a small building that's very very</font>

90
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,119
low power so this kind of home

91
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,920
automation side of things that now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

92
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,750
don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trail power cables or</font>

93
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,339
through your house because you know it's

94
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,709
a wireless isn't runs on a battery of

95
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,510
the years which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> great the gap is</font>

96
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,940
obviously here the utilities for

97
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:45,450
transport this is a really exciting<font color="#E5E5E5"> area</font>

98
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,859
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could solve it could you come up</font>

99
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:50,070
with a radio approach call that works

100
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,620
over many many kilometers but doesn't

101
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,299
have the the sort of drawback of needing

102
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,100
a lot of power you know constantly going

103
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,780
out to replace battery needing some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

104
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,730
of maintenance connection it just

105
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:05,160
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work all the time and this is</font>

about will sacrifice that we're only

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,380
worried about bandwidth this has become

possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> using one of several</font>

modulations which are going to in a sec

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,500
the other factor is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it must be cheap</font>

125
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,820
that these chips these transceivers

go through in a second need these remote

00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,620
nodes to just be across a city and if

131
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,140
one gets run over by a<font color="#CCCCCC"> car who cares</font>

00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,580
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pounds if it you know</font>

00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,320
is to measure<font color="#E5E5E5"> river</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flood levels so</font>

146
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,090
these things are distributed around the

147
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,409
river when they sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of obviously</font>

148
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,109
measure that the water levels up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

149
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain it they then report back</font>

150
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,660
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> logistics is another one that's</font>

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of interesting I didn't think of</font>

152
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,710
until I was talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the area</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's a lot imagine if</font>

154
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,210
you've got like the containers like

155

reefers<font color="#E5E5E5"> selectively refrigerated units</font>

156
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,510
and you know they're being carried on

157
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,460
shit<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're a truck there across</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> temperature is well either you're</font>

160
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,320
going to have to have a lot of power

161
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:05,800
draw or you can just have these small

162
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:07,599
devices now that are using<font color="#CCCCCC"> lp1 so</font>

163
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,570
there's a few modulation technologies

164
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,160
and it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much at the moment</font>

165
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:16,990
between ultra narrowband unb and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Laura</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Laura is actually a spread spectrum so</font>

167
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,420
ultra wide and then you have

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,450
ultra-narrow that sort of the two

169
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,830
competing modulations narrow band is

170
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,420
just coming in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'll have a look at</font>

171
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:28,599
sort of who's investing in what in just

172
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:30,310
a second but the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of narrow band is</font>

173
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,370
could we use existing cellular

174
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:35,470
infrastructure to offer this kind of LP

175
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:38,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">one solution a little bit more</font>

176
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:40,229
theoretical not as mature and as the top

00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:43,929
of the bottom one that

178
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:46,449
we're looking at companies weightless<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

then everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> would just jump to that</font>

just offer you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer the ability</font>

semiconductor manufacturers also the

00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:04,870
telcos are super interested in this

237
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:06,160
because it can offer a whole new service

238
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,630
you've already got all this networking

239

infrastructure how about you can now

240

offer an IOT service on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

signing up as alliance members or

actually investing orange weirdly if you

00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,440
see they're actually doing both they

245
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,990
invested something like 60<font color="#E5E5E5"> million euros</font>

box is also Europe that's spreading

00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:51,760
through to Asia so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea of</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of LP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one so why choose Laura</font>

257
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,660
there's there's a whole bunch here why

258

<font color="#E5E5E5">not go look at sick box or one of the</font>

first of all Laurel and the the mac

261
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:06,130
layer and the a player open source

262

<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone can go on their website today let</font>

me get<font color="#CCCCCC"> typing your email address Dylan</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you can download the full specification</font>

265
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,730
so for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> research point of view that's</font>

266
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:19,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">awesome it's not a theoretical thing</font>

267
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:21,010
it's had a huge amount of investment in

268
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:25,030
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cities in Europe including</font>

00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:26,860
London so it's not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a theoretical</font>

270
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:29,920
thing there's actually sort of value in

271
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:32,530
helping people at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stage also it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">not just turning off your lights and</font>

00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,680
I've seen talks on that before and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

annoying<font color="#E5E5E5"> Laura when laura has already</font>

been talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used for</font>

277
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,640
actually quite safety critical things so

278
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,620
there's already been a paper produced of

279
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,890
how you would use this to automate

280
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,560
railway level crossings how you and I

281
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:55,330
looked at one system and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was being</font>

demoed it's the European hoods news

conference there was a burglar alarm

284
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,750
based on this and also a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying this is great you can put this</font>

286
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,660
into your crash<font color="#CCCCCC"> pad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your national</font>

287
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,330
infrastructure critical infrastructure

288
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,540
and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to run wires isn't</font>

289
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:11,050
that

290
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:14,459
brilliant well yes potentially yes but

291
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:16,899
we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about the security of it</font>

292
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:18,969
so walking around the conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

293
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:20,709
obviously you start trying it big but

294
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,060
just like going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

295
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:23,589
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk tech to the people all</font>

296
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,768
stands<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally because it's mostly</font>

297
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:28,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">sales stuff and so when I was asking</font>

298
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,550
about it's like a Laura this is great it

299
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,949
was what's the security is fully secured

300
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:37,779
how does it do that oh it sees it<font color="#E5E5E5"> AES</font>

301
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:39,250
one's way right yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and so I</font>

302
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:40,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">started going to them and saying okay</font>

303
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,060
apart from using aes-128 how does the

304
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,949
security work and just the stunned look

305
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,529
that obviously stolen that only tangler

306
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:50,829
and they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> using so at the moment</font>

307
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:52,420
there's nothing really<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there and as</font>

308
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:53,888
I say you can just download the spec but

309
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,599
that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> heavy going if you just</font>

310
00:11:53,889 --> 00:12:00,069
need to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to advise someone within</font>

311
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,440
five minutes it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> good a lot as a</font>

312
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:04,449
consultant I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of have to also expect</font>

313
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,040
this kind of questioning i'm going to

314
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:08,469
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone asked me we want to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

315
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:12,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">for x is that fine would it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work is it</font>

316
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,510
safe or alternatively we got to we're

317
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:15,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to use two gateways we want to use</font>

318
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,959
which one should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used due diligence</font>

319
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:21,189
we want to look at security<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

320
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,899
products which one's better so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

321
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:25,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the presentation on the research from</font>

322
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:27,490
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of october till now to say the</font>

323
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,920
following and to say whether it's even

324
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,480
possible to use it securely to find out

325
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,849
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it what's your</font>

326
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,269
key controls and then to actually try

327
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,980
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say okay here's a white paper with a</font>

328
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:43,360
list of tests and if you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

329
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:44,350
and use and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at a system so</font>

330
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,480
that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we work we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at the</font>

331
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,829
specification how to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at anyone</font>

332
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,990
who's actually releases stuff yet see

333
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:51,638
how they've done it beauty paper and NS

334
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:55,079
you see if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually need to produce</font>

335
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:57,730
any tools to be able to test it properly

336
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:59,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's what we've done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so i keep</font>

337
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:03,910
using the word<font color="#CCCCCC"> Laura and Laura when</font>

338
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:06,790

341
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:15,519
is the bit I'm actually more interested

342
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,290
in at this point this is the delay with

343
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,880
the security on it this is sort of the

344
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:23,800
mac layer and above and that's a no

345
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,800
standard so we can tear that one apart

346
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay let's say we actually on to build a</font>

347
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,170
Laura system now we sort of talked about

348
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,240
these various<font color="#E5E5E5"> components is only going</font>

00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be three according to specification</font>

350
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,260
you have no do you have gateways you

351
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:40,910
have network servers nodes are these

352
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:45,590
small devices I've got one here which is

353
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:49,189
all cabled up and very very cheap this

354
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:50,570
one's made by microchip there that these

355
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,800
n nodes are going to be the things that

356
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,870
you distribute around they're going to

357
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,640
be things with sort of a real world<font color="#E5E5E5"> io</font>

358
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,810
kind of control they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

359
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,189
monitoring stuff they're going to be

360
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:01,550
taking commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe you know</font>

366
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,950
gateways there's going to be far fewer

367
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,570
of them they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be powered and</font>

368
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:20,210
they're going to then report back to the

point some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interface for the</font>

373
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">design that entirely up to you what you</font>

374
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:33,200
then may have is if you're like

licensing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this at service is you can say</font>

376
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok company X you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can have these nodes</font>

377
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,780
and you can build<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own application</font>

378
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:40,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">server and I'll know to pass all that</font>

379
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:45,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">data through to you and you can control</font>

380
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:47,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">them so this connection entirely up to</font>

381
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,590
you could be using cellular networks

382
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,940
could run cables anything you want

383
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:52,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't really matter obviously needs to</font>

384
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,540
be fairly high bandwidth and then the

385
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,370
connection between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Gateway the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> node</font>

386
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:59,630
that's what's using a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> at Laurel and</font>

387
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:02,840
communicate it works on a cool reply

388
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:05,900
basis so traditional the class a setup

389
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:08,270
is that the nodes will depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

390
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,069
you program them send a message back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

391
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:12,319
your application server you know the

392
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,520
temperature<font color="#E5E5E5"> is currently 20 degrees the</font>

393
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,460
application server then has the

394
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:20,740
opportunity to reply<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok it's 20 degrees</font>

395
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,740
open the valve that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of message to</font>

396
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:27,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">understand how good the gateways are</font>

397
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:31,160
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a map of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> motion and the red pins</font>

398
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:33,189
are gateways the green area<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the area</font>

399
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,660
that you could put a node in and it

400
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:37,540
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it back to the network server</font>

401
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:39,280
so they've covered most of a city using

402
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,110
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> six gateways so it's pretty</font>

403
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,689
effective as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tell we sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

404
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:48,040
move into this deeper heavier area built

405
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:49,810
up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the range drops quite a lot</font>

406
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:54,160
I'll see out in the countryside a little

407
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,880
bit more much<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier so that's how it</font>

408
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,770
works there's only these three

409
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,220
components only two of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

talking Laura<font color="#E5E5E5"> Laura one so what does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

411
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:05,410
spec actually say about security and

412
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:08,170
imagine you were given this<font color="#CCCCCC"> write your</font>

413
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:10,270
pen tester hat on so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> how much</font>

414
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,729
have we finished we've built this it's

415
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:14,590
got a thousand nodes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten gateways</font>

416
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,480
we've already built all the networks

417
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,980
application service their parties can

418
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,960
connect in we've got all the instructor

419
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:22,360
in the meantime the attack vectors on

420
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,060
this are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mind-boggling this is a</font>

421
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,740
huge huge project you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go off to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

422
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,780
radio you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the devices you got</font>

423
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,090
to the servers then um internet-facing

424
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,130
areas what be the effective in denial of

425
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,660
service attack there's there's quite a

426
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:38,590
lot so we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break it down a</font>

427
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:40,839
little bit the way encryption works this

428
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:43,960
whole aes-128 this is the way it works

429
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:47,140
it's using symmetric encryption so every

430
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,820
node has its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique keys should have</font>

431
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,470
its own unique use<font color="#E5E5E5"> according to the spec</font>

432
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,600
it'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have an</font>

highlighted in blue now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

437
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:04,300
happen is the node encrypts using the

438
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:07,030
application session key and then signs

439
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:10,510
makes the message integrity check using

440
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:12,280
the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> session key goes through the</font>

441
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,379
Gateway gateways completely blind it has

442
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,329
no ability to decrypt message it's got

443
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,770
no access to keys it just dumbly<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ford's</font>

444
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:20,169
everything on that it sees that is a

<font color="#E5E5E5">legitimate Laura packet the network</font>

446
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">server can then it's only got the</font>

447
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:26,680
network key so it can check yes that's a

448
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:30,879
official message yes it had the right

449
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:33,160
key pass it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I know which application</font>

450
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,130
service send it to for the other fields

451
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,350
telling me which one send it to the idea

452
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,720
being it doesn't matter the network

453
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:43,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">servers owned by a telco only you can</font>

454
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,490
then decrypt it that's the idea

455
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,520
of course there's other issues of what

456
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,260
if there are two like Laura solutions in

457
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same area you can actually ship the</font>

458
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,950
channel slightly although it shouldn't

459
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:57,010
affect it too much and then these are

460
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,720
command messages command messages are

461
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,520
only sent by the network server the

462
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,050
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> server only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has one of the keys</font>

463
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,530
so it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the key for both</font>

464
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:07,270
encryption and signing so this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

465
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,860
a reply this time said by the network

466
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:16,210
server to say app could you actually

467
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:17,530
shift channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> X interesting where it</font>

468
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,360
starts getting a little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray</font>

469
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,879
around specifications how exactly do you

470
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,500
join<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new node to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the network you don't</font>

471
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">just want me a terrible person</font>

472
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,760
connecting into your to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your Lorelei's</font>

473
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,909
system you only want your official ones

474
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,440
connecting when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want them to so</font>

475
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,780
joining you have two options one you

476
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,460
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just program the keys when you're</font>

477
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,230
manufacturing them put them into the

478
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,660
nodes throw the nose out into the field

479
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:42,040
they start working they've got the keys

480
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,890
immediately so they can just start

481
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,950
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's fine the other one is</font>

482
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:50,380
more complicated is where you put you

483
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:52,150
just still put a key onto the device but

484
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,590
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the session key set up</font>

485
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,870
yet so what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is some kind of</font>

486
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,399
exchange when the node starts up using

487
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:02,800
the one key it does have to establish

488
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:05,170
the two other keys so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have how node</font>

489
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:08,590
it has a unique application key on it

490
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:10,030
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> a yes once we've so and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

491
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,770
the nodes going to send this to start

492
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,180
off with mrs.<font color="#E5E5E5"> our evil person in the</font>

493
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,370
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to listen in working out</font>

494
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,020
what the keys are so the nose going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

495
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:19,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">send a join request it's going to send</font>

496
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:22,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I belong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this application I am</font>

497
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:25,480
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> device number I've created a random</font>

498
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:28,180
number and I've signed it with my

499
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,630
athlete not encrypted just sign so okay

500
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:35,200
he can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get those that's fine so aes-128</font>

501
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:37,900
H max to sign those the server then

502
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,570
needs to generate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and another another</font>

503
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,910
month and using those value that

504
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,260
calculates what and the application

505
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:49,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">session here the network session piece</font>

506
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:51,250
should be it should also this is where

507
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,020
the specification doesn't really talk

508
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,120
about it much<font color="#E5E5E5"> it also check that that</font>

509
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,710
node<font color="#CCCCCC"> should even be joining or sending</font>

510
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,510
that message at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point</font>

511
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:03,130
and so it's kind of consideration needs

512
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:05,830
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding usually formulas ears again</font>

513
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:07,120
this is all<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> specification so the</font>

514
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,500
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to work out this way</font>

515
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,959
it's going to take the app key which it

516
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,149
also knows take the nonce the element is

517
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,000
just produced and actually produce<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

518
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:19,090
two keys it will then send yes you can

519
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,029
join and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send its app</font>

520
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:23,709
nonce back but this time actually

521
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:27,820
encrypt it with the application he and

522
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:30,250
signer so now both sides have the

523
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:34,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">information and man in the middle is</font>

524
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:36,250
completely stuck<font color="#E5E5E5"> without that so that's</font>

525
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,690
we can now join network safely to our

526
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:40,240
network which is great how<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

527
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,409
messaging itself I will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as i said</font>

528
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,000
in the diagram is going to be using

529
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:45,779
application session key<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the network</font>

530
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,770
session<font color="#E5E5E5"> key for application messages</font>

531
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:49,390
encrypt with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the app send with the net</font>

532
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:52,029
bandslam of the network the network

533
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:56,620
messages we can only use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one key</font>

534
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:59,140
that's fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok let's get a bitmap see</font>

535
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:01,209
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually using AES in counter mode</font>

536
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,059
which means it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be producing a</font>

537
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:06,100
key stream that key stream is then

538
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:08,230
getting X sword with our message and

539
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,120
that then gets sent across the idea is

540
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,200
that the server can produce the same key

541
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,719
stream because it has the same

542
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,890
information hex or it and get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data</font>

543
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,970
out again a key point of this is

544
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,520
obviously you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to produce the</font>

545
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:23,080
same key stream twice quite dangerous so

546
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,080
what it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use as these counter</font>

547
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,418
values the idea being that when a node

548
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,678
starts<font color="#CCCCCC"> its on zero every message its end</font>

549
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:32,440
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be incrementing its</font>

550
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,820
counter and then on the server side the

551
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,350
server can do the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I've received</font>

552
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,760
one from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> load increase that though</font>

553
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's counselor so it can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always produce</font>

554
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,990
the same key stream as the node but it

555
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:45,760
should never produce same key string

556
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:48,549
place the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual message goes into this</font>

557
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,309
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> frm payload is our data the metric</font>

558
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:53,168
you know it's 20 degrees whatever that

559
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:55,000
gets encrypted we then sign it with the

560
00:21:53,169 --> 00:22:00,640
message integrity check using the

561
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,980
network key so that's pretty simple we

562
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,570
can add nodes these<font color="#CCCCCC"> mosca message us we</font>

563
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,830
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> check the signing we can check you</font>

564
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:09,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">know has it been tampered with we can</font>

565
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:10,460
decrypt it great class b is to what

566
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,690
they've done when

567
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,070

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,630
when added Class B systems similarly

578
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,580
you'll have times where the network

579
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:42,560
needs to message you where you want to

currently this the node that way can

00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,960
then receive all of those messages which

590
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:09,410

00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:22,699
to talk through that gateway to talk to

596
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:24,740
it so useful to update the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

597
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,540
then received in the node the node now

says<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm now synchronized with the</font>

time sent from that gateway message I

600
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,050
now know at X seconds I should listen

601
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,610
and because you only have this short

602
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,290
listening windows you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can sleep for a</font>

605
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:44,629
multicast messages so now you can send

00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">one message to all the devices because</font>

607
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:50,390
you know they're all going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

listening at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

609
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:55,430
that that's that's all for the technical

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it is actually secure you can</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine these systems are going to be</font>

far more complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that you can have</font>

613
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,130
engineers pulling stuff out all this one

broke this one's<font color="#CCCCCC"> parrot you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

615
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,270
latency let's redirect everything all

616
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:10,879
the network service for all over it's

617
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:13,430
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be incredibly complex so how do</font>

618
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,200
we test it let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> break it down so</font>

619
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,090
messages some things we can do very very

620
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">quick first of all obviously check</font>

621
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,409
signing for encryption this is the kind

622
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,630
of stuff that's in the spec

623
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,310
and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an official lower Alliance</font>

624
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:27,590
device you must have passed their tests

625
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:30,100
that ultimately it's probably on you

626
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:33,800
depending on your role to develop this

627
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:36,050
and implemented securely so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't</font>

628
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,879
check<font color="#E5E5E5"> the signing before the encryption</font>

629
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,139
there are several attacks we can do if

630
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,640
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> incrementing our counselors</font>

631
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,080
properly then we're producing the same

632
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,160
key stream that can be dangerous if

633
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:48,350
we're sharing keys around and yeah again

634
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,710
a lot so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> please don't do this it's</font>

635
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:53,870
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you to actually implement that so</font>

636
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:56,090
what happens if we were to decrypt

637
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:58,760
before we check signing well given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

638
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,709
we're XOR announced using a key stream

639
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,660
it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start swapping bytes so</font>

640
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:05,270
if I know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> structure of the message</font>

641
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:08,870
as an attacker<font color="#CCCCCC"> it roughly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that those</font>

642
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,820
bites here will always be 24 is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

643
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:14,000
sex or again so if I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> start flipping</font>

644
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:18,010
bits then I can charts changing the

645
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,570
values without knowing what the key was

646
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:21,890
obviously the mixture of a signature

647
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">check should just catch that straight</font>

648
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">away but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you to implement f</font>

649
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,800
counter manipulation so denial of

650
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,150
service attacks with these kind of

651
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,520
systems is probably going to actually be

652
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:34,640
quite expensive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

653
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,379
cryptolocker attack is also the big

654
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,090
point is with counselors is they should

655
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:41,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">always increment if you get one lower</font>

656
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:48,260
then that's out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sync</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or you know it's</font>

657
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:50,570
rubbish discard it so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were to be</font>

658
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,980
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send a message with the counter</font>

659
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:54,439
set to the maximum<font color="#CCCCCC"> value you've just</font>

660
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,270
bricked that node that node will just be

661
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:01,640
ignored from then on so pretty dangerous

662
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:04,639
obviously check the link first and if

663
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,230
the council if you replaying that using

664
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,600
the same key stream then you have the

665
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:10,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity to X or stuff else because</font>

666
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,810
you're saying keystream being<font color="#E5E5E5"> XOR</font>

667
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,460
therefore if you're to encrypted

668
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,990
messages and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the plaintext</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

669
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:20,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">one you can get the plain text of the</font>

670
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:22,310
other jeep your keys is pretty obvious

671
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,139
there's big message say please<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't use</font>

672
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:26,870
them but it's up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or again</font>

673
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,850
guessable keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you're basing it</font>

674
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:31,250
off you know the mac address or

675
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:32,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">something equivalent been then it's</font>

676
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,950
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start just sending your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font>

677
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,949
messages as<font color="#E5E5E5"> anna packet</font>

678
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:44,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mac</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only messages so were these are the</font>

679
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:47,440
network messages change channel do this

680
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:50,590
do that only uses one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the keys so</font>

681
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,360
again we actually if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do get that one</font>

682
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:56,110
key then what then we're in an extra do

683
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,699
quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of damage the commands you</font>

00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,379
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> send to mention some of</font>

685
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,090
these you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the status you can</font>

change data rate transmit power<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel</font>

687
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:07,629
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all proprietary so yeah potentially</font>

688
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:10,689
these messages are less secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

689
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:12,100
using one key now and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

690
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:15,760
could actually do<font color="#CCCCCC"> to damage your system</font>

691
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:18,219
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's really interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

692
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,350
some companies clearly don't get the

693
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:23,679
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network keys by themselves are</font>

694
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:25,629
and sensitive they've obviously assumed

695
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,429
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got an appt session key and</font>

696
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:29,710
I don't know it so it's fine so the

697
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:31,720
things network is hobbyist thing so

698
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:34,510
totally fine they're doing this as is in

699
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,830
London<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well but for the hobbyist</font>

700
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:37,390
community you need to know the network

701
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:41,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">session key that the network is going to</font>

702
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:42,909
use so that's on their website so anyone

703
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:45,640
right now could produce something to

704
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:48,220
knock over brick any<font color="#CCCCCC"> note that's</font>

705
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:54,760
currently on the things network in any

706
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:56,350
country<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok the over-the-air signing and</font>

00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:02,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that as well you know we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

709
00:27:58,149 --> 00:28:04,570
worry about whether we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could rejoin if</font>

710
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,000
we can send it again produce new nonces

get new session Keys<font color="#CCCCCC"> you leave the</font>

712
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,029
actual no doubt in the dark because it's

713
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:11,850
got the wrong ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a server</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

just think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> delicious and ignore it</font>

715
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:15,580
similarly if we're able to guess the

716
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:18,270
keys we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of attacks</font>

00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:24,549
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the specification and this is</font>

720
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,520
where some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most interesting</font>

721
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:30,279
attacks are you've got to have a server

722
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,010
that the network server and potentially

723
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:35,890
application servers can access to get

724
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:37,210
those keys to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decrypt and</font>

725
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:41,169
read the messages but also to send

726
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:42,520
replies now that's a potentially a

727
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:45,549
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of failure and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then a</font>

00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:47,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">really critical asset that you want to</font>

729
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:48,020
worry about who's got access to that

730
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:50,900
database what

731
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:53,330
so that database was cryptolocker your

736
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,990

00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,420
with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you some of the</font>

743
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:22,360
we'll probably pull the part at some

744
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:24,110
point in try and work out how they work

745
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,760
allora know is probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

746
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:27,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this the antenna you're</font>

747
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,720
going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your transceiver that does</font>

748
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,550
all the encryption and signing so that's

749
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have all the keys in it some</font>

750
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,520
kind of connection the one I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

751
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,409
you are connection it goes to a

752
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,480
microcontroller that then does all the

753
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:40,460
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of business e logic that's sort of</font>

754
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,680
reading whatever measurement it is

755
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's sort of producing a message sends</font>

756
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:48,950
it to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Laurel and transceiver and</font>

757
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:50,810
that's then gets sent out so the nodes

758
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,280
must have these keys they should be

759
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:54,860
unique per node that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be an</font>

760
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:57,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting one to test yeah this is the</font>

761
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,310
transceiver I've got here and so

762
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,080
normally your microcontroller we're

763
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:03,919
connecting to these pins and then you

764
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,120
can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> use this to send so so</font>

765
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,770
potentially we can steal<font color="#CCCCCC"> the keys from</font>

766
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">the node we can also try going after the</font>

767
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:10,790
firmware because it must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pausing the</font>

768
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,920
bilayer at least or the microcontroller

769
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:14,450
might be pop doing pausing on on the

770
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:18,350
actual application data that's being

771
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:20,750
sent so it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting so could</font>

772
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:22,310
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just pull the keys out what is its</font>

773
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:24,590
transceiver what is this magical black

774
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:26,450
box well if we took the shielding off

775
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:30,649
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually see it's a picture</font>

776
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:33,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">pic18 LF</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's gots debug ports so we</font>

777
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:34,700
can connect our picket debugger<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it we</font>

778
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,470
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and actually look can we pull</font>

779
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,150
the keys out have they set the registers

780
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:41,150
correctly to stop a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Packers doing that</font>

781
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:42,920
yeah actually annoyingly they have one

782
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:45,830
interesting thing is you can write to

783
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,780
individual code blocks so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> pictures</font>

784
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:50,270
let you write<font color="#CCCCCC"> to one sector and leave</font>

785
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:52,250
the rest of the code in fact you can

786
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:56,240
they have made a mistake on the flags

787
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:58,940
and to set that one block can read the

788
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,350
code from another blog so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone</font>

789
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,670
smart enough and I would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested</font>

790
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:04,399
to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you afterwards about</font>

791
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:06,230
can you write code flash to one part of

792
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the block with some kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of not sled</font>

793
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:10,880
that then reads out the memory from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

794
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,379
other sections and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll throw that</font>

795
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,170
one away to get another device right to

796
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:17,390
another sector and that way you get all

797
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:21,860
four sectors of code out who bigger

798
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:23,780
we're dumping the firmware there's

799
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing in the datasheet say there's any</font>

800
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:27,710
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of protection against this or side</font>

801
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:29,600
channel analysis and these devices

802
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:33,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have a way of measuring current</font>

803
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,300
draw exactly to that and chip so should

804
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:38,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">be fairly straightforward and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

805

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:46,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're using a secure AES library maybe</font>

807
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:49,490
we can go far far cheaper and dirtier if

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> webs if the server the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

sending anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want and the great</font>

819
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,450
thing about that is if the transceiver

has the keys it will just<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">very useful so we need to worry about</font>

823
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:25,700
those obviously internet-facing

824
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:27,530

825
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,230
chances are it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look like that</font>

826
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:32,389
that is the implementation for several

827
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:35,450
of these solutions these gateways are

828
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:37,400
just talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> out 3g dongle out over the</font>

837
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:59,389
a little bit extreme so probably

838
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:02,480
something you'd want is more like a

they have assets like this

00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:32,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">straight up says like and we don't</font>

851
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:34,610
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how you're going to do this</font>

852
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:36,260
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of support that you can so</font>

853
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:38,600
please when you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send a</font>

854
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:41,210
broadcast magically change all of your

855
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,070
nodes app keys and network keys to be

856
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,350
the same because we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send the</font>

857
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,790
same message to all of them and then

858
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:51,290
please magically change them back again

859
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:53,690
so they said they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed to send</font>

860
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:56,840
Mac messages using this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again highly</font>

861
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:58,870
up to you how you been<font color="#CCCCCC"> loads of that so</font>

862
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:02,149
class<font color="#E5E5E5"> be generally is be careful</font>

863
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:03,590
multicast messages yeah good<font color="#CCCCCC"> luck</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

864
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:06,350
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that securely it's going to be</font>

865
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:08,509
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really tricky gateway beacons get</font>

866
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,759
properly interesting because there is no

867
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:12,740
security on them gateway doesn't have

868
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,030
any keys can't do any sighting can't do

869
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:17,209
any encryption they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

870
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:20,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">sending their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS coordinates and a sort</font>

871
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:22,668
of a network time to all of the nodes so

872
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,230
first of all was an attacker that's very

873
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:25,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">easy to war drive because you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

874
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:27,230
GPS coordinates all the gateways that

875
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:30,290
potentially have a secure connection

876
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:32,870
back to the server the other interesting

877
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:35,449
thing is that the nodes are using these

878
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:38,000
values and I've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> some sort of stack</font>

879
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:39,469
overflow type chats about it everyone's

880
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,860
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> now just setting the node</font>

881
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:45,259
system time to be the message sent by

882
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gateway ok i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just received the</font>

883
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">message is currently twelve o'clock noon</font>

884
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,620
set the time to that no encryption

885
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:53,270
authentication so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea what</font>

886
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,149
would happen if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just start sending</font>

887
00:34:53,270 --> 00:35:03,320
you know first of January 1972 these

888
00:34:56,149 --> 00:35:05,029
things so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> summary having read through</font>

889
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,120
this i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it is perfectly possible to</font>

890
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:11,060
build a secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> lauren network there's a</font>

891
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:13,009
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of onus on you to put the spec</font>

892
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:17,600
properly and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement the spec</font>

893
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:19,430
properly that was obviously ridiculously

894
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,009
quick going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through this the spec is</font>

895
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:23,569
pretty big and so what we did was put

896
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:25,460
together a white paper on this but

897
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:26,470
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in this that's really</font>

898
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:30,040
downloadable from all

899
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:32,830
site it goes through each of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these areas</font>

900
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:36,670
in far more detail and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the test cases in</font>

901
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:39,130
far more detail as well the last thing I

902
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:49,900
want to do is to say obviously we were

903
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:51,490
looking at producing tools so one thing

904
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,700
I wanted to do is say well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you</font>

905
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:56,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">can get gateways to gateways are just</font>

906
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,509
packet sniffers we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do any</font>

907
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:01,660
kind of software-defined radios on this

908
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:03,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we the bilayer is black box but</font>

909
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:06,779
what we could do is take a gateway just

910
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:08,980
have it record every packet it ever sees

911
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,840
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use that to try and</font>

912
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,820
inspect to work out what informations

913
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,800
being leaked could we can actually maybe

914
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:18,250
test the keys that we've stolen off the

915
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,540
device or a server so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully this is</font>

916
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:23,650
all still running so I've got a gateway

917
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:25,150
here and what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do is I'll just</font>

918
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:29,050
send a message from a node I think this

919
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:30,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">is something like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AAA so I'm just</font>

920
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:33,460
setting all up and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make</font>

921
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:35,740
you go through a BP quickly sign up and

922
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:38,470
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gateway is going to listen now this</font>

923
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:41,020
no I've sets to just use a key of all

924
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:44,140
zeros and that's sent the message an

925
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:46,030
hour nice little<font color="#E5E5E5"> web interface in front</font>

926
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:49,150
end we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> now inspect and</font>

927
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:53,380
start parsing this traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> s'okay it was</font>

928
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:55,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">Center 1037 yeah it was so I get all</font>

929
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,880
this information which band width which

930
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,129
port it's going to so that's to do the

931
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,190
application I can then look at that

932
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:05,349
encrypted payload as well and if I know

933
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:09,000
that the key is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all zeros in this case</font>

934
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:17,530
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's just random data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on them</font>

935
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:19,109
so they look<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

936
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:21,010
pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> up random messages as well</font>

937
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:22,509
interestingly this is going to be

938
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:24,130
picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up every message I've just</font>

939
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:26,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">realized and we're currently in London</font>

940
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:29,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that might have been an actual Laura</font>

941
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,700
system in use cool and so we can you

942
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:35,560
prove this one nope that's someone

943
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:37,859
else's system as well live demos you

944
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">gotta love</font>

945
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can try and someone later on if</font>

946
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:44,410
you're interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kit I'll have</font>

947
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,970
it around for the rest of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day but</font>

948
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:48,879
it's essentially using a node so we can

949
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:50,890
generate our own messages and and sort

950
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,540
of handset all the keys so we can start

951
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:54,759
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to inject messages into a network</font>

952
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:57,579
we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a gateway so we can go</font>

953
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:01,349
wardriving or actually try and passively

954
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:03,690
and decrypt and read these messages

955
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:07,559
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything I wanted to cover and</font>

956
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:07,559
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone have any questions</font>
