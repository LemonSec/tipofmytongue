1
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:16,189
please oh thank you so Ariel Poehler

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,310
so super quick a technical background

3
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:22,590
started an Internet company in 94 then

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,180
helped a few other startups and started

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,090
another company and went back and forth

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,160
between starting and helping base in San

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,289
Francisco and they fought the past ten

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,570
plus years have mostly been helping

9
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,180
startups I was on the board of audio and

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:40,170
Twitter got incubated stumble upon

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,070
SlideShare Optimizely Flixter to some of

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,479
some of the companies I've been involved

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,299
with and then for the past couple of

14
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,909
years having focused on what I would

15
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,890
call human augmentation which relates a

16
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:52,430
lot to the previous panel for those of

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,570
you who are here and spending time

18
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:58,379
talking and looking at companies like

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,540
neo sensory or somatic labs were

20
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,820
downstairs or exoskeleton companies

21
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:06,179
think in the TVCs

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,270
space and in that space I'm actually

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,580
working with David Eagleman funding or

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:16,050
looking for great projects to fund so

25
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,520
that's the short version cool so my

26
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,320
background is also in the technology

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,060
space I helped build a few technology

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,100
companies in the median entertainment

29
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,470
business

30
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,690
Activision I das and and Disney's games

31
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,460
business over the years and then between

32
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:32,730
those I've actually had fun jobs where I

33
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,559
got to do startups from the ground up in

34
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,080
a lot of different spaces as well but

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,909
presently what I think is the most

36
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,500
interesting thing I've ever seen is sort

37
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,620
of this opportunity to do the

38
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,060
human-computer interface type startups

39
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,460
now or you have hardware and software

40
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,830
that really interface with the human

41
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,990
body and brain and allow us to do all

42
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,700
sorts of things that were less relevant

43
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,220
whenever you had things that were just

44
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,659
on a screen and so my current firm is

45
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,100
called jazz Venture Partners we do

46
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,260
investing in this world of applied

47
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,580
neuroscience where we really see the

48
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,010
brain is the next program a little

49
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,440
platform and that opens up sort of a

50
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,750
world of possibilities so you know human

51
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,170
augmentation from generally from this

52
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,170
side out

53
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,260
see a quantum interface and we're in the

54
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,579
hub showing some of our technology here

55
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,859
but it's a pleasure to be with you two

56
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,470
guys and I've been in startups for the

57
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,170
last 15 years both early stage later

58
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,640
stage so we'll get things started just a

59
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:37,670
sense from the audience or folks

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:42,510
primarily inventors makers entrepreneurs

61
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:45,179
any like how many people here are in a

62
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:48,260
company that you see there fundraising

63
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:52,650
or looking to fundraise in the next year

64
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,120
whew about how about anyone in companies

65
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,860
or projects that are gonna do it

66
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,680
bootstrap they're gonna take the hill

67
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,500
without racing okay and then any

68
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:06,780
companies that are far along profitable

69
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:08,700
or significant revenues okay great so

70
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,270
what would you say on that point then of

71
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,489
bootstrapping versus raising outside

72
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:17,340
money as far as some of these are the

73
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:21,960
pros and cons of that or things to look

74
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:24,060
out for as a entrepreneur I mean there's

75
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:28,350
no right and wrong and the first advice

76
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,700
I always give is don't listen to every

77
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,410
edge you can't follow all the advice you

78
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,910
get as you have to find what works for

79
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,400
you

80
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:38,220
so obviously if you can get where you

81
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,940
need to without racing outside money

82
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:45,120
that it's often a good thing to do the

83
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,880
flip side is investors like discuss here

84
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,040
Chas ventures who I know often bring

85
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,780
more than than than money I'm involved

86
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,670
with a number of companies were like

87
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,360
Strava it's a company where I'm on the

88
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,739
board we have done raised a lot of money

89
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,690
not necessarily because we need it but

90
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:04,290
because we find awesome investors that

91
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,970
can also help us in many ways so I just

92
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,950
find what you feel comfortable with if

93
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,270
you don't need the money then maybe look

94
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,950
for somebody that can help you and if

95
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:13,470
you do need the money also look for the

96
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,769
person who's in addition to the money

97
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:19,440
ideally gonna be value-added right yeah

98
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,120
and I look at it through exactly the

99
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,320
same lenses but the other thing that I

100
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,070
spend a lot of time talking to

101
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,940
entrepreneurs about is if you don't need

102
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,849
institutional money or professional

103
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,600
money don't take it it's the most

104
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,050
expensive thing

105
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,400
you will ever acquire for your company

106
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,020
not because they're mean people who are

107
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,060
trying to take advantage of you but more

108
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,640
because just the way that the economics

109
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,800
work out of now half of your company is

110
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,180
gone and just to get the same return

111
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,500
that you would be able to for selling

112
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,350
your own company or owning your own

113
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,800
business you need to now double or

114
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,180
quadruple or quintuple be the ultimate

115
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,100
possible outcome for your business and

116
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,600
so now you need to suddenly sold it for

117
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,880
a million dollars that's a lot of money

118
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,800
for one person but now you need to sell

119
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,659
it for ten million dollars to get it

120
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,970
between you and your co-founders and

121
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,830
early employees and investors to get

122
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,050
that same amount back for yourself and

123
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,370
so it's sort of you know buyer beware it

124
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,740
really sends you down a certain path

125
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:16,110
looking for really large outcomes as

126
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,970
opposed to being able to build like what

127
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,880
could otherwise be wonderful normal

128
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:24,060
standalone businesses is there anything

129
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,520
that you would say on that journey of

130
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,830
having an idea and kind of feeling you

131
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,109
can bootstrap not really sure if you

132
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,270
need outside money that you know you

133
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,310
would say you know there's a certain

134
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,349
point not necessarily of no return but

135
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,180
that if you're gonna do it recognize it

136
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,920
either earlier or is it okay to go all

137
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,790
the way to the end and then say well I

138
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,500
better get some money that's a fair

139
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:49,050
question what it would it I'd say to

140
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,230
sort of add for that as well is I think

141
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,580
in today's environment there are an

142
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,800
enormous number of different ways that

143
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,180
you can actually finance a company and I

144
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,890
think the good news is it's cheaper and

145
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,740
cheaper and cheaper to build something

146
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:03,780
on your own because you have all these

147
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,630
facilities now you can do 3d printing

148
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:09,510
you can actually do you know 3d DNA or

149
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,100
you do you know a DNA sequencing even so

150
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,420
like anything is now available to you as

151
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,280
a service and they're relatively

152
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:18,150
affordable so the cost of building a

153
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,190
website in you know 1990 was millions of

154
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,530
dollars and now it's you know dollars

155
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:26,310
and so like you're seeing these things

156
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,690
shrink down so and then the equally

157
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,330
interestingly is that the number of

158
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,100
financing sources that are happening

159
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,690
right now that sort of go off the

160
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,730
continuum so you used to be able to go

161
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:38,190
to just kleiner perkins to get money and

162
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,300
also in 1990 and we're finding number of

163
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,580
people and they can only rate large

164
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,050
checks and now you have you know angel

165
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,430
investors that are you know pretty

166
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,500
prolific like Ariel you

167
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,880
of crowdfunding opportunities so you can

168
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,790
actually get a Kickstarter or one of the

169
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,190
other 500 crowdfunding platforms and

170
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,410
then you can eventually make it up to

171
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,650
you know corporate strategic investors

172
00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:00,180
or any other kind of institutional

173
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,919
investment over time so I think it gives

174
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,690
you a lot more options and again to

175
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,400
ariel's point like find what's right for

176
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,630
you and what's available to it so it's

177
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,679
not like these things are really easy to

178
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:12,509
acquire and what I'm seeing a lot is now

179
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,180
you can get much farther with fewer

180
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,199
funds like john was saying but often you

181
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,160
get to a point particularly when you

182
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:23,070
have to scale where marketing and other

183
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,620
kind of things might require more funds

184
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:27,120
and that might be a time when when but

185
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,530
the good news is that by that point if

186
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,970
you've proven that there's a product

187
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,520
marketed that you have some traction

188
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,180
then you're more certain that it makes

189
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,639
sense

190
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,710
you can then get better terms from from

191
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,620
the investors and so on right what one

192
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,180
comment I would make is and this applies

193
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,650
not just to getting investors but in

194
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,050
general whether it's a co-founder and

195
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:48,989
even an employee which is once you bring

196
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,449
someone like that board a particular

197
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,820
investor you can't mean a relationship

198
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:56,760
with investor is more permanent than a

199
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,349
marriage you cannot there's no divorce

200
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,580
really because you don't have the money

201
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:04,260
to give it back them know that they

202
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:06,870
would take it so and co-founders so so

203
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,430
even if it's someone you're hiring if

204
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,560
the person who's workout it it's often

205
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,990
very traumatic to move out of that for

206
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,229
small company yeah the one thing I would

207
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:19,349
say take your time and if you do are

208
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:21,090
gonna take investor try to do they often

209
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:22,620
do a lot of the judges intrapreneurs and

210
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,719
I see mine intrapreneurs go like great

211
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,580
where's the money now do take your time

212
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,260
do the due diligence because if you take

213
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,469
money from somebody that doesn't work

214
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,059
out well with you it's exactly yeah well

215
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,919
on that point it's a great point arrows

216
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:37,859
that you know not all money is created

217
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:40,978
equal then there's somebody behind the

218
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,479
money and so as you're saying on the due

219
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,690
diligence perspective you have any

220
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,400
thoughts or comments or advice that what

221
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,890
are some of the attributes to look for

222
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,209
in that diligence process because as you

223
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,760
said entrepreneurs are so used to

224
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:55,770
getting the live autopsy of their

225
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,689
business you know then it might be

226
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,329
hesitant to actually they

227
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,250
here's ten questions I have for you

228
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,510
again very personal but I'll tell you I

229
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,280
remember when I was doing my second

230
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,830
startup I was in a fortunate situation

231
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,660
where I had a lot of BC's big brands

232
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,580
that wanted to invest and I narrowed

233
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,780
down to two then I took the two

234
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,920
individuals that's the first thing I

235
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,480
would say it's not about the firm is

236
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,360
about the individual so it doesn't

237
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,700
matter if it's jazz a coil recliner but

238
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,190
who's the person and so I took that the

239
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,770
truth I wear my short list and I invited

240
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:29,130
them to dinner at my house separately

241
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,960
and with with my wife and I had a dinner

242
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,520
with him because for me life is short I

243
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,960
want to work with people that I won't

244
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,210
have over for dinner that's like my

245
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,460
personal criteria yeah and then we

246
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,860
didn't talk shop but after that dinner

247
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,870
it was very obvious I want to spend more

248
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,120
time with this guy much more so than

249
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,360
with the other guy and that made it for

250
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,800
me

251
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,800
very make it personal food out and so

252
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:55,079
when I'll tell you the person I ended up

253
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,819
working with with Andrew anchor who was

254
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,590
the original CEO of Wired digital yeah

255
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:06,510
who was that always capital I'm not

256
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:09,840
gonna say yeah we leave that aside now I

257
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:12,450
think the personal side yeah there are

258
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,220
lots of other area things like you know

259
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,990
if it's a bigger firm you want a more

260
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,730
you don't want a junior person who needs

261
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:21,570
to get permission from someone else to

262
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:23,340
make decisions yeah no I totally agree

263
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,040
at that but I think that that is also a

264
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:28,920
very fortunate position to be in where

265
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,839
you have more options and I think it is

266
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,910
extremely important to find that right

267
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,770
fit on the flip side most of the time

268
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,959
I've been an entrepreneur I don't have a

269
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,430
lot of options and so it's any source of

270
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,720
money there's great money and then

271
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,949
people give me the advice to find the

272
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,720
right guy and it's like oh well that's

273
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,970
not so nice but right now I'm about to

274
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,970
run out of cash or you know my mortgage

275
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:50,640
is due and so on some level that what I

276
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:53,910
will say is even just you know maybe not

277
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,860
gaming the system but but you do want it

278
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,780
to be a two-way discussion with you and

279
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,790
your financier whoever it is because it

280
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,350
shows that you're actually your show

281
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,670
you're your testing them to see that

282
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,740
they care about your business or they

283
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:07,890
just think it's you know a place to park

284
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,660
some some cash in and I really do think

285
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,370
that the most interesting and productive

286
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,230
relationship start off with that and

287
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,760
that two-way relationship rather than

288
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:18,089
just knocking on people's doors with

289
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:21,810
your hand out you even start I would say

290
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:24,450
before that which is in terms of

291
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:27,630
fundraising most entrepreneurs put a lot

292
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:31,020
of effort into their pitch and all sort

293
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:32,850
of bag how they go about it and not as

294
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,310
much effort into picking the right

295
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:39,089
potential investor to go pursue right

296
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:41,279
and so often it's like okay who are the

297
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:44,190
top guys on this list or that list as

298
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,320
opposed to really looking at what has

299
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,839
this individual tweeted about or blogged

300
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,339
about or where else has the investor or

301
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,070
what kind of repetition does he or she

302
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:56,550
have and then going more precisely in

303
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:59,610
targeting and success in fundraising I

304
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:01,529
found it's so much more about fit than

305
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:04,710
about anything else I'd like to do the

306
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:06,960
analogy of updating people you obsess

307
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,279
about to do I take him or her to a

308
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,650
French restaurant or an Italian

309
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:12,029
restaurant or this flowers those flowers

310
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,279
there's no chemistry who cares

311
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:16,620
you're doomed and the flip side there's

312
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,240
chemistry doesn't matter you're gonna do

313
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,950
well so in the investors it's often the

314
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,970
same thing you talk to the right person

315
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:25,920
and it's the other thing on that front

316
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,410
too is what door do you come in so

317
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,420
having an introduction that actually is

318
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,400
credible helps a whole lot rather than

319
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,880
flinging a slide to some random

320
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,860
connection via LinkedIn right and I

321
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,510
would say just from some personal

322
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,870
experience in that area getting that fit

323
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:45,180
was super important in terms of what the

324
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,279
philosophy and the the mindset of the

325
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,750
person and particularly I was maybe

326
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,029
posed for the folks here at the

327
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:53,459
conference that might be a challenge to

328
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:56,790
find and that it's such a new area new

329
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:57,869
things are happening so who's who really

330
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,459
is that how do you get the information

331
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,750
in Ariel you said some things which are

332
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,459
great where you just go to blogs

333
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,040
Twitter's you know there's a lot of data

334
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:06,569
out there to be able to see is there

335
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,089
somebody who might be already have an

336
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,410
affinity to the work or project that

337
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,120
you're at least as a starting point

338
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:14,130
although this reminds me of something

339
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,670
else that I often say which is don't

340
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:19,350
believe anything you read or see or hear

341
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,180
about the Silicon Valley stories so I

342
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,680
mean I think my view and I would guess

343
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,050
yours as well it's very Silicon Valley

344
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,410
centric and I've been the fortunate to

345
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,819
have been

346
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,110
involved with some high-profile

347
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:30,540
companies where it was Twitter with

348
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:33,540
Yahoo and some other and then I read the

349
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,819
Zappos I read the book and I go like

350
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,550
this is not what happened and the

351
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:40,439
reality is after the fact people want to

352
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:43,199
have take credit for it people want to

353
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,600
look very strategic and the reality is

354
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:50,128
that it's often a lot more luck a lot

355
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:53,040
more fewer people that may be really

356
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:54,779
made a difference so if you look at all

357
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,670
this was the key person in this or that

358
00:13:54,779 --> 00:14:00,740
just validated before you necessarily

359
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,740
leave it because most of the stories are

360
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:10,199
you both of you touched a little bit on

361
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:12,120
in terms of you know building a company

362
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:14,819
are looking to take an idea to something

363
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,319
in the world you know there's financing

364
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:18,029
part and that's a great partnership that

365
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:20,009
has to come together and then you built

366
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:22,019
touched on briefly co-founders all right

367
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:23,430
so you can have somebody who has a great

368
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:25,589
idea and they say well I need somebody

369
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:27,388
to help me with it in a certain area and

370
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:30,449
getting that initial chemistry of that

371
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:32,069
initial that first person the third perk

372
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:34,380
you know the second person now there's

373
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:37,740
three of you and then it goes the four

374
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:39,300
and one of the things that depending on

375
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,250
the experience here is that those are

376
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:45,209
sound like small steps but could really

377
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:47,189
be monumental to the long-term success

378
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:49,290
of the company so any thoughts in terms

379
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:50,910
of not necessarily choosing a co-founder

380
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,370
but kind of how does that how do you see

381
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,899
that also relationally playing out with

382
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,329
somebody who says you know I got this

383
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:59,279
great idea I got to find an engineer or

384
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:01,319
something right so I'd say you start

385
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,269
almost with the functional needs first

386
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:05,579
unless you already come baked as a team

387
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:06,959
then it's sort of a it's a no-brainer

388
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:09,209
that you're the team through starting

389
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,670
this concept together but you know if

390
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:13,199
you have a specific deficit then you

391
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,670
really think about okay what am I good

392
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,279
at and what else do we need to get this

393
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:20,790
product in the market and usually in

394
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,230
kind of these early markets you need to

395
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,849
be the person who's capable of building

396
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:27,569
the product yourself if you want to do

397
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:30,240
it as a one-person band so you know

398
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:31,979
being early technologist we could start

399
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,290
our own companies and code our own first

400
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,819
thing and then suddenly you know then

401
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,069
you can kind of snowball around what am

402
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:40,560
I missing but there's a little

403
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:42,990
more of a momentum around inertia to

404
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,819
what what you've created if you're at a

405
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,230
point where you say I'm really great at

406
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,420
the sales and marketing but I can't

407
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:50,040
build the thing to sell or market yet so

408
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,160
I need a car technical co-founder build

409
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,529
it that's different and so you're sort

410
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,329
of looking for an equal partner as

411
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:59,069
opposed to sort of an employee to help

412
00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:00,839
you later on down the line and I think

413
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:02,870
that's still at that point then it gets

414
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,709
down to the personal chemistry you are

415
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,509
entering into a long-term relationship

416
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:09,180
make sure there's someone that you it's

417
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:10,440
really simple but you know in the places

418
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,130
it goes wrong are the same one arrow

419
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,690
over and over again

420
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,630
you trust the person would you have them

421
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,459
over to dinner at your house you know if

422
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:19,290
you've left the blank check sitting

423
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:20,670
there would you be comfortable going

424
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,959
away and coming back a week later and

425
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,939
knowing that it's still sitting there

426
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:26,369
because you are putting your financial

427
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,050
hand you know lives in their hands and

428
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:29,220
so it's just basic fundamental trust

429
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,079
them then do you trust them in their

430
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,399
functional capacity too so that you get

431
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,508
the one plus one equals three you're

432
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,980
good at what you do they're good at what

433
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:37,889
they do and together you make a better

434
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,990
combination right yeah yeah a few quick

435
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:42,060
things throughout one is clarity about

436
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,760
each person's role and responsibilities

437
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,319
so frequently I'll go and trying to look

438
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,589
at a company and it's not clear even

439
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:53,189
who's really making which decisions

440
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:56,370
clearly about things like mean ownership

441
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,779
of equity investing you want to have

442
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,569
people vesting over time sort of if

443
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:04,740
somebody leaves at least that there's a

444
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:06,540
way out and then the fact that you don't

445
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,829
need all your co-founders to come at the

446
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,178
same time I mean this might sound a

447
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:11,520
little silly but often I've seen

448
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:13,650
situations where the initial team makes

449
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,439
a lot of progress then six months or a

450
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:18,390
year later someone else comes and maybe

451
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,339
the title co-founder sometimes they even

452
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:23,100
get it but it's not relevant they might

453
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,990
come in as a principal so just know that

454
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:27,359
it can take a while and don't try to

455
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,820
force it because it's so hard to find

456
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,428
the right beat yeah it's it's amazing

457
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:35,250
how it's ultimately relationships both

458
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:37,110
within and without the company and on

459
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,720
that point it's one other kind of facet

460
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:43,320
sometimes building an advisory board or

461
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,790
people that can provide mentorship it

462
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,149
gets a lot of conversation but also

463
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:50,309
could be very meaningful to a company

464
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,510
that's starting to emerge with a new

465
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:55,170
idea

466
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:57,120
on advisory boards or a mentorship well

467
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,830
I'm pretty biased because I'm sort of

468
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,260
like a professional board member I mean

469
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:03,330
I'm always on a bunch of boards and I'm

470
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,400
usually an outside board member and so I

471
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,090
think that good boards can be super

472
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,610
valuable

473
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,810
most people Silicon Valley try most

474
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,669
entrepreneurs these days in the valley

475
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,649
try to avoid having a board or rather

476
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,540
because and I think this is true most

477
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:18,660
boards are a pain and don't add value

478
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:21,540
and they're sold this overhead yeah but

479
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,850
the flip side is that a good board is

480
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,920
super valuable and it's very different

481
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,780
from having good advisors it's also very

482
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,370
valuable yeah so advisors help you one

483
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,230
off with a thing here and a thing there

484
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,270
which is really good and you want to try

485
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:35,250
to have something as possible one of the

486
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,360
key things about the board is that every

487
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,220
other month or whatever the right

488
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,469
frequency is you're getting together

489
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,270
you're looking at the forest from the

490
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,070
trees looking at how did you do the last

491
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,620
month what are the plans for next month

492
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:49,159
and you you have somebody that you're

493
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:52,409
accountable to that you were doing that

494
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,540
so I'm a big fan of as early as possible

495
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,610
right and actually the earlier the

496
00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:01,680
better having a group of people that you

497
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:03,000
trust that can help you yeah I think

498
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,500
that's a really important point in just

499
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,210
to be clear in case anybody hasn't done

500
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,410
this yet it's Ariel's making a

501
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,150
distinction between the Board of

502
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:11,100
Advisors so there's some people you put

503
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,630
on your website that say hey these

504
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,730
people say nice things about me and

505
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,010
they'll pick up the phone when I call

506
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,230
versus your board of directors which is

507
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,870
the guy who's actually got some skin in

508
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,780
the game and some equity and is you know

509
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:26,639
really there to hold you accountable and

510
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,960
you know obviously he's like if you can

511
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,850
get somebody on your board of directors

512
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,290
that really is meaningful in terms of

513
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,810
books like us making an investment

514
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:35,129
decision versus Board of Advisors which

515
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,990
is really nice it's still good to see

516
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,250
familiar faces and your slide deck but

517
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,200
you'd be surprised at how many slide

518
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:42,480
decks have those same familiar faces in

519
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,520
them in any given space and so then you

520
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,500
get some good advice but but it

521
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,290
ultimately you know only helps so much

522
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,700
so one thought that came to mind is

523
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:53,550
you're talking in somebody's you know

524
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,830
starting with an idea in kind of which

525
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:57,930
direction to go it's like the divining

526
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:01,590
rod where you want to find the water so

527
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:03,450
some cases people say solve a problem

528
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:05,520
you got to solve a problem and other

529
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,730
people say create something new

530
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,840
so one example that's used a lot is

531
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,610
Steve Jobs when he came in with the

532
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,010
iPhone nobody knew they needed or wanted

533
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:16,050
an iPhone and he came out with it and

534
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:19,830
there was a response so when I think

535
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:21,210
about body hack here people my sense is

536
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,580
you know when we're doing some of that

537
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,080
ourselves of are we solving do we

538
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,460
solving a problem or are we creating

539
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,490
something new that nobody's thought of

540
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:32,090
before and any thoughts on that relative

541
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:35,130
to you know investment and building and

542
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:36,629
having a story so you guys right now are

543
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,820
than the space here at the Pioneer so

544
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,350
you guys are ahead of everybody else by

545
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,909
a longshot which is what makes this base

546
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,040
really interesting you're not talking

547
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,200
about you know inventing some little

548
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,059
widget that does something ten percent

549
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,620
better than if somebody else does in

550
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:52,379
Silicon Valley and we see lots and lots

551
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,939
of those businesses so out in the pipe

552
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,559
you know out in this new space there's a

553
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,900
lot of ground to cover and so I think

554
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:59,490
you can do both pretty well when you

555
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,800
have like this big of a green field in

556
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,440
front of you you guys spend time this

557
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,389
you know you know defining what this

558
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,330
space even is and so we're kind of way

559
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:11,670
out in you know an unmarked territory so

560
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:13,980
that's the fun part the bad part is the

561
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,720
pioneers or sometimes defined is the

562
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,880
guys with the arrows in their backs to

563
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,980
because you're out there carving off new

564
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,090
territory and you're helping other

565
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,980
people to figure out how even how to

566
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:25,139
describe what it is and what might be

567
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,580
interesting businesses but I do think if

568
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,090
you invent something that's truly

569
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:32,790
profound that's one way to go about it

570
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,980
that's really hard very few people get

571
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:37,740
to be Steve Jobs and invent something

572
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,590
that that you know creates a new you

573
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:43,679
know sort of a hole in the universe and

574
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:45,209
then but the other way to do it is solve

575
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,710
them solve somebody's problems for them

576
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:50,100
and I think that's the more traditional

577
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,330
way most of us entrepreneurs do and and

578
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,949
then if you actually solve something you

579
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,449
get a customer to either pay you or say

580
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,100
nice things about you and share it with

581
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,320
their friends then you're really kind of

582
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:00,300
starting to go down a path that guys you

583
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,710
know like Ariel and I appreciate because

584
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,149
you're solving a real problem with

585
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:05,100
someone who finds value in it and

586
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:08,730
usually those are how businesses get

587
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,990
bill yeah I mean I do take a slightly

588
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,910
different view in the sense that if you

589
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:15,660
look at say the iPhone and Steve Jobs

590
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:17,580
the the point is not that he did

591
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,410
something for which people didn't have

592
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:22,470
didn't solve a problem or didn't

593
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:24,450
Vanny the issue is that people didn't

594
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,740
know they had that need people didn't

595
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,760
know they had them and then all of a

596
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,530
sudden he solves it

597
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:33,300
but the need or the desire is there so

598
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:35,160
either you're solving a real problem

599
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:39,149
or a real need that it's been identified

600
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:41,010
or you're solving a need or desire that

601
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:44,520
even though it's not identified is there

602
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:46,230
but you better find validate that it's

603
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,150
there you better validate it sure enough

604
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:51,390
because what I see a lot especially in

605
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,650
early industries like this is you come

606
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:56,910
up with something

607
00:22:52,650 --> 00:23:00,180
nifty a technology a little feature of

608
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:02,160
them in search of a market right and if

609
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,810
you need more often than not it's not

610
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,860
there yeah so if you're going out of

611
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:09,120
thinking oh this is huge validate it

612
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,520
right well what the other thing I'll say

613
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,080
this is really expensive if you solve a

614
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,240
problem that people don't know they had

615
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,189
it's really expensive and time-consuming

616
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,260
to then convince them it's a real

617
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:21,690
problem and so like Palm Pilot is a fine

618
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:25,560
example of a five or ten year ride

619
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:27,420
before you know the iPhone you know so

620
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,580
that someone lost hundreds of millions

621
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,530
of dollars in seating the market such

622
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,760
that hey this really the smartphone with

623
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,010
a touch user interface that some

624
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,480
handwriting recognition or what have you

625
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:37,920
is is an interesting thing and then go

626
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,930
to the Newton before that and so it's

627
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,910
sort of it takes time and therefore

628
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:44,190
money and so either you have to figure

629
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:46,830
out how to if you're gonna take that

630
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,690
long ride you know sort of make sure

631
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:51,110
that you're spending accordingly to be

632
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:53,220
able to do it for ten years or

633
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:54,570
alternately find something that is a

634
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,180
little bit easier to connect the dots

635
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:58,560
for people right so it sounds like in

636
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:01,370
both centers you really want to have

637
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,659
some utility to that idea something that

638
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:07,139
there's something that can actually be

639
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:11,940
done eventually otherwise yeah by

640
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:14,310
yourself standing alone right we'll open

641
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:17,520
the floor for questions

642
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,990
I think Trevor just walked out so maybe

643
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,600
we can keep a couple of things going do

644
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,600
we solve a minor we can hear you yeah

645
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:45,810
I craters are awesome like they are

646
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:47,720
fantastic because that gives you some

647
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:51,000
room to push the boundaries

648
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,460
it's whatever those gray areas intersect

649
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,080
with huge regulatory bodies is where

650
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,990
they start to worry me because the

651
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:00,000
penalties are pretty stiff and quick

652
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:01,880
whenever you cross over that you know

653
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,620
boundary you're touched the third rail

654
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,210
but I love gray areas personally because

655
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,679
again it gives you room to explore and

656
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,840
innovate and find new things that are

657
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:13,320
not just like slightly iterative but

658
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,570
it's the I think for investors it's the

659
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,669
how you know is the juice worth the

660
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:20,159
squeeze right or you're playing around

661
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,990
the edges of what might be acceptable or

662
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,670
not is that going to turn into something

663
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,930
that's really big and valuable like uber

664
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:28,110
and they were certainly playing around

665
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:29,820
the periphery of cab companies and maybe

666
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,919
violating some laws and local

667
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,929
jurisdictions but the juice is worth the

668
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,970
squeeze there or as if we're doing

669
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:39,390
things that are you know highly in

670
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:41,760
violation of FDA rules then I would

671
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:43,320
probably say you know you're dancing

672
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,040
around just waiting for the for that

673
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:49,320
letter you know most investors we're

674
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,270
totally fine with risk and and our

675
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,179
preference tends to we much prefer

676
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:55,379
something with huge upside and

677
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:59,010
significant risk than something with

678
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:00,240
very low risk but less upside so risk is

679
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:02,070
not necessarily a problem then we have

680
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,050
to make our assessment well do we

681
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,899
believe this what are the odds that the

682
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:08,730
risk sinks the company or not and in

683
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:13,470
this space what I've seen a lot is it

684
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:15,690
bifurcates into the more medical things

685
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:18,120
that are more medical where clearly

686
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:21,270
there's gonna be more FDA but there's a

687
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:23,129
clearer route and and then things that

688
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:26,580
are more consumer which sometimes have

689
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:28,830
bigger upside because it's everybody but

690
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:31,230
it's less clear so often you end up with

691
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:34,199
like maybe more ups and less clear less

692
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:36,090
upside more clear and then some some

693
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,350
investors prefer one side some investors

694
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:41,939
before the others that sometimes you

695
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:48,750
have to take the right investor alright

696
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:54,540
another question I've got another one

697
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:58,470
for you guys yeah audience here anybody

698
00:26:54,540 --> 00:27:00,389
have another one so as investors when

699
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:03,210
you have that person coming in with the

700
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:05,880
idea what are some of the things that

701
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:09,120
you look for in that individual what are

702
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,760
the characteristics that you would say

703
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,770
you know it could be this great idea but

704
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,720
then there's something either there or

705
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:20,520
not there that either reinforces the

706
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:22,380
great idea or maybe says Pass and now

707
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,760
there's a personal judgement yeah yes

708
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,740
what are the attributes or

709
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,110
characteristics that I'll start out with

710
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,030
this simple one and it's not it takes

711
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:31,290
you a while to realize like this is the

712
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,790
probably the most important thing it's

713
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:35,870
back to who's a good founders who's a

714
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:38,070
good partner in business it's honesty

715
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,719
you don't have to sell someone this is

716
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:41,520
this is gonna change the world and

717
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,470
nothing's ever gone wrong and

718
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,480
everything's perfect it's like somebody

719
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,130
who actually tell you the truth what

720
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,570
they believe is the truth at any given

721
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,940
point in time thing is a clear

722
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,620
communicator is is higher value than

723
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,600
someone that can spin his story that may

724
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,610
or may not be factually correct at least

725
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:00,659
in terms of startups maybe Apollo

726
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:02,820
politics is different but uh but but

727
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:04,440
ultimately that's what you know we only

728
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,240
get an hour or two to meet someone and

729
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,530
get to know them before you you don't

730
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,790
have to make an investment decision but

731
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:10,020
you have to make a decision like do I

732
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,510
want to spend more time getting to know

733
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:14,370
this person and I think you know just

734
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:16,710
clear communicator and high integrity

735
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:19,350
goes a long way towards getting you know

736
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:22,470
that relationship rolling yeah I tell

737
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:24,449
you the few things real quick that make

738
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,040
a big difference for me and this goes

739
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,500
both for the person end up in the

740
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:30,360
opportunity first after that meeting

741
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,070
do I look back and say what's that fun

742
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,260
did I enjoy that and they'll want to do

743
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,179
more of this and if the answer is no I'm

744
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,100
done for whatever reason and if the

745
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,570
answer is yes it's like okay then maybe

746
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,780
I want to keep talking with this person

747
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:45,210
which leads to the second one is can I

748
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,830
help this founder and that has to do

749
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:48,330
both with is this the kind of person

750
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:51,129
that I think it's gonna be good at

751
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:53,919
receiving advice and leveraging me and

752
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:57,250
does this person need the kind of help

753
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,720
that I can provide so that's a the third

754
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,130
one which is do I want to have this

755
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,600
person over for dinner kind of thing do

756
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:07,960
I want to hang out and then there is

757
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,100
this this one that is tough to be very

758
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,220
specific about but it is like am i

759
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:14,800
excited and sometimes I get excited

760
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,090
because the impact this can have in the

761
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,169
world sometimes because the business

762
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,610
model is great sometimes because

763
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:21,190
intrapreneur is amazing

764
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,449
but something needs to and this is very

765
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:24,520
typical thing in Silicon Valley which is

766
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:26,530
we see so many projects it's not enough

767
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,320
to check all the boxes right there needs

768
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:34,210
to be something more so in my cases is

769
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:37,360
it exciting right well great great great

770
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:39,010
comments the you mentioned Silicon

771
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,169
Valley bill to you a couple times and

772
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:43,140
there's probably maybe a number of folks

773
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:46,740
here in Austin but also regionally

774
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:49,690
there's been some criticism in the

775
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:51,820
investment community of the investment

776
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:53,290
community in Austin in terms of I used

777
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,270
to be in the office Avengers portfolio

778
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:57,790
so not dissing them but you know they

779
00:29:55,270 --> 00:30:01,629
you know some have to say there's kind

780
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:04,450
of a lack of capital in Austin what are

781
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:06,250
your two things one is would you say

782
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:09,640
that people should really still focus

783
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:12,880
local or you know how do you see people

784
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:15,310
from Austin coming into Silicon Valley

785
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:20,200
and looking for investment from there

786
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:22,780
even though the entity is here most most

787
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:26,920
Silicon Valley investors will not invest

788
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:31,090
in a company that cannot over - I used

789
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:33,550
to say thrive - yeah change and the

790
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:35,860
reason is that particularly more

791
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:37,899
sophisticated as we get way more great

792
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:40,419
opportunities than we can invest in

793
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,950
right so the notion that we're gonna go

794
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:45,160
- it's funny because I said is

795
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:46,870
frequently - people from abroad but the

796
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,250
truth that it doesn't need to be abroad

797
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:50,010
it could be Austin or it could even be

798
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:53,170
Sacramento in the notion that you cannot

799
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:55,720
go to that trouble now it doesn't mean

800
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:57,910
we don't do it but the bar is so much

801
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,470
higher much so you really you better

802
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:03,460
have something really really special

803
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:04,690
really really unique and often we we

804
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,990
want to say okay but what about your

805
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,309
look

806
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,929
following this are your local investors

807
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:09,340
backing you and then maybe we go if your

808
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:11,700
locally miss or not backing you we like

809
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:14,379
well they're closer they know you better

810
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:17,380
but so that's the bad news the good news

811
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:19,900
is most of the places where the lots of

812
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:22,240
investors don't have that luxury so

813
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:25,059
maybe if there's not enough money in

814
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,610
Austin and you want to look beyond if

815
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:28,660
you're a base here I maybe would look at

816
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:30,520
other places

817
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:32,830
so other than silicon matter right look

818
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:35,020
at New York you look at LA you look at

819
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:37,000
Boston you look at even London because

820
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:40,809
most of those investors do need to

821
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,570
invest outside yeah and so I think we

822
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:45,460
look at it similarly like is it's

823
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,928
convenient to have your portfolio

824
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:50,170
companies near you but on the flip side

825
00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:51,640
of things for us anyway we think Silicon

826
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:53,920
Valley is a little saturated and a

827
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,990
little bit me too in terms of what's

828
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,580
happening now and there's this really

829
00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:00,640
broad statements for tens of thousands

830
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:02,350
of startups but that's just generally

831
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,440
our feeling and so we're pretty happy to

832
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:08,620
go look around but that said the capital

833
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:11,050
is largely you know concentrated in the

834
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:12,428
San Francisco area and so to get you

835
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,889
know unless you have a great source of

836
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:17,350
local capital frequently is worth the

837
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:19,929
trip out to sort of you know do the

838
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:22,780
dance with with capital in Silicon

839
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:25,059
Valley we are seeing venture communities

840
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:27,990
pop up and you know regional you know

841
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:31,470
areas there's there's a great group in

842
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:34,059
grouping in Boston and Chicago now and

843
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:35,920
and so more and more cities are having

844
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:37,570
you know get local bands of angel

845
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,280
investors and again crowdfunding is a

846
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:40,899
great way to get yourself recognized

847
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,639
there's a little bit of a saturation

848
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,559
there right now - in terms of too many

849
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:49,929
projects and I think there's a little

850
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:51,670
bit of you know kind of an harder to

851
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:53,230
differentiate yourself and get above the

852
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:55,900
noise just like it isn't anything than

853
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:57,400
the web now but nevertheless you can

854
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,320
show that there's an audience and your

855
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,510
product is interesting and get some

856
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:04,600
source of momentum before you then go to

857
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:07,570
either local or regional you know

858
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,309
venture groups right good and I'll come

859
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:11,760
back to crowdfunding for a question

860
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:11,760
great

861
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:22,500
yeah I mean it yeah it not to be you

862
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:24,089
know discouraging because I've spent the

863
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,889
98 percent of my career as an

864
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,690
entrepreneur but the numbers are stacked

865
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:29,159
against you and that's just that's this

866
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:31,020
how's it life is it to get into a good

867
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,839
college it's it's the it's a lot of work

868
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:36,630
to get to get to that point similarly to

869
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:40,910
get your business funded by you know

870
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:44,640
traditional you know venture investment

871
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:46,379
Minoo if one in a hundred gets funded I

872
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,790
think that number would be fortunate

873
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:52,410
right so it's less than that I mean the

874
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:56,100
one comment I would make in terms of my

875
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:59,490
is yes I don't meet with most of the

876
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:02,490
things I see but if it's relevant to

877
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:05,220
what I have publicly said are my

878
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:07,049
interest and for example take anything

879
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,549
in human augmentation I'm gonna take a

880
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:11,630
very hard look at because that's my

881
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:14,550
focus now I get a gaming company and

882
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:17,520
it's I'm not I'm not gonna look at it so

883
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:19,230
I go back to ya the odds are against you

884
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,790
but just like in college and then

885
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,920
actually one of my kids is in the

886
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:25,860
college process a lot of it is just

887
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,630
finding that match between the story of

888
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,250
the applicant and and what the college

889
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:31,290
is looking at is it a good fit so this

890
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:33,570
is this is a thing similar you have to

891
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:36,630
yeah absolutely you you can move your

892
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:38,640
odds by three orders of magnitude in

893
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:40,470
terms of finding the right the right

894
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,180
investor for you in you know the

895
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,589
questions are they are they interested

896
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,000
in the thing you know do you find the

897
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,800
guy who's really interested in human

898
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,110
documentation or you know do they do

899
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,210
series a investing do they do seed stage

900
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,590
investing you know can you describe the

901
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,020
difference and what you're gonna do with

902
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:56,880
the money very clearly such that that

903
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,320
fits into their to their model do they

904
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,850
invest regionally do they like to get

905
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,900
out of the region all of those things

906
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:03,060
that you could pretty much find on the

907
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,530
web now which is really nice say hey is

908
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,610
there a good fit and it is a needle in a

909
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:10,370
haystack but it's worth doing the

910
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:10,370
homework yeah I think there was another

911
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:35,848
sure yeah I mean so I what I was saying

912
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,310
is you know honesty is is an important

913
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:42,089
thing and like someone who is willing to

914
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:43,320
tell you their failures and is just as

915
00:36:42,089 --> 00:36:44,549
interesting as them telling you about

916
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,869
their success is probably more so

917
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:50,280
because you learn things from failures

918
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:51,720
that you don't from successes it's a

919
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,920
laundry list for me in terms of the

920
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,980
number of things that I've screwed up

921
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,480
over the years then it's a very small

922
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,980
list of things that I've done well and

923
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,480
the smallest is what goes in your resume

924
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:03,650
the laundry list of stuff is stuff that

925
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,589
you take personal experience from so

926
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:09,990
yeah it would be a very long long list

927
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:13,049
indeed and I'd say what I'd say you sort

928
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:15,720
of start to humbly recognize is is they

929
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:17,910
you know in our chair now as investors

930
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,290
or as operating people you really don't

931
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,660
know what you don't know you don't

932
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:23,520
honestly know what how things are gonna

933
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:26,040
play out and the best you can do is

934
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,509
stack the deck in your favor and be on

935
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:31,560
the right side of a trend it's not be

936
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:34,560
too early not be too late and and then

937
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,328
kind of be persistent in terms of the

938
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,680
direction that you want to keep pushing

939
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:40,020
the company and bit nimble enough to

940
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,339
read the tea leaves and surrounded by

941
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:44,190
smart people who will give you unbiased

942
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:45,750
advice who you listen to but not really

943
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:47,670
listened to because this is your vision

944
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:50,339
in your company and so that's the that's

945
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:52,680
the balancing act and then you know and

946
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:55,650
then the rest will be up to you know

947
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,970
luck and fate honestly but I would say

948
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:59,520
the thing that you can't get away with

949
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:02,910
is you can't lack vision you can't you

950
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:05,310
know lack persistence and you know going

951
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:06,750
in a direction that that is with the

952
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,950
prevailing winds in terms of the trends

953
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,560
that are happening at that point in time

954
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:13,470
with our consumer technology I'll give

955
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,869
you a few examples I mean a couple of my

956
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:18,180
Wall of shame and again it's a long list

957
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:21,960
but two that come to mind that might be

958
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:24,868
illustrative I possum Twilio because I

959
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,950
felt and that building and network from

960
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:28,440
the beginning

961
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:30,990
I should say was really hard and that

962
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:34,049
most of the platter from start as a nap

963
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:36,990
and then migrate plataforms and I I was

964
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:39,150
really concerned that you building a

965
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:41,098
platform was was was not gonna work

966
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:43,109
which I was obviously wrong they be

967
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:45,180
incredibly successful equally painful is

968
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:49,259
I built a company just like Twilio in

969
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:52,020
1998 with the guy that he knows and we

970
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:55,500
were absolutely right we were just 10

971
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:56,970
years too early and in you know it's no

972
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,799
more satisfying knowing that we were

973
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:00,180
right and we even burned through a lot

974
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:03,869
of our own money and our investors money

975
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,950
and you know nevertheless like you

976
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:06,359
learned a lot and those are those are

977
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:08,430
the ones you do learn to come from but

978
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:10,410
we made no more money by being right and

979
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:12,180
with the wrong time than if we yeah that

980
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:15,089
means it's okay and since I'm here

981
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:17,430
embarrassing myself I pass and Fitbit

982
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:18,990
because when I met with the founders

983
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:20,520
they said you know these what a

984
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:22,109
pedometer is like I didn't know it's

985
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,569
like okay pedometer you put in here

986
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:26,040
track your step they're all crappy but

987
00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:28,558
it's huge business and we're gonna build

988
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,880
a better pedometer that was a bitch and

989
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:31,950
I'm like you're gonna make a lot of

990
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,680
money but I don't want to be in the

991
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:36,509
pedometer business by the way so but the

992
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:40,140
fascinating thing is there was none of

993
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:43,349
these smart words vision trackers that

994
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:47,819
all came later but of course 20/20

995
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:48,809
hindsight big one that I back where I

996
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:51,270
lost all my money

997
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:53,190
interesting enough with evite now you

998
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:55,079
might wonder but wait a minute I you see

999
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:59,040
like but Eva was fascinating because

1000
00:39:55,079 --> 00:40:00,690
evite race a way too much money got

1001
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,390
ahead of itself and then during the

1002
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:05,520
bubble burst sold the company the guys

1003
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:07,740
have put the money in the series B and C

1004
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,799
got their money back those of us who had

1005
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:12,180
done the seed an a we got wiped out so

1006
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:14,579
sometimes the company is successful

1007
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,558
product and you still lose your money as

1008
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,299
investors most of us I don't think we

1009
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:20,130
worry too much about our misses we don't

1010
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:23,190
worry too much about the ones that we

1011
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:25,410
invested and when bad we care about the

1012
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:28,349
ones who invested and did well if we

1013
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:30,899
have enough of those the rest sort of

1014
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:32,460
like takes care of itself and again back

1015
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,339
to the relationship side of things if

1016
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:37,109
you meet you know for my past lives as

1017
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:38,849
an entrepreneur I mean a great investor

1018
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:39,900
who's gonna you know be your partner

1019
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:42,420
along this person

1020
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,460
if it doesn't work out they will be

1021
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,410
right there by your side for the second

1022
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,299
one if you did everything else that I

1023
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,799
mentioned earlier in terms of actually

1024
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:52,200
being a great communicator showing them

1025
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:53,670
you were trying your best and being

1026
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,649
honest with them and listening to them

1027
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:57,240
and actually taking the feedback not to

1028
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:58,829
the degree they literally just my most

1029
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,180
recent investment he's from intrapreneur

1030
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:01,470
whose previous company I was in both

1031
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,970
with it was kind of like a sideways

1032
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:05,609
exeed within those money with him

1033
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:10,980
mcmoney was huh but I like the guy so

1034
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:13,558
yeah good so reputation matters your

1035
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:15,990
experience and was there a question on

1036
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:29,039
this side or I think there was one over

1037
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:32,430
here some on the other side yes so I am

1038
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:34,920
a unusual profile if you will so I'm a

1039
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:38,308
full-time angel investor usually what I

1040
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:41,249
do is any given year I'll invest four on

1041
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:43,559
through three to five companies all

1042
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:46,680
super early I've been doing this for

1043
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:48,900
twenty years so I've invested in over a

1044
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,730
hundred companies of those hundred but

1045
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,710
fifty have had some kind of exit good or

1046
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:55,529
bad and although they're fictive if they

1047
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:57,539
are active I'm really only involved with

1048
00:41:55,529 --> 00:42:00,029
the ones I've invested in in the past

1049
00:41:57,539 --> 00:42:03,059
few years so there's probably maybe a

1050
00:42:00,029 --> 00:42:04,619
dozen or 12 to 15 companies that I I'm

1051
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:06,539
pretty engaged with and then there's

1052
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:08,460
another twenty to thirty that mean

1053
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:10,559
companies like say thumbtack which has

1054
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,009
hundreds of employees you know I don't I

1055
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:17,220
don't I'm not too active with them but

1056
00:42:13,009 --> 00:42:19,079
and then boards I limit to four at the

1057
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:23,098
top some one three three boards right

1058
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:25,230
now and we Jasmine sure partners is more

1059
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:28,200
of a traditional series a you know

1060
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:30,539
venture capital group and so our whole

1061
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,180
portfolio will have probably about

1062
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:35,519
fifteen companies in it when we're done

1063
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,839
and we have about seven right now so and

1064
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,700
then there's four partners and each of

1065
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:41,670
us shares board seats so I'm on a couple

1066
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:43,348
of boards then a given point in time but

1067
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:45,480
the dynamics are a little bit different

1068
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:46,559
because Ariel is and it as an angel gets

1069
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,380
in super early

1070
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:51,269
whereas Series A investing we tend to

1071
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,619
get in when there's a team in a company

1072
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:53,669
and a little bit of a prototype of a

1073
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:56,130
product that it's

1074
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:59,089
you know spitting distance to to market

1075
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:02,009
and so you know Mars probably will

1076
00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:03,630
unlikely percolate around for you know

1077
00:43:02,009 --> 00:43:05,460
eight or ten years before they exit

1078
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:07,640
whereas that's very possible in his

1079
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,640
world

1080
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:30,419
what do you mean the blood in the

1081
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:39,890
streets in terms of wait until people

1082
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:45,210
are duking it out in the market yeah I

1083
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:47,960
hate that we look for places so what we

1084
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:50,640
do is like this wacky intersection of

1085
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,950
you know applied neuroscience and human

1086
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,200
performance technology you know so our

1087
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:57,089
slogan is the brain is the next program

1088
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,979
over the platform right there are no

1089
00:43:57,089 --> 00:44:00,660
other venture capital groups that say

1090
00:43:58,979 --> 00:44:02,538
that or anything close to it so we're

1091
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:06,569
sort of outstanding in our own field

1092
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:08,549
whether that's smart or or crazy you

1093
00:44:06,569 --> 00:44:12,359
know we'll talk in ten years and let you

1094
00:44:08,549 --> 00:44:14,670
know so we don't like the you know Duke

1095
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:16,890
it out let let you know but the lowest

1096
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:19,349
common denominator win that's definitely

1097
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:21,839
a way that certain investors get good

1098
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:23,369
valuations and companies but ultimately

1099
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,660
that you're inherently playing in a

1100
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:28,380
crowded market right then - and I don't

1101
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:31,348
think that's very fun I mean I think

1102
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,849
most of the investors at least the ones

1103
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:35,549
that I tend to work the most in Silicon

1104
00:44:32,849 --> 00:44:38,249
Valley are not as sensitive to the

1105
00:44:35,549 --> 00:44:40,739
pricing and the terms it's we want to be

1106
00:44:38,249 --> 00:44:43,319
involved with great projects with great

1107
00:44:40,739 --> 00:44:44,969
teams with great deals and if I went in

1108
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:46,979
at a five mil evolution a three million

1109
00:44:44,969 --> 00:44:49,589
dollar 20 mil evolution if it becomes a

1110
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:51,058
billion dollar company who cares if I

1111
00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:53,519
work with a great team and I had a great

1112
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:54,989
time and I build my network but so those

1113
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:56,939
are the kind of things that I that I

1114
00:44:54,989 --> 00:45:01,229
think the smartest investors are looking

1115
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:04,079
for much less let me try to find who I

1116
00:45:01,229 --> 00:45:06,598
take advantage of but there are that

1117
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,369
category does exist yeah but but it's

1118
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:09,180
not the people you want to really be in

1119
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:10,559
business with

1120
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,359
I think the valuation things a little

1121
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:13,739
double-edged sword there too is like

1122
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:15,598
there's a lot of entrepreneurs that have

1123
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:19,170
unrealistic expectations for what their

1124
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,819
company's worth and and you know the

1125
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:22,499
market will tell you what your company's

1126
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:24,630
worth and so don't think it's worth 20

1127
00:45:22,499 --> 00:45:26,038
million bucks if you don't have revenue

1128
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:28,410
and you don't have a product in market

1129
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:29,999
you know customers ending in despite the

1130
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:31,348
fact that you know because there's a

1131
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:32,939
bias towards what gets covered in the

1132
00:45:31,349 --> 00:45:35,279
media and it's covered the media is a

1133
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,839
Twitter just went public and you know

1134
00:45:35,279 --> 00:45:37,680
all of the the receptionist is now a

1135
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:39,630
multimillionaire

1136
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,269
and the reality is that's

1137
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:43,920
one in 10,000 companies where something

1138
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:46,890
interesting like that happens to that

1139
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,529
scale when I see a really high valuation

1140
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:50,640
what worries me more is less evaluation

1141
00:45:49,529 --> 00:45:52,200
that what does that say about the

1142
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,940
founders is a family that's being greedy

1143
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,890
as a founder that's being unreasonable

1144
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,259
is the parent take advantage of somebody

1145
00:45:55,890 --> 00:46:00,839
else and if those things check out and

1146
00:45:58,259 --> 00:46:01,589
it's like a reasonable reason then maybe

1147
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:03,720
I still do it

1148
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:04,589
sure and then the other thing that you

1149
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,779
guys need to worry about as

1150
00:46:04,589 --> 00:46:08,578
entrepreneurs is in the world of

1151
00:46:06,779 --> 00:46:11,549
financing your company usually what

1152
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:14,849
happens was whenever you take a round of

1153
00:46:11,549 --> 00:46:17,910
capital I call it Series A at a certain

1154
00:46:14,849 --> 00:46:19,680
valuation if that is not going to get

1155
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:21,720
you all the way through to the promised

1156
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,890
land which it rarely does you know now

1157
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,140
you're on the treadmill and so you're

1158
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:26,759
gonna take a series B your investors

1159
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,920
need to show that you've created enough

1160
00:46:26,759 --> 00:46:30,930
value that your Series B is priced that

1161
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,809
higher significantly higher than your

1162
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:35,879
Series A so that you know the next round

1163
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:37,829
of investors are sort of marking up our

1164
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,630
investment and so starting off with a

1165
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:41,940
really high valuation makes it that much

1166
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:44,309
more challenging to get the next round

1167
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,979
of investors involved at the right price

1168
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:48,210
- and so then you go into this horrible

1169
00:46:45,979 --> 00:46:53,640
downward spiral which we've seen happen

1170
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:55,710
a lot of times - yeah good thanks so

1171
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,359
just back again here just to the point

1172
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:59,160
you guys wring your you're a typical for

1173
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:02,130
local investors so local investors often

1174
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:04,049
do look for to drive valuations down and

1175
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,269
they want the profitable things and so

1176
00:47:04,049 --> 00:47:13,200
to her point I've seen it's because they

1177
00:47:06,269 --> 00:47:14,758
invest in real estate and so it can be a

1178
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,529
very different animal for an

1179
00:47:14,759 --> 00:47:18,210
entrepreneur to deal with I think that

1180
00:47:16,529 --> 00:47:19,680
dealing with I've had experience now

1181
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,390
dealing with Silicon Valley investors

1182
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,618
and that characteristic one of the

1183
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:24,660
things for a successful entrepreneurs

1184
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:26,880
here is that it's it's a pleasure

1185
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:29,460
because you you're not getting a phone

1186
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,410
call every second or third day and and

1187
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:34,349
if you're taking entrepreneurial money

1188
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:35,670
in a local community it can be extremely

1189
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:37,710
dangerous because you can be dealing

1190
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:40,079
with panicked phone calls regularly as

1191
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:42,619
as a diss massive distraction to your

1192
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:45,180
business and you guys are extremely

1193
00:47:42,619 --> 00:47:47,339
experienced you've seen lots of wins and

1194
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:49,259
losses and so it's just a think it's a

1195
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:50,339
completely different animal as an

1196
00:47:49,259 --> 00:47:51,599
entrepreneur that you're dealing with I

1197
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:53,400
think you've probably both experienced

1198
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,009
it as well yeah absolutely sir

1199
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,930
on that front it's you know you need

1200
00:47:56,009 --> 00:48:00,329
money to keep the lights on to build

1201
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:04,589
your vision of a business so you know

1202
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:05,910
capital is required but it is it like I

1203
00:48:04,589 --> 00:48:07,499
said it's a double-edged sword so be

1204
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:09,690
very very very careful we take before

1205
00:48:07,499 --> 00:48:11,848
you take any money's money family

1206
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:13,440
friends and family money is like

1207
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:15,299
sometimes it's the easiest to find

1208
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,829
where's your mom once they write you a

1209
00:48:15,299 --> 00:48:18,719
check but on the flip side it's like the

1210
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:20,759
most painful to actually go back to mom

1211
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:22,109
and tell her you just blew the second

1212
00:48:20,759 --> 00:48:25,079
mortgage on our house and it didn't work

1213
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:26,339
out and so every one of these you have

1214
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:28,589
to think through the repercussions of

1215
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:30,239
what happens whenever this doesn't work

1216
00:48:28,589 --> 00:48:31,650
just as much as you want to think

1217
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:33,269
through the repercussions it's very easy

1218
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:34,650
there are no repercussions whenever you

1219
00:48:33,269 --> 00:48:36,029
tell them that worked out hooray we all

1220
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,739
just made a lot of money that's easy to

1221
00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:39,779
deal with it's the other side of the

1222
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:41,219
coin whenever it doesn't go well it's

1223
00:48:39,779 --> 00:48:43,170
really hard and so you know to your

1224
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:45,059
point is is this professional investor

1225
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:47,400
you have to go through the accredited do

1226
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:48,509
they know the idea of binary loss of

1227
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,430
their money do they know that they're on

1228
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:52,710
a tenure horizon where they have no I

1229
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:54,239
know influence over what happens and if

1230
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:55,710
all of those things check out and

1231
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:57,569
they've done a lot of other things in

1232
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:58,920
your space before it great fantastic but

1233
00:48:57,569 --> 00:49:00,839
otherwise yeah it's buyer beware they're

1234
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,749
like you do get some value from

1235
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:05,788
professional investors in terms of the

1236
00:49:02,749 --> 00:49:08,089
poller ins for risk and you usually

1237
00:49:05,789 --> 00:49:12,049
still get advice too hopefully yeah

1238
00:49:08,089 --> 00:49:12,049
there was a question in the bank

1239
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:21,280
sure didn't hate a question current well

1240
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,750
do you think your tell me of this

1241
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,350
correct do you think your investments

1242
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:31,630
will be affected by current politics

1243
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:35,319
correct fascinating I mean I think you

1244
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:38,410
have to say yes on the flip side is I

1245
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:39,570
try to focus on projects that are as

1246
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:42,700
[Music]

1247
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:46,240
self-contained and as independent from

1248
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:50,410
the short-term durations of the world if

1249
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:52,120
you will as possible so like I'm not

1250
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:55,270
looking at any of my companies now and

1251
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:57,160
being concerned the probably the biggest

1252
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:59,170
challenge might be if somebody's

1253
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,740
fundraising then and the whole financial

1254
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:05,800
market starts to get in turmoil that

1255
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:09,609
obviously can get in the way but you

1256
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:10,360
know yeah we're we're sort of two minds

1257
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:13,150
about this one

1258
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:14,920
one is something's gonna change we just

1259
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:17,620
don't know what and so we can't really

1260
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,030
obsess about it too much so stick to

1261
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:21,220
your fundamentals of like building

1262
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:22,540
companies that ultimately have you know

1263
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:24,250
great teams that are making great

1264
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:27,640
products that solve real problems of

1265
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:30,010
some sort and build real value there but

1266
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,629
then what are the externalities that

1267
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:33,490
could meaningfully impact your business

1268
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:35,110
yes if you're really relying on a

1269
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:37,810
foreign market and some tariffs they're

1270
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:39,790
gonna get slapped down there you know we

1271
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:42,910
have to observe that and see what

1272
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:44,980
happens and so in those cases maybe we

1273
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:46,540
advise the company to hang on to your

1274
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:49,150
cash a little bit longer until we know

1275
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:50,590
what the landscape looks like you know

1276
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:51,880
and in our case do we keep a little bit

1277
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:54,700
more money in reserve so the way

1278
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:57,220
investing typically works is you know we

1279
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:59,649
put in an early amount call a tax and

1280
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,779
then we keep one or two x in reserve to

1281
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:03,730
help back their company through all the

1282
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:07,690
ups and downs of subsequent financings

1283
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:09,880
so you know so we think about it really

1284
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:11,740
it's kind of brahma per company basis a

1285
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:13,390
lot of what we do has FDA risk

1286
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:16,000
associated with it or at least some of

1287
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:17,890
what we do and the FDA might change its

1288
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,290
to whether that works in our favor

1289
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:22,839
against us you know it's out of our

1290
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:24,130
control so we'll sort of you know keep a

1291
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,020
close eye on things and see where it

1292
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:31,250
goes

1293
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:35,030
any any other questions I mean just

1294
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:37,280
throw it one more any just a quick one

1295
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:39,250
here I think maybe in Austin like other

1296
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,230
regional tech centers or a lot of

1297
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:44,210
accelerators incubators things of that

1298
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:47,210
nature but you know they don't come for

1299
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:51,320
free you give up some equity but you get

1300
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:54,470
some other resources thoughts on the

1301
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:56,570
value of those or kind of somebody going

1302
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:59,200
through that process and then coming to

1303
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:03,110
see you do you guys watch Silicon Valley

1304
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:05,560
anywhere ever seen it it's painful

1305
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:09,590
because it's sort of close to accurate

1306
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:11,870
so some it's the answer is your mileage

1307
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:14,060
may vary right it's some incubators give

1308
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:16,430
you a lot and and they give you a

1309
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:18,350
network and a little bit of cash and

1310
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:19,910
really help you get your product going

1311
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:22,160
and then other ones you know you're

1312
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:24,170
renting a room for 6% of your company

1313
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,509
and you get nothing out of it and so I

1314
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:28,850
just say again they serve an incredible

1315
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:32,090
purpose and a lot of them are fantastic

1316
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:33,589
and we're involved with a few but it's

1317
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:35,900
just you know do your homework there too

1318
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:36,920
right don't don't just give someone 10%

1319
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,910
of your company because they're gonna

1320
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,550
give you a place to stay

1321
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:46,160
the very best accelerator slash

1322
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:48,740
incubators are terrific and the majority

1323
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:51,379
are not but then the flip side is that

1324
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:53,509
if as a company you could really use a

1325
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,640
lot of help then even some of the

1326
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:58,340
circulars that might not be as value

1327
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,960
might still be worthwhile and the last

1328
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:02,330
thing I would say is don't obsess over

1329
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,680
giving away five percent or 10 even ten

1330
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:05,630
percent of your company if it's gonna

1331
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,750
make a difference because most companies

1332
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:12,350
fail and lose a hundred percent and

1333
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:13,790
never get anywhere so which is it was a

1334
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:15,950
founder you have to do what's the bigger

1335
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:18,590
risk that I fail entirely or that I

1336
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:22,960
succeed but I lose ten percent right so

1337
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:28,690
keep always that long term that's good

1338
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:28,690
any other question last question

1339
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:42,890
yeah

1340
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:51,960
well it depends on what you mean ready

1341
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:54,890
for primetime I mean I think that a lot

1342
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:57,930
of what we're discussing here is not

1343
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:59,430
necessarily ready to start selling lots

1344
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:01,830
of units and lots of dollars tomorrow

1345
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:05,040
but I would say a lot of what we're

1346
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:08,970
talking here has a trajectory or a

1347
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:12,480
roadmap to build something good so I'm

1348
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:14,549
definitely very I think if you have that

1349
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,410
realistic vision of here's how long it's

1350
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:18,900
gonna take if I will get there we start

1351
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:21,690
small and we build up to it that's

1352
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:24,510
totally fine on the other hand if you

1353
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:26,820
have unrealistic goals that say oh we're

1354
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:29,310
gonna sell some crazy month next year or

1355
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:31,620
the flip side if you just have no idea

1356
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:34,170
you're like yeah I don't really know

1357
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:36,210
this is cool bleeding edge and I don't

1358
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:37,860
know how it's gonna be a business that's

1359
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:39,510
a tough one but if you say yeah it's

1360
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:41,550
gonna take time but eventually we get

1361
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:43,500
there that's totally fine I mean that's

1362
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:44,940
the kind of stuff we love which is so we

1363
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:47,880
want to think there is we want to be in

1364
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,900
the journey as long as that angle I mean

1365
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,670
there's a reason that there's guys like

1366
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,900
us here we're not here just to be

1367
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:54,090
speakers we're here because it's really

1368
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:56,280
cool right and this is interesting and

1369
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:57,630
and I don't have enough time to just do

1370
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,640
things that are cool like this is cool

1371
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:02,100
with there they're gonna be investments

1372
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,950
that pop out of this base for sure and

1373
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:07,830
so then then it's really the right

1374
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:10,980
combination of you know again kind of

1375
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:12,569
like technology market opportunity right

1376
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:16,110
people going after it with a reasonable

1377
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:17,490
time horizon you know like you said guys

1378
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:19,620
like us can't make investments that are

1379
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:21,720
10 years out but we don't expect that

1380
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:23,339
there's going to be a profitable you

1381
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:26,069
know return or you're gonna be making

1382
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:27,690
lots of money tomorrow and so you know

1383
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:30,000
what's that right window it just depends

1384
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:31,140
on again what what's the upside and how

1385
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,090
long it's gonna take to get there

1386
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:34,350
but there's a lot of stuff so well I

1387
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:35,640
don't know if you guys walked around the

1388
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:38,610
expo floor but there's like a lot of

1389
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,799
stuff there it's you know inches away

1390
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:42,240
from being real products with real

1391
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,980
market opportunities and yes

1392
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,649
everything's a little bit rough around

1393
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:48,480
the edges but that's okay it's you know

1394
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:49,829
you're not quite ready for consumer

1395
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,630
electronics show yet but

1396
00:55:49,829 --> 00:55:52,859
yes is boring on some levels like you

1397
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:54,269
have you know bigger and bigger

1398
00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:55,558
flat-screen TVs and you have to be a

1399
00:55:54,269 --> 00:55:58,229
multi-billion dollar company to make

1400
00:55:55,559 --> 00:56:00,359
those whereas if you make you know NFC

1401
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:02,640
activated glow-in-the-dark nails using

1402
00:56:00,359 --> 00:56:04,380
an LED like you're the only one doing

1403
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,390
that right now and that's really cool

1404
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:08,459
and then the question is can you make a

1405
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:11,098
business out of that or not you know to

1406
00:56:08,459 --> 00:56:12,509
be determined but that stuff is really

1407
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:13,019
cool like there's a lot of it out there

1408
00:56:12,509 --> 00:56:14,729
too

1409
00:56:13,019 --> 00:56:15,930
I was impressed with how many things and

1410
00:56:14,729 --> 00:56:18,299
there's one there's one venture-backed

1411
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:20,969
company that I saw in there that's David

1412
00:56:18,299 --> 00:56:24,979
Eagleman Xanthi because yeah are you

1413
00:56:20,969 --> 00:56:26,999
involved in that not formally okay

1414
00:56:24,979 --> 00:56:28,410
but that's interesting and it is

1415
00:56:26,999 --> 00:56:30,538
basically it's like a replacement for

1416
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:32,519
cochlear implants where it's sort of

1417
00:56:30,539 --> 00:56:34,440
applied neuroscience where you hear

1418
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:36,660
something and it sort of moves it -

1419
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:39,239
instead of your eardrums vibrating it's

1420
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:41,190
a bunch of vibrating motors on surface

1421
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:43,440
your body but then your brain learns how

1422
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:45,839
to reinterpret a sound really cool is

1423
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,789
there a market for that today you know

1424
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:49,049
but but there's a big enough market if

1425
00:56:47,789 --> 00:56:51,059
deaf people don't want to get cochlear

1426
00:56:49,049 --> 00:56:52,829
implants that that would be helpful - so

1427
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:55,170
that was a venture back the company that

1428
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:58,049
you know raised a lot of money great

1429
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:58,529
well we've come up to an hour that went

1430
00:56:58,049 --> 00:57:01,799
fast

1431
00:56:58,529 --> 00:57:04,469
well great conversation so maybe a

1432
00:57:01,799 --> 00:57:06,109
parting comment or a thought Ariel for

1433
00:57:04,469 --> 00:57:08,130
the group

1434
00:57:06,109 --> 00:57:09,749
thank you for motor any thank you for

1435
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:11,160
the questions it's great to have all the

1436
00:57:09,749 --> 00:57:13,279
questions otherwise you feel terrible

1437
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:17,969
here so thank you to her buddy

1438
00:57:13,279 --> 00:57:19,650
one last comment would be coming again

1439
00:57:17,969 --> 00:57:21,749
from this Silicon Valley but in general

1440
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:24,150
people like us I think we tend to be

1441
00:57:21,749 --> 00:57:26,279
super happy to help and try to be

1442
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:28,979
helpful to entrepreneurs of all stages

1443
00:57:26,279 --> 00:57:30,900
so my part in coming will be you gotta

1444
00:57:28,979 --> 00:57:33,239
help us help you and that what that

1445
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:35,670
means is that for example I might get

1446
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:38,249
someone that says hey can you think of a

1447
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:40,769
good investor for me and then they

1448
00:57:38,249 --> 00:57:43,140
putting all the work on my plate and I

1449
00:57:40,769 --> 00:57:45,058
might not probably I know but if on the

1450
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:47,308
other hand the person says hey I did

1451
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:49,559
some homework and this particular person

1452
00:57:47,309 --> 00:57:51,299
looks like a good investor and I noticed

1453
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:52,859
that you're connected with her and this

1454
00:57:51,299 --> 00:57:54,719
or that way and here's the email you can

1455
00:57:52,859 --> 00:57:56,729
forward and then it takes me 20 seconds

1456
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:59,190
to make the connection in boom a lot of

1457
00:57:56,729 --> 00:58:02,359
value gets create out so try to use

1458
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:05,140
people like us but just help us help

1459
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:07,490
yeah I think that's great advice um and

1460
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:09,799
yeah I mean again I kind of reiterating

1461
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:11,060
it's you guys are sort of on the

1462
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:14,870
forefront of something that's really

1463
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:17,360
cool and interesting so my advice is is

1464
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:19,790
that you know be patient but but don't

1465
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:21,380
be shy about what you're doing it's sort

1466
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:22,970
of right now is the time to go for it

1467
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:25,790
when you see a big wide open for there's

1468
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:28,040
so few clean open greenfield

1469
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:30,560
opportunities out there that whenever

1470
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:32,180
you you know again you you guys have

1471
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:34,490
found it you've gravitated towards here

1472
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:36,290
towards this conference so now it's

1473
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:38,270
really in that crazy

1474
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:40,940
you know frontier you actually have to

1475
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:42,770
find real watering holes that are actual

1476
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:44,630
places where you can make businesses as

1477
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:46,190
opposed to getting lost in the

1478
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:48,530
wilderness but when you find them don't

1479
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:50,540
be shy go for it because again you're

1480
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:52,430
you you know we're where we live you

1481
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:54,470
know there are very very very few

1482
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:55,640
unexplored territories to be had and now

1483
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:58,609
people are doing incremental

1484
00:58:55,640 --> 00:59:01,450
improvements on you know data based

1485
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:03,560
reporting and or you know cloud API

1486
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:05,569
optimization and things that are less

1487
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,970
interesting than finding a completely

1488
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:09,200
new virgin territory to go for so you

1489
