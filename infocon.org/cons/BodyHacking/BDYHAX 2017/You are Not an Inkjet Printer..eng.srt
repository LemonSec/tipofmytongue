1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,830
hi folks nice to see you all thank you

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,410
for coming you know there is a formality

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,150
before I start here as a member in good

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,380
standing of the after-dinner and

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,349
conference speakers of England Scotland

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,240
and Wales I have a requirement here as

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,920
the first speaker of the day to make a

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,409
joke about you all having been drunk in

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:34,260
Hanover this morning this is that joke

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:36,870
thank you so in last March March 2016

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,309
HPE pushed out on an update to its

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,800
Officejet novice jet boat

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,870
Joe Officejet Pro printers in the field

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,839
several tens of millions of these

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,419
printers and the users of these printers

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,219
were alerted via a note on their screen

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,510
on the little LCD on the printer telling

18
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,559
them that there was a security update

19
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,820
and tap the screen to run the update HP

20
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,399
officials claimed that they get about

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,969
two-thirds compliance on this kind of

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,849
update but my internal sources tell me

23
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,350
that it's probably more like 98 percent

24
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:09,360
so that update was not in fact a

25
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,490
security update what it was was a

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,070
firmware update that activated a silent

27
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,570
counter that counted down until

28
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:22,289
September 6 months later and on the day

29
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,839
that it detonated all of the affected HP

30
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,370
printers activated a hidden feature that

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,650
allowed them to distinguish between

32
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,290
third party ink and first party ink and

33
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,180
to reject all third party cartridges so

34
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,860
nobody was really sure what was going on

35
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,230
when this happened just people all over

36
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,880
the world woke up and discovered that

37
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,980
their printer didn't want to use the

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,600
cartridge they had and people swapped in

39
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,120
known-good cartridges that they bought

40
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,259
in bulk at Costco in the sales and when

41
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,960
the printer refused all of them they

42
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,090
just threw them away but the message for

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,949
traffic built up and up and complaints

44
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,350
flooded into third party ink vendors and

45
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,290
eventually the picture began to come

46
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:01,679
clear that HP had deliberately broken

47
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:04,650
millions of its customers property and

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,270
as a way of punishing them for failing

49
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,700
to arrange their affairs in a way that

50
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,978
was most beneficial to HP's shareholders

51
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:14,069
instead of to their own use of this

52
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,680
product now you may think this is just a

53
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:19,589
garden-variety ripoff but it has very

54
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,190
deep implications thanks to a late 20th

55
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,650
century copyright law

56
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,820
that has found an extraordinarily

57
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,250
hospitable environment in today's 21st

58
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,870
century environment and that's the

59
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,540
Digital Millennium Copyright Act or DMCA

60
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,580
Congress passed this law in 1998 and

61
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,489
it's a kind of gnarly hairball of

62
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,570
copyright with many provisions but the

63
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:41,500
one that I'm going to talk about today

64
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:44,410
is section 1201 of the DMCA under DMC

65
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,810
1201 tampering with access controls for

66
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:49,329
copyrighted works can incur both civil

67
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,790
and criminal liability and not just a

68
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,230
little for example in the criminal side

69
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,060
it's a five hundred thousand dollar fine

70
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,510
in a five-year prison sentence for a

71
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,250
first offense and when 1201 passed this

72
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,320
was mostly about protecting the business

73
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,890
models of people who made consoles and

74
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,320
DVD players DVD vendors could add a

75
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,600
region code to their discs and then they

76
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,400
could use license agreements to ensure

77
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,930
that all the DVD players that could

78
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,120
decrypt those discs would check for that

79
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,150
region code and reject out of region

80
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,830
discs so buying a disc in country a and

81
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,170
playing it in country B that is not

82
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,750
piracy right that is actually the

83
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,769
opposite of piracy right paying the

84
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:32,950
asked for price for a copyrighted work

85
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:34,450
from the copyright owner and then taking

86
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,600
that disc and putting it in your DVD

87
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:41,829
player that is what we want people to do

88
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,170
under copyright law it's indescribably

89
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:48,220
weird that an anti-piracy law banned

90
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:51,760
this act and for companies like Sega and

91
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:54,400
the other nascent console markets DMC

92
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,709
1201 protected a Dreamcast business

93
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,440
model which was a lot like the iOS App

94
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:02,950
Store companies that wanted to sell Sega

95
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,140
games had to buy special CD mastering

96
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,149
services from Sega Sega charged a very

97
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,089
high premium for that so there was a

98
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,100
commission on every disc pressed that

99
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,230
went to Sega before you went and bought

100
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,489
it and that Commission was in the price

101
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,260
of the disc so there was a little

102
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:20,769
premium on every game that you bought

103
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:23,140
now it meant that Sega could decide who

104
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:25,330
could make the software that ran on the

105
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,270
computers that it sold to you now once

106
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:30,460
again like making a copyrighted game is

107
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,990
not an act of piracy and buying that

108
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,979
copyrighted game and playing it on your

109
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:37,320
own computer is not an act of piracy but

110
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,110
by adding a layer of copyright

111
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,120
protection to the disk such that you

112
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,360
could only play the disk if it came from

113
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,190
Sega Sega could make buying a disc from

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,770
a software company that sold it to you

115
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,510
that had made that game into an act of

116
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,890
piracy punishable by five year prison

117
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:56,539
sentence and a five hundred thousand

118
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:59,990
dollar fine so every business has

119
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:02,490
commercial preferences and legal rights

120
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,040
Sega has the legal right to prevent

121
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,380
people from cloning Sega consoles and

122
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,660
and marketing those game and marketing

123
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,880
those game consoles without without

124
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,770
paying them a license for the copyrights

125
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,630
and patents and their devices but it

126
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,250
also has this commercial preference that

127
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,920
it wants to be the gatekeeper and toll

128
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,330
collector for every game that is sold to

129
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,400
run on one of these computers that it's

130
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,140
selling you for your living room and by

131
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,150
designing its consoles that you had to

132
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,330
break DRM in order to play on official

133
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,849
games Sega could convert that commercial

134
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,380
preference into a legal right now that

135
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:38,160
is a license to print money

136
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:40,680
what CEO has not dreamed of a world in

137
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,080
which Congress would enact a law were

138
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,350
acting in a way that frustrated the CEOs

139
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:49,770
wishes was a literal federal crime in

140
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,990
felony and companies began to poke at

141
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,240
the DMCA to see if they couldn't avail

142
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,640
themselves of this provision to convert

143
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,150
their own commercial preferences into

144
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,460
legal rights now one of them was Skylink

145
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:08,190
skylynx a company that makes garage door

146
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:09,900
openers and they they had a commercial

147
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,060
preference which was that everyone

148
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,789
should be forced to buy their spare

149
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,530
garage door clickers from Skylink and

150
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,780
Skylink churched a high premium on them

151
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,179
and so they designed their openers to

152
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,400
only work with their original clickers

153
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,470
which they charge a lot of money for now

154
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,060
what normally happens in market

155
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,070
economies is if you've got a product

156
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,330
that you make a very high margin on and

157
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,440
someone can figure out how to make that

158
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,180
product for cheaper

159
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,800
they'll manufacture that product charge

160
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,420
less and it will competition will drive

161
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,980
prices down and then you have to

162
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,170
innovate and invent something else in

163
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,880
order to to continue to command a high

164
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:45,180
margin that's that's you know kind of

165
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,550
the whole basis for a market economy but

166
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,990
Skylink said all right we're gonna we're

167
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,640
gonna freeze our competitor

168
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,370
out and so when competitors of their

169
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,409
started to make their own third-party

170
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:58,860
clickers that cost a lot less than

171
00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:01,170
skylynx clickers Skylink actually sued

172
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,200
them under section 12 one of the DMCA

173
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:06,900
they argued that this competition was

174
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,000
illegal because they were having to

175
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,739
change the software in the Skylink

176
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,680
device and that this was a circa mention

177
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,600
of a technical protection measure on a

178
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,850
copyrighted work but the court didn't

179
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,700
buy it the Federal Circuit said well you

180
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:23,330
know the DMCA protects access controls

181
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:26,340
to copyrighted works and we can't find

182
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,169
anything that is software that is

183
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,260
copyrightable in your garage door owner

184
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:33,150
except for the DRM and so what you're

185
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,219
saying is like the DRM is protecting the

186
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:38,340
DRM and that's to Circular even for us

187
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,920
and so they threw them out but then not

188
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,080
this company Lexmark took a swing so

189
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,430
Lexmark had the traditional printer

190
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,060
business model very high price for

191
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:50,010
consumables subsidy price on the on the

192
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,380
initial hardware they were at the time

193
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:54,210
IBM's printer division and they had

194
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,330
these laser toner cartridges that had a

195
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:59,310
chip and the chip had a 12 by tram in it

196
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,620
and what that program did is when the

197
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:04,380
toner cartridge was empty the program

198
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,900
ran and said any time you ask me I will

199
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,350
tell you I am an empty cartridge and so

200
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,539
if you refill the cartridge the printer

201
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,280
would ask the chip are you an empty

202
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,830
cartridge and the cartridge would say

203
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,570
why yes I am and the printer would

204
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,640
refuse to use it and a company called

205
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:22,020
static controls which was a competitor

206
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,820
of Lexmark's at the time although now

207
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,039
they're Lexmark's owner and a weird

208
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,230
turnout for the books a company called

209
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,240
static controls they clone the chip they

210
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,010
defeated this 12 by program because it's

211
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,780
a 12 by program it's not hard to defeat

212
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:39,240
right and they made a refiller for these

213
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:42,959
toner cartridges and Lexmark sued them

214
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,070
and they said we don't just have DRM

215
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,290
that's copyrightable

216
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,240
we have a 12 by program that is

217
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,120
copyrightable and again the Federal

218
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,970
Circuit said you know software can be

219
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,710
copyrightable but like 12 bytes doesn't

220
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,810
rise to the standard of copyright

221
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:00,630
ability so again you don't have a

222
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,319
copyrighted work so that brings us back

223
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,889
to HP and what happened

224
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,630
last spring and this autumn back in 2003

225
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:10,690
even a company that was pulling down the

226
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,930
massive margins that Lexmark had did not

227
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,759
have extra capital to throw into real

228
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,709
microcontrollers in its consumables and

229
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:21,040
its toner cartridges but that is not

230
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:22,959
true any longer today cartridges like

231
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,849
the ones in HP printers they have

232
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,250
thousands of lines of code on them full

233
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,440
systems on a chip with operating systems

234
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:33,670
network stacks everything just in each

235
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,279
cartridge when HP turns its commercial

236
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,199
preference for you to spend more money

237
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:41,050
on ink than you would pay for a vintage

238
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:43,089
Veuve Cliquot into that legal right to

239
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,160
reach into your house and reconfigure

240
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:47,649
your property so that you must do this

241
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,660
we're getting into new and scary legal

242
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:51,370
territory that goes way past what

243
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,680
happened with Lexmark a decade and a

244
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:57,279
half ago it's not hard to figure out how

245
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,019
to defeat HP's DRM they have something

246
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,569
like an interactive protocol the printer

247
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:03,220
generates a random number it sends it to

248
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:04,569
the chip the chip has a signing key it

249
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,069
signs the random number it sends it back

250
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:08,790
to the printer that's how they validate

251
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:11,260
that there's a that there's the real

252
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,060
deal going on that it's a real original

253
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,470
chip now to defeat this you have to

254
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,930
figure out what their signing key is and

255
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,519
the signing key is in the chip and the

256
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,519
chip is in the cartridge and to get a

257
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:23,500
cartridge you just go to the store so if

258
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,420
you want to have a crack at like

259
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,269
figuring out how to extract that secret

260
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,829
from the chip all you need to do is just

261
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:31,029
go to any office supply store in the

262
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:33,040
world and give them between ten and

263
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:34,329
twenty five dollars and they will give

264
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,550
you one that you can take home and

265
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:39,130
subject to fuzzing and decapping and

266
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:41,229
electron tunneling microscopy and all of

267
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:44,139
the other techniques that people use to

268
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,699
extract secrets from hardware so DRM

269
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:48,130
systems they're built by skilled

270
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:50,500
engineers over a period of years at a

271
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:53,680
cost of millions and they're broken by

272
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,240
bored teenagers in a matter of days for

273
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,550
free and it's not because those

274
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,579
engineers are foolish it's because

275
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,250
they're on a fool's errand only idiots

276
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:05,529
hide signing keys and equipment that

277
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:08,380
they give to their adversaries for the

278
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:10,660
same reason that even really good bank

279
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,880
safes are kept in the bank's vault and

280
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,430
not in the bank robbers living room

281
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,209
because it doesn't matter how good your

282
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,609
secrecy

283
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:20,290
is if you hand your device to your

284
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:23,319
adversary to work on on their own

285
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:25,660
premises with their own equipment they

286
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:28,240
will always break it open so it's not

287
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:31,179
hard to break HP DRM but it is legally

288
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,519
terrifying investors retailers other

289
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:35,860
necessary parties in the value chain are

290
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,649
justifiably scared that fortune 100

291
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,089
companies with billions in cash and it's

292
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:43,269
bit and their business models on the

293
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:45,339
line will use the DMCA to punish them

294
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:50,619
for helping their customers avoid that

295
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:52,689
10 billion percent markup for ink so the

296
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:55,300
printer cartridges are no longer the

297
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:56,349
only devices that have software inside

298
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,149
of them in the world today

299
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:01,059
software as Marc Andreessen famously

300
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:02,800
reminded us is eating the world it's

301
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:04,600
hard to overstate the cheapness of

302
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,819
compute power and the software to run on

303
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,679
it even to an audience of people who are

304
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:11,679
contemplating putting computers in their

305
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:13,990
bodies one thing to think about here is

306
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:17,559
like SD cards write those little cheap

307
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:20,290
disposable SD cards SD cards use tons of

308
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:23,618
recycled RAM and that recycled Ram has

309
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:25,269
lots of defects in it and so the normal

310
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:27,399
way that we would handle that is by like

311
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:29,079
doing a lot of QA on every stick that

312
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:31,089
came off the line to find those sectors

313
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:34,118
and mark them off or see what was going

314
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:36,249
on it's actually so cheap to add compute

315
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:38,889
power now that every SD card has a full

316
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:41,499
on system on a chip with its own drive

317
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:43,689
and device driver that in real time is

318
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:45,910
doing bad sector detection and marking

319
00:12:43,689 --> 00:12:48,969
off right so that that like chip that

320
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:52,929
you buy in grow slots for you know $15

321
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:55,209
that gross of chips each one has a full

322
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:59,009
on system on a chip on it because that's

323
00:12:55,209 --> 00:13:02,049
how unbelievably cheap compute power is

324
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:04,720
embedded Linux has made the jump

325
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:06,309
it went from DVRs to home routers to

326
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,410
network attached storage is to Mountain

327
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:11,079
medical implants and now smart

328
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:13,600
lightbulbs and the weird thing is there

329
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:16,929
is no Internet of Things business model

330
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,759
Hardware starts at a 2% markup and then

331
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:20,740
plummets quickly as soon as your

332
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:23,110
hardware becomes successful and is

333
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,519
cloned somewhere in the far east and you

334
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,589
can actually end up a negative territory

335
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:28,870
in terms of your margin on your hardware

336
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:29,560
the only way to raise capital for

337
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,440
something

338
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,579
has a 2% or less margin is to promise

339
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,500
your investors that you're gonna make

340
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:38,050
money somewhere else not on the hardware

341
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,029
itself and usually that means making

342
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,250
money on the ecosystem around the

343
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:44,410
hardware and again if you're interested

344
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:48,300
in body hacking or medical implants you

345
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:53,199
know about ecosystems that service parts

346
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:57,670
consumables features and chillingly data

347
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:59,890
about the products owners because while

348
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:02,349
you may not be able to monetize that

349
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:04,330
data now there might be someone who buys

350
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,230
the company later just for access to

351
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,390
that data

352
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,790
now obviously making sure that people

353
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:11,439
buy service parts consumables and so on

354
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,660
from you that's a commercial preference

355
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,279
not illegal right but if you have a

356
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,380
software enabled device that is a device

357
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,120
with copyrighted works inside of it and

358
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,160
you design that device so that using

359
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,010
third-party ink or using third-party

360
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,050
parts or making third-party service or

361
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:29,339
adding a third-party app requires

362
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:31,900
bypassing DRM then that legal right that

363
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:34,390
that commercial preference becomes an

364
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,670
ironclad legal right that will be

365
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,220
enforced at public expense by the

366
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,050
government and that is why DRM is now

367
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:44,080
metastasized that's why DRM is now in

368
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:45,609
cars if you want to fix a GM car you

369
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,110
need to read Diagnostics out of the

370
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,700
engine to read Diagnostics out of the

371
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,320
engine you either break the DRM commit a

372
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,990
felony and potentially go to jail for

373
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,870
five years or you buy grm GM's official

374
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:57,370
diagnostic tool to they $75,000 tool

375
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,339
with the cost of goods of one hundred

376
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:02,170
dollars it's in tractors John Deere uses

377
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:03,820
DRM to make sure that the data that you

378
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:06,069
generate the telemetry about your own

379
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,410
field as you drive your field around

380
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,940
your back forty and the torque sensors

381
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,550
on the wheels and the humidity sensors

382
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,800
under on the undercarriage deliver

383
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:18,130
telemetry on a centimeter accurate basis

384
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,959
about your field John Deere locks that

385
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:23,410
data up and sells it to you with apps

386
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:26,020
that do data dispersal or seed dispersal

387
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:28,990
that come as a bundle with seed from

388
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:31,630
companies like Monsanto and Cargill it's

389
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,790
in thermostats it's in baby monitors

390
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,779
it's in voting machines it's in

391
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,449
pacemakers

392
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:40,180
it's an implanted defibrillators it's an

393
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:41,350
insulin pumps and to see yeses ago we

394
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,359
discovered that it was in one of these

395
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,640
beauties the Internet of Things

396
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,079
rectal thermometer that has literally

397
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:52,630
put DRM up your literal actual ass if

398
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:56,050
there is any phrase more terrifying than

399
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:59,350
neural interface beta tester its inkjet

400
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:01,089
printer business model in your body so

401
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:03,970
what does this have to do with security

402
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:05,980
well DRM as I said before it works by

403
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,579
hiding keys and user accessible

404
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:12,279
equipment and that requires obfuscation

405
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:13,750
users can't know how their computers

406
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:16,000
work because if they know how their

407
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:20,709
computers work then they can turn off

408
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,589
the DRM so in normal crypto in normal

409
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:25,709
security we talk about this eternal love

410
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:28,149
triangle of Alice and Bob and Carol

411
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:30,910
Alice and Bob want to communicate with

412
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:32,399
one another and Carol wants to find out

413
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:35,740
what they're saying to each other and

414
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,570
Alice and Bob feel confident that they

415
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,070
can send messages over public networks

416
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,899
over satellite links that have a

417
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:43,720
footprint that spans a continent over

418
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:46,540
Wi-Fi networks that anyone can join or

419
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,760
over the internet which telecoms and

420
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,620
other intermediaries sit between when

421
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,540
any one of those parties could be Carol

422
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:55,060
right Carol could be AT&T helping the

423
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,099
NSA or Carol could be hackers who are

424
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,109
inside your LAN or Carol could be any

425
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,730
one of a number of people and yet Alice

426
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:04,059
and Bob feel okay but sending the

427
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:06,309
messages to each other because they have

428
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:08,049
a public algorithm that is well

429
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:10,959
understood right they they tell everyone

430
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:12,579
how their crypto works that's a really

431
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,959
important step you know before we had

432
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:15,750
science we had a thing that was a lot

433
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,650
like science it was called alchemy

434
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,540
alchemists did more or less what

435
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,730
scientists do they would form on a

436
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,709
hypothesis about the natural world and

437
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,419
they would formulate an experiment to

438
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,490
see whether or not their hypothesis was

439
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,260
true but then they wouldn't tell anyone

440
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,390
what they thought they discovered and so

441
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,950
they were subject to the most common of

442
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,350
human frailties which is our endless

443
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,640
capacity for self-deception which is why

444
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,899
every Alchemist discovered and the

445
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,740
hardest way possible that you shouldn't

446
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,360
drink mercury and when alchemists began

447
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,220
publishing their findings right

448
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,229
subjecting themselves to adversarial

449
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,630
peer review they finally did something

450
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,240
alchemical they converted the base metal

451
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:55,750
of superstition into the precious matter

452
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,650
of science because they let people tell

453
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,560
them about

454
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:01,780
foolish mistakes and so Alice and Bob

455
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,070
they published their crypto and they let

456
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,420
everyone tell them about the dumb

457
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:07,570
mistakes they made they published their

458
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:10,480
implementation too so they know that

459
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,889
that their crypto works and that means

460
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,920
that the only thing they have to keep

461
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:17,020
secret from Carol is the key because

462
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,450
they know of thanks to peer review that

463
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,610
you can take you know your pocket

464
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,530
destruction rectangle and you can stick

465
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:26,350
a file on it and then you can use its

466
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:27,879
thin processing power to scramble a

467
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,649
message so thoroughly that if all the

468
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,870
hydrogen atoms in the universe for

469
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,910
computers and they did nothing until the

470
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:36,010
heat death of the universe but labor to

471
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,630
figure out what that key was that you

472
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,910
would run out of universe long before

473
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,710
you ran out of possible keys so Alice

474
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,810
and Bob feel very confident in

475
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:45,460
communicating with one another even

476
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:47,740
though Carol can intercept their message

477
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,150
and even though Carol knows what crypto

478
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,700
system they're using to scramble their

479
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:53,860
message but DRM doesn't have Alice and

480
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:57,840
Bob and Carol DRM just has Alice and Bob

481
00:18:53,860 --> 00:19:00,610
like Netflix is Bob and you are Carol

482
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,980
are alice rather and Netflix wants to

483
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:05,889
send you a movie that's been encrypted

484
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,660
scrambled and they want you to use their

485
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:09,610
player to descramble it because their

486
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,560
player doesn't have a save as button and

487
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,030
that way you can't save it and watch it

488
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,740
later if you cancel your Netflix

489
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,840
subscription or share it with people who

490
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:20,200
aren't Netflix subscribers and so they

491
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:23,290
hide the key in the player which they

492
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:26,230
then give to you so in the Netflix model

493
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:29,290
is just Alice and Bob Bob sends Alice

494
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,580
the key Bob says to Alice please forget

495
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,980
this key as soon as you're done do

496
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,750
scrambling my message if a technical

497
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,660
term for this in security circles it's

498
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:42,220
called wishful thinking and so DRM

499
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:46,330
doesn't work even well-designed DRM is

500
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:50,760
fails to work and is a kind of fertile

501
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:55,810
ground for growing malware in in 2005

502
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:59,080
Sony shipped out Sony BMG shipped out

503
00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:01,870
six million audio CDs 51 titles and

504
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,060
these CDs had a second session on them a

505
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:06,459
machine-readable data session that

506
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:09,520
contained a rootkit that exploded a

507
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,510
zero-day bug in Windows it would patch

508
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,190
your kernel

509
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:14,140
and make your computer and capable of

510
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,990
seeing files that began with the string

511
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,190
dollar sign sys dollar sign and then

512
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:21,250
what they did was they wrote some

513
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:22,420
software into your startup routine that

514
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,100
would load and become permanently

515
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,210
resident that started with that string

516
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,459
that would try and see if you were

517
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:29,170
ripping CDs and interdict it and as soon

518
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,420
as they did this malware authors went ah

519
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:33,340
ha if I just start my malware with

520
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,900
dollar sign sys dollar sign it will be

521
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,959
invisible to the user and their

522
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,940
antivirus software and by the time this

523
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,290
became public knowledge long after was

524
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,210
discovered because the security

525
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,980
researchers who discovered it we're told

526
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,080
by their general counsel that they would

527
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,760
risk DMCA prosecution if they came

528
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,970
forward with it but when it was finally

529
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,530
made public at least 300,000 US

530
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,480
government and military networks had

531
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:58,200
been infected with this rootkit that

532
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,720
made them vulnerable to two

533
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,760
opportunistic infections but DRM doesn't

534
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,150
work well even when it does all of this

535
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,920
harm so the DMCA not only prohibits

536
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:11,890
tampering with DRM it prohibits

537
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,660
disclosure of defects and DRM because if

538
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,310
I tell you about a mistake the

539
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,860
programmer made in your iPhone or your

540
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:20,200
smart lightbulb or your smart rectal

541
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,360
thermometer then you know where to go to

542
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,350
start dismantling the DRM so that you

543
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,949
can bypass it

544
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:28,689
so last year you're in a year and a half

545
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,480
ago now in 2015 the Copyright Office

546
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,070
held its regular every three years

547
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,230
hearing on whether or not this stuff was

548
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:37,210
working out right and they heard from

549
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:39,460
some of the world's pre-eminent security

550
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,740
researchers about the way that this and

551
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,870
the internet of things had collided to

552
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:46,420
create untold mischief they heard from

553
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:48,699
researchers like Edie Felton who was

554
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:50,590
then the by the time the proceedings and

555
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,930
ended the deputy CTO of the White House

556
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:55,720
J Radcliffe type 1 diabetic who's a

557
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:57,070
principal investigator at rapid7 Alex

558
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,230
Halderman at the University of Michigan

559
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,659
Matt Blais Matt Green Bruce Schneier

560
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:03,700
names to conjure within the security

561
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:07,420
world and they came forward and said

562
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:09,220
that under the DMCA their counsel had

563
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,870
told them that they needed permission

564
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,840
from companies to make disclosures

565
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:16,239
without incurring legal risk which meant

566
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,949
that the companies got a veto over who

567
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,120
could reveal embarrassing facts about

568
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,910
their dumb mistakes

569
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,779
for obvious reasons corporations are not

570
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:26,590
good custodians a

571
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:29,090
true facts about their own errors

572
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:31,609
preventing disclosure does not prevent

573
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,379
discovery it just means that the

574
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:35,718
vulnerabilities that are discovered

575
00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:37,820
do not become publicly known until they

576
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:41,059
are so widely exploited by people who

577
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:43,460
weaponize them spies cops industrial

578
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:46,129
espionage practitioners malware creeps

579
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:48,169
voyeurs and other bad people that it's

580
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:50,238
only once they're so widespread that

581
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:52,460
they're undeniable that the rest of us

582
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:55,149
find out that these vulnerabilities are

583
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:57,499
lurking in systems that we depend on

584
00:22:55,149 --> 00:23:00,139
this is why the Internet of Things

585
00:22:57,499 --> 00:23:02,869
dumpster fire continues to rage it's why

586
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:04,879
Brian Krebs a security researcher faced

587
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:06,619
a six hundred and twenty gigabit per

588
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:09,248
second denial of service attack in

589
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:11,449
September he had outed a couple of

590
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:15,919
twenty-something Israeli denial of

591
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:18,739
service creeps petty criminals and they

592
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,979
used the Mirai Internet of Things worms

593
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:24,289
which used hijacked embedded systems to

594
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:26,029
attack him with a traffic flood that was

595
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:28,129
so big it's more like the kind of thing

596
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:30,320
we see nation-states deploying deploying

597
00:23:28,129 --> 00:23:32,509
against each other but had been deployed

598
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,839
in this case by a couple of dum-dums who

599
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:37,339
are running a petty crime where ring now

600
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:40,158
the source code for that piece of

601
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:42,710
malware that they exploited was is Mirai

602
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,570
that was eventually dumped a week later

603
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:46,249
and the security researchers who

604
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:49,700
analyzed it they call it amateurish and

605
00:23:46,249 --> 00:23:51,859
clumsy and a week after that Mirai had

606
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,019
infected systems in every country in the

607
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:54,949
world that had reliable electricity and

608
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:57,679
Internet access

609
00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:00,739
ten days after that the Mirai worm was

610
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:03,200
used to direct traffic floods against

611
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:06,589
core Internet infrastructure level three

612
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,239
DNS Twitter PayPal knocking some of the

613
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:10,820
best defended services on the internet

614
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:13,009
offline so this fire will rage for a

615
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,289
long time and there is no obvious way to

616
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:16,309
patch most of these systems even if we

617
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,809
fix these problems in the next

618
00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:19,999
generation they will lurk and the

619
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:22,639
previous generations of systems as they

620
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:25,239
sit there festering until their duty

621
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:28,070
cycle runs out until they're thrown away

622
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:30,409
but attacks that harness your equipment

623
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:32,539
to hit third parties they're just the

624
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:33,950
beginning they're really scary stuff

625
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:35,539
especially when we're talking about

626
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,190
embedded systems in our own bodies

627
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:37,669
happens when people harness your

628
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,269
embedded

629
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:44,149
to attack you the real risk is that

630
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:46,879
these devices which are designed to

631
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:49,549
treat their users as adversaries and

632
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:51,799
designed to obfuscate their operations

633
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:54,349
designed to gather as much information

634
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:57,079
about their users as possible in case

635
00:24:54,349 --> 00:24:59,570
that turns out to be a venda Belasco

636
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:01,879
designed to be illegal to report

637
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:04,369
vulnerabilities in when those are used

638
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:07,549
to direct attacks against the people who

639
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:09,439
depend on them directly you've heard

640
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:11,239
stories of what this looks like you may

641
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,759
have heard about remote access trojan

642
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:15,409
people routers remote access Trojans

643
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,479
that's malware that hijacks your camera

644
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:20,629
your microphone your keyboard your

645
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:24,799
harddrive and can be used to covertly

646
00:25:20,629 --> 00:25:27,678
spy on you in 2013 Miss Teen USA Cassidy

647
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:31,039
wolf visited a website that had been

648
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,139
hacked by I'm radder that radder was

649
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,329
looking for browser configurations that

650
00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:37,579
were vulnerable to some bugs that they

651
00:25:35,329 --> 00:25:39,379
had in their toolkit Cassidy Wolf's

652
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:41,479
happened to be vulnerable so he this

653
00:25:39,379 --> 00:25:43,519
creep was able to take over her computer

654
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:46,249
he then used her camera to covertly

655
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,049
capture incidental nude images of her he

656
00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:50,479
also captured her social media logins

657
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:52,099
and passwords and he sent her emails

658
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:54,019
saying I have these nude pictures of you

659
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:56,269
which I will post to your accounts on

660
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:59,269
social media unless you perform sex acts

661
00:25:56,269 --> 00:26:02,419
for me on camera she by dint of being

662
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:04,909
Miss Teen USA had access to counsel and

663
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:06,919
to more resources than most of this

664
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:08,329
guy's victims so she called the FBI and

665
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:09,859
they arrested this guy he had over a

666
00:26:08,329 --> 00:26:11,719
hundred victims including many minor

667
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:13,820
children a few months later the FBI

668
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:16,669
raided another radder ring they netted a

669
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:18,678
hundred riders the most prolific of whom

670
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:23,209
had four hundred victims including many

671
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:26,119
children now summer before last there

672
00:26:23,209 --> 00:26:28,909
was this the celebrated G pack Chrysler

673
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:32,589
made these jeeps that have hotspots on

674
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:35,899
demand you can pay $10 on your in bash

675
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:38,719
system and turn on a hotspot driven from

676
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:40,820
a sprint sim that's in the in the cars

677
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:44,119
informatics system keep your children

678
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:46,339
entertained on long car rides the major

679
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:47,958
security model for this was the

680
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:51,129
assumption that nobody used sprint and

681
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:53,560
so when security researchers

682
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:55,510
got themselves another sprint sim they

683
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,429
discovered not only could they penetrate

684
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:59,530
these systems but that they've been

685
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:01,570
cross connected into the cars own

686
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:04,690
networks and so they could take over the

687
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:06,850
steering the brakes the transmission the

688
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,110
windshield wipers the entertainment

689
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:10,689
system and so on Chrysler had two

690
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:14,080
recalled 1.4 million jeeps in December

691
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:16,810
2015 and then a year ago this month in

692
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:20,830
San Francisco there was a news cycle

693
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:23,169
about mom whose three year old kept

694
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,699
saying mummy the phone in my room talks

695
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:27,880
to me at night and it scares me that was

696
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,320
that was the kids baby monitor and she

697
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,390
walked by the kid's room one night after

698
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,370
tucking him in and she heard a

699
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,380
stranger's voice swearing at her child

700
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:37,149
and she went in it was one of those baby

701
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,920
monitors that has the movable camera you

702
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,870
can steer with an app and the camera

703
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,940
swiveled around to look at her and a

704
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:47,439
stranger's voice said Oh mommy's in the

705
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:50,320
room and it went dead with section 12 of

706
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,720
one of the dmca we have given companies

707
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,120
every incentive they need to use the RM

708
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,310
and their products and but in so doing

709
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,409
we have given them the ability to end

710
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:01,659
private property as we understand it

711
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:04,090
because if the dead hand of the

712
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:07,060
manufacturer rests on your property even

713
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:08,560
after you paid for it ready to slap you

714
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,840
any time you commit the sin of not

715
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:13,090
ordering your affairs to the maximum

716
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,399
commercial advantage of their

717
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:18,669
shareholders then you are not the owner

718
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:21,850
of that property they are we are after

719
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:23,710
all only one RFID system away from a

720
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,810
dishwasher that won't take third party

721
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:27,880
dishes we are one vision system away

722
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:31,090
from a toaster that won't let you use

723
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:34,630
unauthorized bread now we have a name

724
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:36,159
for systems where only one special class

725
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,870
of people get to own property and

726
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,320
everyone else has to be a tenant of that

727
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,929
property

728
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,760
it's called feudalism and under

729
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:45,850
feudalism everyone who's not a lord is a

730
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,260
vassal a tenant farmer whose rights to

731
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:49,240
the land that they depend on are

732
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:52,480
determined by the whims of the Lords

733
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,820
they serve but in DRM feudalism the

734
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,700
aristocracy it's not even human beings

735
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:59,860
it's artificial immortal life-forms

736
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,380
colony organize and organisms called

737
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,290
limited liability corporations that the

738
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:06,510
US alternately as their foods

739
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:09,990
and their rather inconvenient gut flora

740
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:12,419
and it's getting worse the World Wide

741
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:14,970
Web Consortium has historically been the

742
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:17,700
great bastion of open web standards the

743
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:20,299
web standards that you will use to

744
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:23,100
control the devices you put in your body

745
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:25,740
they've decided they'll standardize DRM

746
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,330
to go in browsers as part of html5 with

747
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,730
something called encryption encrypted

748
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:33,210
media extensions these browsers that are

749
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:35,850
intended to be the control surface for

750
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:38,429
all smart actuated devices of the future

751
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:40,649
and an Electronic Frontier Foundation we

752
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:42,630
begged the w3c not to do this we told

753
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,940
them about the horrors of the DMCA and

754
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:47,190
they said well your problem is the DMCA

755
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:49,559
it's not the technology why don't you

756
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,940
fix that we said great let's fix it why

757
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:53,309
don't we make everyone who comes to the

758
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:56,010
w3c promises a condition of membership

759
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:58,020
that they won't invoke the DMCA against

760
00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:00,179
security researchers people who add

761
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:02,879
accessibility features people who

762
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:07,820
otherwise lawfully innovate and that

763
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:12,270
came to a vote and the vote was close

764
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:14,370
the w3c operates on consensus so in the

765
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:16,080
absence of a consensus Tim berners-lee

766
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:17,760
the inventor of the web and

767
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,510
unfortunately an advocate for this

768
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,620
decided that it would go forward anyway

769
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:24,840
now we were backed by some of the

770
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,639
world's leading research organizations

771
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:30,090
from Oxford University to Lawrence

772
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,040
Berkeley labs to King's College London

773
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:33,750
to Stanford

774
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,549
we were backed by some of the world's

775
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,169
leading disability rights organizations

776
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:39,389
the Royal National Institute for blind

777
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:41,820
people Benetech SSB Bart in Germany

778
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:44,280
Vision Australia and by a list of

779
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:48,350
hundreds of the world's top security

780
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:51,059
researchers and the w3c this morning

781
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:53,850
announced that it was going to go ahead

782
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:56,000
with publishing or calling a vote on

783
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:58,260
publishing encrypted media extensions

784
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,419
but that they would separately pursue

785
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:02,669
some best practices for security

786
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:05,190
research and disclosures but without any

787
00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:08,490
binding on the people who use this legal

788
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:12,090
weapon that they've developed well let's

789
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:13,950
get back to printers in 2011 on Qui who

790
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,689
was then a researcher at Columbia

791
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:17,290
University published an excellent paper

792
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,660
called print me

793
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:21,909
if you dare detailing the research he'd

794
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:24,010
done into vulnerabilities in HP's

795
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:26,080
printers so he'd learned that the way

796
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:27,850
that HP updates the firmware on their

797
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,500
printers is by just embedding some

798
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,270
special codes in PostScript the page

799
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,790
description language that printers

800
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:36,070
receive from your computer somewhere in

801
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:38,020
that document you you embed a postscript

802
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:40,570
line that says operating system starts

803
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:42,700
here and everything read from then on is

804
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:45,639
automatically flashed into the printers

805
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:48,760
firmware and used as the new operating

806
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,710
system load for that printer so he

807
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:53,050
created poisoned documents documents

808
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:55,660
like resumes docx that he could send to

809
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:57,490
your company's HR department and they

810
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,920
would reflash any printer that printed

811
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,720
them the printers once reflashed would

812
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,090
send them copies of every document they

813
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,290
printed but they would also scan through

814
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,760
those documents for anything that

815
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,590
pattern matched a credit-card number or

816
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,720
social security number save them to a

817
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:12,750
separate file and send him those they

818
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,970
would also crawl the local area network

819
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:18,100
using a toolkit of known vulnerabilities

820
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,050
looking for computers to exploit and

821
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,490
take over and then open a reverse shell

822
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:23,440
to his computer through your firewall

823
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:25,240
which would allow him to operate a

824
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,270
command and control server that took

825
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,130
over your whole local area network now

826
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:32,080
cui he picked on HP not because he

827
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:33,250
thought that they were like the worst of

828
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,970
the business but because they were the

829
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,260
most successful

830
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:36,760
you know you rob banks because that's

831
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,770
where the money is and he figured

832
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,150
whatever vulnerability they had that

833
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:43,629
would be the most widely exploitable

834
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:45,100
vulnerability so HP which remains number

835
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,810
one in the business they can take

836
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:49,659
they've started using security updates

837
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:52,480
to transmit sneak attack time bombs in

838
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:54,490
their equipment and for the first time

839
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,640
they have created an incentive for

840
00:32:54,490 --> 00:33:01,330
people not to install timely security

841
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:03,190
updates HP is a dress rehearsal for the

842
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:06,850
future of the internet of vulnerable

843
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:09,460
legal to audit things on fire every H

844
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:11,860
every incentive that HP had to remote

845
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:15,820
break its customers property is present

846
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:18,070
for all of those IOT companies we have

847
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:20,710
to fix this I've been giving a lot of

848
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:22,330
thought to two parallel movements that

849
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:25,270
started around the first time I came to

850
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:28,419
Austin for the first Southwest South by

851
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:29,920
Southwest Interactive Festival those two

852
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,970
things they're the open web and the free

853
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,159
software movement

854
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:35,260
they both started around the same time

855
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:37,419
and one of them has succeeded the

856
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:41,350
free-software movement has absolutely

857
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:43,799
succeeded you know you you use Linux and

858
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:46,990
BSD computers in your pocket to talk to

859
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:48,730
free and open operating systems in the

860
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:51,429
cloud in free and open containers

861
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:53,289
running on free and open firmware you do

862
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:55,419
have a wind book or a MacBook but it's a

863
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:57,129
dumb terminal to talk to a free and open

864
00:33:55,419 --> 00:34:01,120
operating system somewhere in the cloud

865
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:04,179
almost all the time uh and at the same

866
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,520
time and over the same period the open

867
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:08,168
web has become the closed web we went

868
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,449
from don't be evil to surveillance

869
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:12,730
business model in a couple of decades

870
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:14,259
and I've been wondering how this

871
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,240
happened because it's mostly the same

872
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,280
people when you look at like who was

873
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,949
involved in the free and open web and

874
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,480
who was involved in free and open code

875
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:24,158
they were like going to the same parties

876
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,139
getting married to each other

877
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,879
skipping from one nonprofit or

878
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:29,470
for-profit to the other cross funding

879
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:31,509
each other giving each other sofa space

880
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:33,848
to crash on presenting together at

881
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:35,139
conferences like this so how did one

882
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:37,330
group succeed in the other one failed

883
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:38,830
and I think I know the answer I think

884
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:41,440
the answer is that when you open your

885
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:43,659
code you assign it on a revocable

886
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,659
license a license that you yourself

887
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:49,300
can't go back on and so you can't make a

888
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:52,270
compromise not even a really tiny one

889
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:54,730
and the thing about compromises is that

890
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:56,859
one compromise leads to another because

891
00:34:54,730 --> 00:35:00,099
the human sensory apparatus is only

892
00:34:56,859 --> 00:35:02,319
attuned to relative differences right

893
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:04,210
you make a little change and then you

894
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,710
ponder another little change you don't

895
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,720
compare it to where you were before you

896
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:10,240
started you compare it to where you are

897
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,560
now and each little change is only a

898
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,750
little change from the last little

899
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,009
change but one little change leads to

900
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,540
another little change leads to another

901
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:19,750
little change in before you know it

902
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:23,410
you're suing to put your name on a

903
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:24,490
one-click patent or to make api's

904
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:28,359
copyrightable

905
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:30,640
or to insist on a real names policy or

906
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:32,259
to say that your Terms of Service are

907
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,890
legally binding under the Computer Fraud

908
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:37,780
and Abuse Act so we need to figure out

909
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:39,580
how we can bind ourselves to the mast

910
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:42,310
today when we are young and idealistic

911
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:44,970
and sticking things in our bodies so

912
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:47,580
that later on when some of us pirates

913
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,930
become Admirals they can't make the

914
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,340
little change that leads to the little

915
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:53,790
change that leads to the little change

916
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:57,090
so I'm gonna propose today two sets of

917
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:59,190
two principles a kind of Magna Carta for

918
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,810
your movement in mind for all of the

919
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,670
technology movements that we build from

920
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:05,369
here on out when all of these issues

921
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:08,700
have become so much more pointed

922
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:10,710
these build on EFS proposal to the World

923
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,839
Wide Web Consortium and they lay a

924
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,609
groundwork for a future in which devices

925
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,369
are responsive to their owners and

926
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:18,598
transparent in their operations the

927
00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:21,690
first of these principles is this

928
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:24,420
devices should always obey their owners

929
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:25,980
when a device receives conflicting

930
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,619
instructions from the remote party

931
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,960
whether that's the manufacturer a police

932
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:34,920
agency operating a lawful interception

933
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:38,160
override or crypto backdoor a spyware or

934
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:40,530
malware creep or anyone else including

935
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,990
someone trying to brick some something

936
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:45,030
that's been stolen because this is not

937
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:47,939
an unalloyed good it takes away some of

938
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:50,070
our useful use cases whenever a device

939
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,589
gets conflicting owner or orders from

940
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:54,270
its owner and a third party it should

941
00:36:52,589 --> 00:36:57,720
always a hundred percent of the time

942
00:36:54,270 --> 00:37:00,089
obey its owner the second principle is

943
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,129
that true facts about the security of

944
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:05,549
systems that people depend on should

945
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:08,310
always be legal to disclose under every

946
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:10,560
circumstance there should never be any

947
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,869
impediment to telling someone that the

948
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,330
computer that they depend on is not fit

949
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:17,910
for use and I charge you to be

950
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:19,799
hard-liners for these principles if they

951
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,839
don't call you a fanatic and a Puritan

952
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,010
about these principles you are not

953
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,619
trying hard enough

954
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:28,020
if you aren't on totally uncompromising

955
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:30,570
in these principles you set the stage

956
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:32,820
for long-term harms that are worse than

957
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:35,490
any short-term benefit that you can gain

958
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,650
by compromising on them if you

959
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:40,169
computerized the world and your bodies

960
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:42,690
and don't safeguard the users of

961
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:44,880
computers from coercive control history

962
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:47,190
will not remember you as the heroes of

963
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,010
technology but as the blind handmaidens

964
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:52,680
of tyranny what are we gonna do about

965
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:54,930
this how we gonna make this real well

966
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,790
not through individual action you can't

967
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:59,308
recycle your way out of climate change

968
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:01,619
on your own and you cannot

969
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:04,259
fix these problems on your own with your

970
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:06,690
own personal technology decisions we

971
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:08,700
need collective action to solve these

972
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:10,739
problems and at the Electronic Frontier

973
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,399
Foundation we are doing something about

974
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:12,869
this

975
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,239
we've running we're running this project

976
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:16,349
called Apollo 1201 named after section

977
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:18,479
12 one of the DMCA

978
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:20,400
and the Apollo mission it's a 10-year

979
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:20,848
mission to kill all of the DRM in the

980
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,450
world

981
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:25,559
within a decade now we've started this

982
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:28,019
with a bang

983
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:30,410
last summer we sued the US government to

984
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:34,379
invalidate section 1201 of the DMCA

985
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:36,899
we're representing two great clients who

986
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,819
may be familiar to you one is Johns

987
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,690
Hopkins security researcher Matthew

988
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:42,450
Greene

989
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:44,819
matt has a National Science Foundation

990
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:46,078
grant and a book deal to investigate the

991
00:38:44,819 --> 00:38:48,690
security of a number of systems

992
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,759
including medical implants and medical

993
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:52,890
diagnostic equipment but also voting

994
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:55,380
machines the black boxes at payment

995
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:57,450
processing sister system systems that do

996
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,549
high-speed payment processing and

997
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:01,799
validation and many other systems

998
00:38:59,549 --> 00:39:04,319
we're also representing a legendary

999
00:39:01,799 --> 00:39:06,538
hardware hacker an adjunct at the MIT

1000
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:09,680
Media Lab called bunny Wang Andrew bunny

1001
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:12,029
Wang the guy who broke the Xbox bunny is

1002
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,098
someone who spent his whole life waiting

1003
00:39:12,029 --> 00:39:16,049
for a fight like this he told me that he

1004
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:17,400
and his girlfriend never got married

1005
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:19,469
because he wanted to have separate

1006
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,009
finances in case the lawsuit that came

1007
00:39:19,469 --> 00:39:25,380
ended up bankrupting him and bunny he

1008
00:39:23,009 --> 00:39:28,739
makes a piece of hardware that allows

1009
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:32,339
you to inject bitmaps into HDCP signals

1010
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:33,719
the the high-res video signals like the

1011
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:35,849
one that's going for my computer to

1012
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:38,190
there and do an overlay it's used in

1013
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:39,989
bars all over the world to say like

1014
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:42,599
half-price drinks for the next half hour

1015
00:39:39,989 --> 00:39:46,109
and the bottom third beneath the sports

1016
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,009
match he wants to improve this he's

1017
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:49,078
figured out how to do this without

1018
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:50,940
having to decrypt HDCP so it doesn't

1019
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:53,609
break the DMCA he wants to improve it by

1020
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,469
adding recording features so since both

1021
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:57,210
of these people are entering into

1022
00:39:55,469 --> 00:39:59,069
courses of action that credibly run

1023
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:02,190
afoul of the criminal provisions of the

1024
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:04,799
DMCA of section 1201 they both have

1025
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:07,200
standing to sue the US government to

1026
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:09,900
determine the constitutionality of this

1027
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,269
law and we have a variety of arguments

1028
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,869
but one of the key ones is that code is

1029
00:40:12,269 --> 00:40:14,999
speech

1030
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:17,099
that the way programmers express

1031
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:18,720
themselves is by writing software and

1032
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:22,200
this is a principle that is

1033
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,578
well-established in law in 1992 we won

1034
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,439
one of our first and most important

1035
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:27,299
cases I have to say our first first case

1036
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,730
was representing steve jackson games

1037
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:31,200
here in austin where we established that

1038
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:33,749
you needed a warrant to look at email

1039
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,549
but our second-most important case was

1040
00:40:33,749 --> 00:40:37,379
when we represented Daniel J Bernstein

1041
00:40:35,549 --> 00:40:38,970
who was then a a grad student the

1042
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,690
University of California at Berkeley and

1043
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,538
a cryptographer

1044
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:45,630
and he was publishing crypto on Usenet

1045
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:48,990
and he's publishing this strong crypto

1046
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:51,089
that exceeded the maximum strength the

1047
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:53,578
NSA allowed for civilian use they

1048
00:40:51,089 --> 00:40:55,740
classed as a munition and so we sued the

1049
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:58,559
US government on his behalf and we said

1050
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:01,200
he has the First Amendment right to

1051
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:02,759
publish his source code and nonlin to

1052
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,680
the Ninth Circuit uphold us they upheld

1053
00:41:02,759 --> 00:41:06,769
it at the Appellate Division and the ban

1054
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:09,269
on strong crypto disappeared forever

1055
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:10,740
which is why you can validate the

1056
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:13,499
software load on your implanted

1057
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:16,200
pacemaker defibrillator before you

1058
00:41:13,499 --> 00:41:20,098
install it and so we think that we have

1059
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:22,558
some very good law to rest on and this

1060
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:24,599
is gonna take a long time to come to

1061
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:26,009
baked come to fruit it's gonna take 10

1062
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:29,130
years probably to get all the way

1063
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:31,440
through the Supreme Court and during

1064
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:34,529
that ten years the landscape is changing

1065
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,230
for breaking DRM today if you were to go

1066
00:41:34,529 --> 00:41:39,150
to your general counsel and say I've got

1067
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:41,279
an idea for a product that breaks DRM

1068
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:43,140
and makes us some money do you think we

1069
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:44,720
should do it your general counsel might

1070
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,950
look at the jurisprudence today and say

1071
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,169
it's pretty risky I don't think you

1072
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:50,609
should but once we start winning in the

1073
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:53,099
lower courts all of a sudden this

1074
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:55,470
becomes indeterminate there are people

1075
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:57,779
who are risk tolerant enough and who see

1076
00:41:55,470 --> 00:42:01,200
enough of an upside from for example

1077
00:41:57,779 --> 00:42:03,660
making a $500 version of GM's $75,000

1078
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,519
tool and making a mere five hundred

1079
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:07,680
percent markup by allowing people to fix

1080
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:10,890
their own cars that we imagine that

1081
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:13,109
people will start to take bets on our

1082
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:15,569
case coming out the right way and

1083
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:17,220
starting those businesses now every

1084
00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:18,960
country in the world has a version of

1085
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,519
the DMCA thanks to the US Trade

1086
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,739
Representative with one exception

1087
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:26,060
that's Israel which for complicated

1088
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:28,940
reasons that have nothing to do with DRM

1089
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:31,160
is able to pick and choose which US

1090
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,780
Trade Representative demands they accede

1091
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,730
to which ones they don't and the

1092
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,890
Israelis have become very interested in

1093
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:39,080
the last couple of months in starting an

1094
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,670
export business in breaking DRM which is

1095
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,950
yet another reason to start thinking

1096
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:44,870
about breaking DRM here and the United

1097
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:47,180
Kingdom where DRM law came through the

1098
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:49,790
European Union copyright directive 2001

1099
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:52,129
they're now reconsidering all of their

1100
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:54,770
European laws and what if there is a

1101
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:56,540
market to be made in breaking DRM

1102
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:59,509
there's a good reason for them to

1103
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:00,710
reconsider that law the exciting thing

1104
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,420
about this is you don't have to give a

1105
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,860
damn about security you don't have to

1106
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,120
give a damn about consumer freedom you

1107
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:07,670
don't have to give a damn about any of

1108
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:10,100
this stuff to want to break DRM you can

1109
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:12,890
merely want to get rich as hell and if

1110
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,960
you do you help us and we think that

1111
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:16,759
when we get there

1112
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:19,430
we will find ourselves in a position

1113
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:22,130
where the court will review the all of

1114
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:25,609
this activity in the world and say you

1115
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:27,980
know it would bring the court into

1116
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:31,070
disrepute it would be it would make us

1117
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:33,620
look like fools to maintain this ban

1118
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:36,050
just as they did with the VCR in 1984

1119
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:37,609
where there were six million VCRs in

1120
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:39,590
America's living rooms at the end of

1121
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:41,300
eight years of litigation and each of

1122
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:43,670
the Supreme Court justices drove past a

1123
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,900
video rental store to get to the Supreme

1124
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:47,360
Court on the morning they ruled on

1125
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:48,800
Betamax and when they got there they

1126
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,390
decided that they just couldn't ban a

1127
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,010
thing that was in so many American

1128
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:54,680
living rooms as the court is

1129
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:58,990
constitutional its consequentialist

1130
00:43:54,680 --> 00:44:01,759
rather so I'm a science fiction writer

1131
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:03,830
this stuff is not science fiction this

1132
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,380
stuff is stuff that I'm working on as

1133
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:08,779
part of what I consider to be the real

1134
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,790
predictable technical reality on the

1135
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,410
ground today but because I'm a science

1136
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:15,020
fiction writer people often ask me if

1137
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:17,450
I'm optimistic or pessimistic about the

1138
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:18,980
future and the thing is that that's by

1139
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:21,379
way of asking me to make a prediction

1140
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:24,500
and science fiction writers socket

1141
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:26,630
making predictions we are Texas marksmen

1142
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,550
if you can forgive the expression we

1143
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:30,170
fire a shotgun into the side of the barn

1144
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:31,970
then we draw a target around the place

1145
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:34,160
where the pellets have hit and declare

1146
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:35,180
ourselves to be dead eyes science

1147
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,790
fiction's made a lot of predictions

1148
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:39,118
almost none of them have come true it

1149
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:42,058
would be amazing if some of

1150
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,740
hadn't and besides even if you could

1151
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:45,630
predict the future why would it matter

1152
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,649
you know if you were optimistic that all

1153
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,539
this stuff was going to come out okay

1154
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:50,160
and that we would be able to put our

1155
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:51,930
bodies and computers and put computers

1156
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,819
in our bodies without having to worry

1157
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:56,339
about all these shenanigans being

1158
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:57,690
visited upon us you should get up every

1159
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:59,730
morning and do everything you can to

1160
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:01,730
make sure that future arrives and if

1161
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:03,630
you're pessimistic and you think that

1162
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:06,150
entertainment law from the last

1163
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:07,470
millennium will create a situation in

1164
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:09,869
which we can never be the true

1165
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:11,700
custodians of the computers in our body

1166
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:14,099
and malware is allowed to flourish in

1167
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,868
these computers that are so intimately

1168
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:18,480
woven into the fabric of our lives if

1169
00:45:15,869 --> 00:45:21,269
you think that we're gonna be hawks lead

1170
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,220
into the full or well you should get up

1171
00:45:21,269 --> 00:45:25,618
every morning and do everything you

1172
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:28,950
could to make sure that doesn't happen

1173
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:30,390
because the future is predictable then

1174
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:32,009
we might as well kill ourselves now

1175
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:33,960
because nothing we do will make a

1176
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:35,880
difference so rather than being

1177
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:40,230
optimistic or pessimistic

1178
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:43,769
I am hopeful and hope is the belief that

1179
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:45,450
you can change things a little and from

1180
00:45:43,769 --> 00:45:47,069
that vantage point of things being a

1181
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:49,140
little better find a way to make them

1182
00:45:47,069 --> 00:45:52,529
better still the casualty of for every

1183
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:54,328
battle is the plan of attack and so

1184
00:45:52,529 --> 00:45:56,309
knowing how to get from A to Z is

1185
00:45:54,329 --> 00:45:57,839
largely irrelevant if you know that

1186
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:59,970
you're gonna have to try a new path

1187
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,589
around C but if you know how to get from

1188
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:03,180
A to B maybe you can navigate your way

1189
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:05,880
one step at a time through a

1190
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:08,879
hill-climbing algorithm all the way to Z

1191
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:11,789
so how can you express that hope well I

1192
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,950
have two things you can do the first is

1193
00:46:11,789 --> 00:46:14,819
to think about how you can head your

1194
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:17,910
bets

1195
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:20,249
I am a committed free software and free

1196
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:21,779
networks person and nevertheless every

1197
00:46:20,249 --> 00:46:23,249
morning I get up and give money to

1198
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:26,309
companies whose mission is to destroy

1199
00:46:23,249 --> 00:46:28,709
both of those it doesn't matter how pure

1200
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:30,809
you are if you live in the modern world

1201
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:33,690
you are contributing to your own

1202
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:35,910
downfall every vegetarian eventually

1203
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:37,950
meets a vegan every vegan eventually

1204
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:41,009
meets a breatharian it doesn't matter

1205
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:42,839
how pure you are so rather than trying

1206
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:44,519
to be pure I ask you to tie then I got

1207
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:46,739
this from Denise Cooper who's a great

1208
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:48,238
open source advocate every month she

1209
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:49,680
adds up how much money she's giving to

1210
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,109
companies that want to destroy the world

1211
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,960
she wants to live in and she diverts it

1212
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,098
to organization

1213
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,440
that are trying to save it from that

1214
00:46:54,099 --> 00:46:58,240
future and obviously I'm biased

1215
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,950
Electronic Frontier Foundation as an

1216
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,509
organization I've worked for for 15

1217
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:04,180
years off and on they don't give me any

1218
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:05,560
money I get my money from the MIT Media

1219
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,359
Lab they they have a grant through this

1220
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,770
activists and residents thing that pays

1221
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,810
for the work I do at EF half so this

1222
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:12,670
isn't about me but I've never seen an

1223
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:14,049
organization be smarter with its money

1224
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:16,030
they know how to squeeze a dollar till

1225
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:18,670
it haulers and here in Austin you've got

1226
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:21,010
BFF Austin which is the only chapter

1227
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:22,180
ever established a vff before they

1228
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:23,410
worked out that being an impact

1229
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,029
litigator with a bunch of people running

1230
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:27,399
around speaking for you could really

1231
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:28,869
screw up your court cases so EF FA was

1232
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,730
grandfathered in

1233
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:32,500
there's the ACLU we're doing some pretty

1234
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:34,030
important work these days the free

1235
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,640
software foundation of software freedom

1236
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:38,680
Conservancy there's been attack there's

1237
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,569
Human Rights data analysis group

1238
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,910
Creative Commons so many organizations

1239
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:44,230
back when I started doing this work

1240
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:45,790
there were a three or four and now

1241
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:49,150
there's so many I can't count them all

1242
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:52,509
and so you can tithe you can make a

1243
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:54,940
donation to save the future that you are

1244
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:57,520
contributing to the downfall of and then

1245
00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:00,700
more immediately you can talk about this

1246
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:02,920
with two people two not two randos not

1247
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:04,960
two people who are not technologically

1248
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,609
clued in everyone wants to use their

1249
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,010
mother is an example that that's a

1250
00:48:06,609 --> 00:48:11,140
horrible example no one designs

1251
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:12,849
technologies for moms so moms have to be

1252
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,180
total ninjas and figure out how to bend

1253
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:18,160
themselves to fit the technology like

1254
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:20,649
have a conversation with your boss right

1255
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:23,770
because no one has ever made technology

1256
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:25,570
so hard their boss can't use it and so

1257
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:27,460
bosses are really accustomed to the

1258
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:29,080
technology coming to them find a couple

1259
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:31,690
of people who are technologically clued

1260
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:33,640
in and explain this to them and then

1261
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:34,510
come back a week later and ask them if

1262
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,960
they're willing to have that

1263
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:40,690
conversation with two more people there

1264
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:43,180
is a lot on the line here a future where

1265
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:44,859
our devices obey us a future where we're

1266
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:48,009
allowed to warn ourselves about the

1267
00:48:44,859 --> 00:48:50,140
defects lurking in those devices and no

1268
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:53,440
one of us gets to choose which future

1269
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:55,720
we're going to arrive at but together we

1270
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,780
get a chance there's too much at stake

1271
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,959
not to fight with everything we have

1272
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,960
thank you

1273
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:07,870
[Applause]

1274
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:09,880
so I got a five-minute flash before but

1275
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:12,310
I thought I had some time for questions

1276
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,170
do I have to still have time okay I'd

1277
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:16,120
like to call alternately on people who

1278
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:17,320
identify as female or non-binary and

1279
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,609
then people who identify as male or

1280
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,970
non-binary as a way of getting some

1281
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:23,290
parity and also I remind you that a long

1282
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:24,339
rambling statement followed by what do

1283
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:27,700
you think of that is technically a

1284
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:29,200
question but not a good one so with that

1285
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,399
in mind is there anyone who identifies

1286
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:37,390
as female or non-binary who'd like to

1287
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:39,190
start the questioning I know all that

1288
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:40,629
was really non-controversial and so it

1289
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:46,350
may be that nobody has anything to say

1290
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:46,350
but yeah go ahead

1291
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:52,360
are there any vehicle manufacturers

1292
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:53,799
fighting against this no in fact they're

1293
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:56,290
all kind of going in the other way like

1294
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,630
dieselgate was kind of a hint of where

1295
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:59,800
all this stuff is going I was a

1296
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:01,180
commenter I wish I could remember his

1297
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,710
name who wrote about diesel gate and

1298
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:05,740
called it the era of demon-haunted

1299
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:07,750
things so Alchemist I mentioned them

1300
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:09,220
before alchemists used to think that the

1301
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,720
reason they got different results every

1302
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:13,839
time they ran their experiments is

1303
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:16,060
because God was punishing them for their

1304
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,980
hubris right not not that humans are

1305
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,240
shitty lab techs but that God was

1306
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:23,440
punishing them for their hubris that

1307
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:26,229
every time they tried to unpick the

1308
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,930
nature of creation that God would run

1309
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:31,330
around and rearrange the fabric of

1310
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:33,609
reality or demons would do it in order

1311
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:35,740
to stop them from from finding out how

1312
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:38,620
the world worked well Volkswagen made a

1313
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:40,750
demon haunted car right if you subject

1314
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:42,700
that car to scrutiny when you watch it

1315
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:45,160
it behaves differently than when you're

1316
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:47,669
not watching it it is a remarkable thing

1317
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:50,560
so you know Tesla that's everyone's

1318
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:52,660
dream car you know that the most clued

1319
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:55,420
in of the cars the least dinosaur come

1320
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:56,620
all Tesla's got terms of service that

1321
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,600
say that you're not allowed to drive

1322
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:01,060
uber in your Tesla that they are gonna

1323
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:03,339
like use you their firmware to try and

1324
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:05,590
stop you from driving in any rot

1325
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:09,910
rideshare except for their ride share

1326
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:11,770
with your car I mean your car in in this

1327
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:13,750
sense right because it's not your car

1328
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:14,650
ever and I guess until the 90 you're

1329
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:17,740
copyright on that

1330
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:19,620
software expires it's Tesla's car that

1331
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:22,990
you're dumb enough to pay them to drive

1332
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:24,940
and I think that's a universal among car

1333
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:26,410
manufacturers at this point I don't know

1334
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:28,120
if local motors they might be doing

1335
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:29,549
something but people are starting to

1336
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:32,080
poke around the edges at building

1337
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:33,760
trustable hardware stocks from the from

1338
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:36,040
the ground up so I mentioned bunny Wang

1339
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,380
before bunnies been working with

1340
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:41,320
Singaporean and Chinese manufacturers to

1341
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:42,940
marry two different kinds of openness so

1342
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,590
one is this Chinese idea of Gong Chi

1343
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:46,900
which I'm sure I'm pronouncing wrong

1344
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:50,170
which is a kind of de-facto openness

1345
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:52,810
where you get gear from manufacturers

1346
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:55,390
that comes with like schematics and API

1347
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:57,400
documentation but no license that allows

1348
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:59,109
you to use either of them and then the

1349
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,970
free and open source world where

1350
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:03,310
licenses and code all have to go

1351
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:05,379
together and going guys kind of just de

1352
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:07,150
facto right everyone just kind of shares

1353
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:09,130
stuff around and it just kind of happens

1354
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:10,570
it's kind of rough consensus running

1355
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:13,240
code and let's hope nobody ever Sue's

1356
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:14,950
anyone which is like it feels like a

1357
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:18,009
good way to run things until someone sue

1358
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:19,270
someone a bit like software patents when

1359
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:21,190
they kicked off we're like well only

1360
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:23,080
only like mature companies that actually

1361
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:26,200
build stuff will use software patents

1362
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:28,569
obviously and then you know 98% of the

1363
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:30,160
patent threats that are that are sent

1364
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:31,900
are now sent by companies that don't

1365
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,270
produce anything except lawsuits you

1366
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:36,370
know so Bunny is trying to marry

1367
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:38,259
open-source and Gong Chi he's making

1368
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:39,880
this thing called the novena which is an

1369
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:42,100
open-source motherboard

1370
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,780
where every component is free and open

1371
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:47,290
from the ground up so it's open-source

1372
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:49,450
hardware the firmware loads on things

1373
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:52,060
like the USB controller are open the

1374
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:54,549
bootloader is open everything is open

1375
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:58,900
all the way up and so like open as in

1376
00:52:54,550 --> 00:53:02,500
GPL it's pretty sexy and his idea is

1377
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:05,170
that as Moore's Law starts to peak and

1378
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:07,540
as the amount of computing that we shift

1379
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:09,790
into the cloud continues to increase the

1380
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:12,130
need to swap out computers every 18

1381
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:14,230
months even for heavy users Goes Down

1382
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:16,300
and so people might want to buy heirloom

1383
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:18,970
computers they're building beautiful

1384
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:21,730
handmade you know aircraft aluminum and

1385
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:23,230
wood and bamboo beautiful computers with

1386
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:24,580
these open-source logic boards in them

1387
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:26,350
that are like seven eight thousand

1388
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:28,569
dollars and he thinks he's got a market

1389
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:30,330
for it there but he's also doing at the

1390
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:33,640
because he wants there to be an open

1391
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:35,200
load an open stack for hardware that

1392
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,879
starts at the bootloader and works its

1393
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:45,720
way out all the way up to the operating

1394
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:45,720
system yep go ahead yeah

1395
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:12,580
who can help you with open with opening

1396
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,500
up insulin pumps today because there's

1397
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,250
real problems with them today and there

1398
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:20,920
really are

1399
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:22,950
so I mentioned Travis what's his name

1400
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:26,170
from from rapid7

1401
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:31,509
he's blank his name the guy from Rapid 7

1402
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:32,890
who filed in the in the hang on sorry

1403
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:34,860
nothing more exciting than watching

1404
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:38,370
someone go through papers J Radcliffe

1405
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:41,500
from rapid7 who's a tea one diabetic and

1406
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:43,270
he discovered that the insulin pump the

1407
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,800
wireless insulin pump that he was using

1408
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:46,810
that could kill him in his boots by

1409
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,580
dumping its entire load of insulin into

1410
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:51,330
his bloodstream and one go that it was

1411
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:53,560
really badly secured he won't use

1412
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,730
automated insulin pumps anymore even

1413
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,710
though as I mentioned before humans a

1414
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:58,030
really shitty lab techs and like you

1415
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,440
know pricking yourself measuring your

1416
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,550
own dose and putting your own bolus and

1417
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,470
especially when you're having blood

1418
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:04,270
sugar problems that have accompanying

1419
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:05,890
cognitive impairments it's gonna shorten

1420
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:08,800
your life and he's like I will take

1421
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:10,960
years off the end of my life to not have

1422
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,580
a wireless device that no one's allowed

1423
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,990
to fix that I know have serious

1424
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:16,180
vulnerabilities that is sitting there in

1425
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:17,950
my body there is a group called a

1426
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:20,319
closed-loop group that's working to

1427
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:22,450
write open firmware for insulin pumps

1428
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:25,180
and continuous glucose monitors that as

1429
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:28,089
the name implies closes the loop so

1430
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:30,640
you're reading insulin you're bola Singh

1431
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:32,550
you're reading blood sugar bola Singh

1432
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,810
and rereading the blood sugar and

1433
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:37,660
dialing in the dose using machine

1434
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:38,980
learning over time that adapts to the

1435
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:42,910
idiosyncratic way in which you

1436
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:46,780
metabolize insulin and sugar but at the

1437
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:49,029
same time when they blew the whistle on

1438
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:50,500
the problems with insulin pumps the

1439
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:52,150
major insulin pump manufacturers

1440
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,830
responded by adding DRM so that you

1441
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:55,600
couldn't they said it was so you

1442
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:57,640
couldn't put third-party firmware in of

1443
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:00,279
course you just have to break the DRM

1444
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:02,799
which is not hard but it also means that

1445
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:06,580
you can't report defects anymore without

1446
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:09,790
risking DMCA prosecution so you know

1447
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:12,700
it's it is a scary thing you know there

1448
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:16,150
there's unfortunately in a lot of these

1449
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:19,899
cases the answer that the people who are

1450
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:20,920
most close to the problem people people

1451
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,900
like

1452
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,910
J Radcliffe the answer they come up with

1453
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:28,780
is just don't use the machine which is a

1454
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:33,220
terrible answer right but you know it

1455
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:35,440
comes up again and again I had this

1456
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:37,120
argument with my wife we moved to

1457
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,100
California a year-and-a-half ago almost

1458
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:41,950
two years ago now and she came out ahead

1459
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:44,560
of us and bought a Dropcam for the house

1460
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:46,600
that we rented one of these canary

1461
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,820
cameras and it's got a motion sensor in

1462
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,830
an app and it signals your phone and

1463
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:51,940
shows you video if the motion sensor

1464
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:54,250
goes on while it thinks you're out of

1465
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:57,720
the house and I said I don't want a

1466
00:56:54,250 --> 00:57:00,490
network camera in our house and she said

1467
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:02,200
well how do you know it's not secure and

1468
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:04,029
I'm like well I don't have the chops to

1469
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,740
like dump its firmware and go through it

1470
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:08,230
line by line but I'll tell you what I'll

1471
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:11,410
look up its privacy policy and so I got

1472
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:15,190
to the FAQ and it said who can see video

1473
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:17,859
from my canary camera and the answer was

1474
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:19,330
we carefully vet which people in our

1475
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:21,520
data center are allowed to see the

1476
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:23,680
decrypted stream from your canary camera

1477
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,630
and I wrote to them and said so like by

1478
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,370
design this is not end-to-end by design

1479
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:29,260
third parties can see it and they said

1480
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:30,940
yes by design that's the case and it's

1481
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:32,890
the case for like not terrible reasons

1482
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:35,020
right like it's probably hard to build

1483
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:37,049
enough compute power into a cheap enough

1484
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:39,009
device to stick in your home to

1485
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:41,530
successfully distinguish things like

1486
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:42,790
pets from burglars and so to reduce the

1487
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:44,740
number of false positives and make it

1488
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:46,540
useful they wanted to crip the stream

1489
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:49,419
and do some post-processing it on their

1490
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:51,520
data center so it's impossible to do

1491
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:54,010
that economically and hardware in your

1492
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:55,720
living room and it's impossible to

1493
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:57,610
secure it if you let people in data

1494
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,470
center see it so what's the answer and

1495
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:02,860
the answer we came up with is you just

1496
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:04,600
don't have one right and that's like as

1497
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:07,180
someone who's a committed technophile

1498
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:09,670
who loves gadgets and watches unboxing

1499
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:11,500
videos for fun that is a hard answer to

1500
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:13,540
arrive at but that might be the answer

1501
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:15,010
in some of these cases at least until we

1502
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:17,110
can do things like build open firmware

1503
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:19,870
stacks when the ground-up reform some of

1504
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:21,820
these statutes and so on like you know

1505
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:23,830
my answer to how do you use Facebook in

1506
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:26,290
a way that's secure is I don't use

1507
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:27,430
Facebook and it means I miss parties and

1508
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:28,779
don't find out what's going on in my

1509
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:32,160
friends lives and there's lots of

1510
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:34,640
downsides to it and it's really hard to

1511
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:36,348
adequately judge the law

1512
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,210
term downside of things when there's an

1513
00:58:36,349 --> 00:58:40,819
immediate upside that so it's a takes a

1514
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:43,099
lot of self-discipline to do it and

1515
00:58:40,819 --> 00:58:44,599
particularly when it's it's something

1516
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:46,579
where the benefits are networked where

1517
00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:48,349
you and your friends all benefit

1518
00:58:46,579 --> 00:58:49,309
together from all of you taking part in

1519
00:58:48,349 --> 00:58:51,140
it

1520
00:58:49,309 --> 00:58:52,760
but it's a thing that we just end up

1521
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:54,710
having to do which feels like a weird

1522
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,029
thing to say to a roomful of people who

1523
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:57,859
are interested in putting computers in

1524
00:58:56,029 --> 00:58:59,900
their bodies or engaging with synthetic

1525
00:58:57,859 --> 00:59:00,920
biology maybe we just shouldn't do it

1526
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:03,440
because we don't know how to make it

1527
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:05,779
safe but there are domains in which I am

1528
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,339
expert enough I'm not an expert enough

1529
00:59:05,779 --> 00:59:09,589
in your domain but I'm expert enough in

1530
00:59:07,339 --> 00:59:15,009
my domain to say that you just shouldn't

1531
00:59:09,589 --> 00:59:15,009
do this stuff yes ma'am

1532
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:43,700
so the question is have we thought about

1533
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,930
using product liability to go after HP

1534
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,710
because it's not working the way that

1535
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:47,660
you thought it would

1536
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:49,520
I think HP's answer would be it was

1537
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:54,770
never advertised as being able to do

1538
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:56,480
that that they that that you know if you

1539
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:58,490
get the box somewhere on the box or in

1540
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:02,720
the fine print it says you know works

1541
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:04,490
with HP original ink cartridges we have

1542
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:07,279
we did in fact look for older

1543
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:09,080
advertising materials that said that in

1544
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,070
the Internet Archive is useful for this

1545
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:12,860
we couldn't find anything that was a

1546
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:14,510
slam-dunk we talked to the FTC we talked

1547
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:17,450
to some state AG's but we didn't get

1548
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:19,670
there with HP we are now building out

1549
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:21,259
some infrastructure a kind of Action

1550
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:22,400
Center that we can hold in the ready so

1551
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:24,080
the next time this comes up because

1552
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,060
there's just gonna be more of this we

1553
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:28,430
can give you a one-click to contact your

1554
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:30,590
state AG your local Better Business

1555
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:33,470
Bureau the FTC and your Congress member

1556
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:35,990
we also did get contacted by some

1557
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:38,870
class-action lawyers and we connected

1558
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:41,089
them with people who had contacted us so

1559
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:42,950
there is some class action in the offing

1560
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:44,780
I think in a lot of cases you're gonna

1561
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:47,299
see binding arbitration as a condition

1562
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:49,820
of using the device so even then you're

1563
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:51,470
gonna find very narrow remedies and

1564
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:53,420
again you know this takes place against

1565
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:57,259
this wider backdrop of increased

1566
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:59,030
corporate power and a legal system

1567
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:03,470
that's increasingly tilted towards

1568
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:04,970
incumbents and that means that a lot of

1569
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:06,980
the traditional remedies that we look

1570
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:09,890
for are not going to be available to us

1571
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:11,960
it's why we're going for this impact

1572
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:13,940
litigation to invalidate the statute as

1573
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,590
our first line even though it's such a

1574
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:17,270
long game I mean not as long as

1575
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:21,350
reforming it in Congress but it's still

1576
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:23,690
a very long game because the short game

1577
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:27,350
you know the product liability game is

1578
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:29,630
very hard to reach at this point we do

1579
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:31,970
think the class-action people are have a

1580
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:33,350
useful role to play there provided that

1581
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:35,089
there isn't binding arbitration and I

1582
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:36,759
think if they start scoring big wins I

1583
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:39,380
think you'll see binding arbitration

1584
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:42,920
universally rolled out for all of these

1585
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:45,470
products but I I agree with you that

1586
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,780
like the mere fact that the manufacturer

1587
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:50,620
hasn't has an advertised it for a

1588
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:53,540
specific purpose or that they haven't

1589
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:54,410
marked it off as prohibited or that you

1590
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:55,880
know they tell you not

1591
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:57,920
to use it in a certain way that

1592
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:59,480
shouldn't be decisive right like

1593
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,150
KitchenAid never told you you could mix

1594
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:04,190
paint in your paint mixer right and your

1595
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:06,020
in your kitchen mixer that doesn't mean

1596
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:07,819
that they should be able to like disable

1597
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:09,530
paint mixing like you know use a you

1598
01:02:07,819 --> 01:02:12,890
know integrate a mass spectrometer that

1599
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:15,530
disables paint mixing and then like make

1600
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:17,328
it a felony to disable that that mass

1601
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:19,730
spectrometer that's I mean that's not

1602
01:02:17,329 --> 01:02:21,410
really what the statute was crafted for

1603
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:25,039
although we did warn people that this

1604
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:26,899
would happen in 98 and you know it was a

1605
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:29,450
bipartisan madness unfortunately you

1606
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:30,890
know Bernie Frank there's a picture of

1607
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:32,899
him famous picture of him clinking a

1608
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:34,640
champagne glass with Jack Valenti

1609
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,930
on the eve but it was passed was the

1610
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:38,029
head of the Motion Picture Association

1611
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:40,129
guy who said that the VCR is the

1612
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:42,950
american film industry as the Boston

1613
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:44,539
Strangler is to a woman home alone so it

1614
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:47,960
really is a bipartisan madness

1615
01:02:44,539 --> 01:02:50,539
unfortunately we do think that there's

1616
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:52,910
like a strong argument to be made on

1617
01:02:50,539 --> 01:02:55,809
both sides of the floor for this I think

1618
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:59,000
that there's like a a property rights

1619
01:02:55,809 --> 01:03:01,400
argument to be made to people who are a

1620
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,730
free-market true believers and that

1621
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:06,829
there's also a personal dignity and an

1622
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:08,299
power imbalance where argument to be

1623
01:03:06,829 --> 01:03:11,510
made consumer protection right to be

1624
01:03:08,299 --> 01:03:13,579
made to to people on the democratic or

1625
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:17,859
left-wing side of the house so last

1626
01:03:13,579 --> 01:03:17,859
question go

1627
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:36,360
those there are companies that offer

1628
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:38,640
software bounties for bugs and I think

1629
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:40,290
that's great I mean you know the devil

1630
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,330
is in the details did the does it come

1631
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:43,890
with a gag order you know there are

1632
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:47,310
there are other there are other possible

1633
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:51,029
problems with it and I you know the way

1634
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:53,009
that I approach problem solving is how

1635
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:54,420
do we make things less worse I figure

1636
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:55,710
there are people who are domain experts

1637
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:57,270
and like how to make it better like

1638
01:03:55,710 --> 01:04:01,680
there are people who sit at the coalface

1639
01:03:57,270 --> 01:04:03,420
of fixing bugs in code people at you

1640
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,609
know on the chrome security team for

1641
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:08,100
example who sit there fixing bugs and

1642
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:10,620
they have intimate first-hand knowledge

1643
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:12,540
of the best way for them to receive bugs

1644
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:17,370
and they can order their affairs however

1645
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:21,050
they want to make it work well what I

1646
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:24,089
know is that it fails badly when you say

1647
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:27,630
companies whatever plan they have to

1648
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:29,460
make it work also get to dictate who can

1649
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:31,350
decide that that plan doesn't work for

1650
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:33,540
them right when they get to it when they

1651
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:36,299
get to exercise a veto over the

1652
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:39,480
disclosure of true facts that is not

1653
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:43,140
normally a feature of law for true facts

1654
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:44,970
to be in the for true facts to be only

1655
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:47,250
disclosable under under limited

1656
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:48,689
circumstances with some you know minor

1657
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,850
stuff around the edges around trade

1658
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:54,150
secrecy and so on and it's interesting

1659
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:55,520
because in the email that the world wide

1660
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:58,130
web consortium sent around this morning

1661
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:00,660
they said that Tim berners-lee was

1662
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:04,440
green-lighting a like a blue-ribbon

1663
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:06,390
panel to investigate best practices for

1664
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:08,100
security disclosures through a

1665
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:09,810
responsible channel which is to say

1666
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:14,460
under circumstances that companies agree

1667
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:16,890
with but not to say that it should be an

1668
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:18,960
absolute inalienable principle that true

1669
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:21,120
facts about security should be

1670
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,370
disclosable under any circumstances and

1671
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:25,290
that companies if they want to entice

1672
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:28,410
people to disclose under controlled

1673
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:30,240
circumstances should formulate those

1674
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:31,710
enticements against a backdrop where

1675
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:34,109
people can walk away from the offer

1676
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:36,030
right like if we want companies to

1677
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:38,850
formulate good offers for their bug

1678
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:42,240
bounties they can't say take it or leave

1679
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:44,339
it right there has to be against that

1680
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,000
offer from the company come to us and

1681
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,350
we'll give you X

1682
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,480
under dollars and promise that you can

1683
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:50,490
publish in six weeks there has to be the

1684
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,530
ability for you to say I don't like that

1685
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:54,629
deal I'm just gonna say I'm just gonna

1686
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:57,840
stand up on stage at Def Con and talk

1687
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:59,790
about it right uh if if the deal if the

1688
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:02,160
company is like do it our way or we put

1689
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:03,450
you in jail for five years then the

1690
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,850
companies get to craft some

1691
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:07,710
extraordinarily crappy deals and make

1692
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:10,140
them stick so if we want to make

1693
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:11,850
companies have good bug bounties we have

1694
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:14,790
to make the alternative to bug bounties

1695
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:17,250
good as well right non risky as well we

1696
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:21,990
need graceful failure modes to underpin

1697
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:26,250
our our well-crafted success modes thank

1698
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:26,600
you all very much thank you for having

1699
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:30,250
me

1700
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,250
[Applause]
