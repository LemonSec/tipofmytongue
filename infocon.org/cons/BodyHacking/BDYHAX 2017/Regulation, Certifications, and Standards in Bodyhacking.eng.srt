1
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,209
good afternoon everyone thank you for

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,290
come

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:17,210
to the panel we're going to be talking

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:20,710
about regulations certifications and

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:23,810
standards in bio and body hacking i mean

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:26,390
body hacking related products and

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,738
services they are very steadily entering

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,050
into the market more and more of us are

9
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:32,840
partaking in that and it's often a step

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:35,140
or two ahead of the regulatory regimes

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,160
that are you know designed and set up to

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,550
ensure that these things are of course

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,099
effective and safe so our objective at

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,980
the time that we have today there's

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,449
going to think through some of these

16
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,419
particular issues when it comes to both

17
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:52,730
monitoring and modifying our minds and

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,480
our bodies and how these powerful tools

19
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:59,660
should indeed be regulated certified and

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,809
standardized so with us today we've got

21
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:05,300
a another excellent panel jake Dunnigan

23
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,460
governance designer and a teacher he is

24
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,370

massive revolution at the intersection

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,430
of digital health genomics and things we

47
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,079
consume he holds to be asked with honors

48
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:06,920
and distinction in computer science from

49
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:09,288
Stanford University and we have a mall

50
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,690
graph stray from dangerous things he's

51
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:13,609
always had an interest in technology

52
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:16,130
it's got two small RFID transponders

53
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,680
implanted into each hand and he uses

54
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,359
them to open doors start vehicles log on

55
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,370
to his computer and since I'm planting

56
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,090
himself he's written a book called RFID

57
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,430
toys he's done TEDx

58
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,569
he's appeared on a number of TV programs

59
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,730
that he's been the subject of various

60
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:32,950
documentaries his company dangerous

61
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,799
things developed the world's first and

62
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,959
only NFC compliant implantable

63
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,420
transponder we're gonna start with them

64
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:44,769
all today I'm gonna ask you a question

65
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:46,869
you know even the name itself body

66
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:48,940
hacking you know what kind of has this

67
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,730
kind of connotation to it and and I

68
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,709
think there is maybe this impression not

69
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,510
not amongst those of us who are involved

70
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:57,370
in this community but perhaps those that

71
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,959
are still you know learning about it

72
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,090
discovering about it that there might be

73
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,280
this kind of association with your

74
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,709
basement hacks slicing themselves up

75
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,680
doing all manner of bondable things to

76
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:10,450
themselves would you say that's a fair

77
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,620
characterization I guess I know how

78
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,810
you're gonna answer the question but I

79
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,040
guess when ways might that be a fair

80
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,829
characterization let's start let's start

81
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,420
with that yeah so I would say that the

82
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:22,239
the first issue is with the word hacking

83
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,950
and there's there's two ways to look at

84
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,390
it right the the first negative

85
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,548
conversation is that it's something that

86
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,828
somebody's doing this nefarious right

87
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:32,079
you're hacking into a computer system or

88
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:33,730
whatever the the other thing is

89
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:36,430
literally hacking like with a hatchet

90
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,230
right so you get this image of you know

91
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,780
there's people doing negative nefarious

92
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,388
things with hatchets like it's it's it's

93
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,280
built into the word right so the reality

94
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,600
is that you know my definition of

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,190
hacking is that it's an unconventional

96
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,829
approach to solving a problem or

97
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,900
attaining a goal and a good hack is

98
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:56,079
efficient hack it becomes conventional

99
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:59,470
so right now we're all of this kind of

100
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:02,380
very nascent early stage you know

101
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,230
citizen science era of approaching

102
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:07,299
problems that usually are the ivory

103
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,060
towers of you know University and

104
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:12,099
government study so we're at a point now

105
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,989
where we can actually do these things I

106
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:16,779
mean I I built a prototype implantable

107
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:19,000
transponder in my garage it's safe with

108
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,039
safe materials and it's totally possible

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,139
to do that now and it's you know whereas

110
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:25,659
before it would be you know what is this

111
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:27,760
crazy guy doing so I don't blame the

112
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,800
public for for kind of getting this

113
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,110
negative view that it's it's a bunch of

114
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,810
dirty grinders and working in garages

115
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,250
and doing these weird things but but

116
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,930
this that's kind of the beginning of

117
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,289
anything right like the Wright brothers

118
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,270
were in

119
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:42,550
garage work on this thing and everybody

120
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,740
thought they were nuts and and it comes

121
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,119
out so that's why things like body

122
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,009
hacking Connor so important is that

123
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,180
we're normalizing it we're getting it

124
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:51,369
out and saying we're not just in that

125
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,559
balls where this is a thing where we're

126
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:55,059
doing a thing here right I'm Jeff your

127
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:57,550
background excuse me mm-hmm

128
00:04:55,059 --> 00:05:00,159
a little bit different I think of things

129
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,949
like the trophic sand those sorts of

130
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:04,149
hacks I mean does that have a similar I

131
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:05,409
think negative connotation and people

132
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:06,819
are just kind of in a way just drugging

133
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:09,099
themselves in a different sort of a way

134
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:10,930
yeah no I think I'm all had a good

135
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:13,389
characterization around the word hacking

136
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,949
I think it's a hundred spot-on I think

137
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:16,419
when we think it but in our community

138
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:18,849
it's very much like creative solutions

139
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:22,719
brought a community in the farías guy in

140
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:26,409
a hoodie like breaking the law yeah I

141
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:28,569
think in in a nootropic space especially

142
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:30,459
when there's as it's the broad umbrella

143
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:33,129
term across all types of substances

144
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:37,029
scheduled research chemicals things that

145
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:39,009
are generally regarded as safe the

146
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:41,529
regulation is interesting because it's

147
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:43,990
very much orthogonal to efficacy right

148
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:46,180
if we looked at for aliens looking at

149
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,309
the world of compounds you know things

150
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,199
like alcohol would be very high in terms

151
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:52,689
of like social and personal damage where

152
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:56,439
other compounds that are scheduled one M

153
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:57,729
game a other things are much safer on

154
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,969
that level so it's like very interesting

155
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:03,849
from a regulatory perspective but I

156
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:05,080
think that I think all of us here would

157
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:06,938
agree that you don't stop him in

158
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,209
progress it's about doing it responsibly

159
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:11,860
and we've just seen in Silicon Valley

160
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:14,559
where people are valuing productivity

161
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:17,680
enhancing their cognition that more and

162
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:19,599
more professional type people are

163
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,379
entering you know BAU Hawking has a way

164
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:27,308
to do it enhance their economic value

165
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:30,939
and I think once this community goes

166
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:33,719
from sort of hobbyist you know art

167
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:36,399
projects in some sense on themselves and

168
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:38,949
transitions more and more into hey we

169
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:42,729
can actually add value to society in a

170
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:45,599
way that's not that that's that's not

171
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:48,068
that hasn't been done possible before

172
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:49,389
that's when we start seeing hey this is

173
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:51,560
actually some real interesting

174
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:53,360
technology that's being developed

175
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,190
that's I think that that's a tipping

176
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,810
point where this goes from niche to hey

177
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:00,770
this is like what humanities might look

178
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:02,890
like coming future Victoria hmm you've

179
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,570
done work obviously and when it comes to

180
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,800
security he worked on you know these

181
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,530
sorts of councils that are that that

182
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,880
that have these concerns I mean it

183
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,080
sounds pretty scary though like that you

184
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,880
know you have these I guess rogue

185
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,830
individuals you know doing odd

186
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,810
experiments in the basement I mean I

187
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:20,599
thought I had that particular level of I

188
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,860
guess some concern I mean what were some

189
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,260
what are some thoughts that you have on

190
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,830
that on this particular community yes I

191
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:31,820
think when this this issue comes up with

192
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:35,390
doing yourself i ology DIY bio I want to

193
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:37,820
stress that that's that that's something

194
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:40,039
that we want to allow to happen we don't

195
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:43,310
want to and fairly burden that that's

196
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:45,410
freedom and citizen science if you're an

197
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:48,669
originalist in the Constitution you'll

198
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:51,620
look at Thomas Jefferson who was a

199
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:53,840
certainly a citizen scientist who

200
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,610
experimented with everything and if you

201
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,729
had Thomas Jefferson here today which is

202
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,979
an originalist analysis Thomas Jefferson

203
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:02,659
would say go for it

204
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:05,090
that's good and in fact you shouldn't

205
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,760
even have government intervention unless

206
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,929
there's a risk to the public and only

207
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,780
then you should have a government

208
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,760
intranets the role of government and so

209
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,140
yes there are some dangerous things that

210
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,050
can happen so when does government

211
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:21,080
intervene when when do we think there's

212
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,030
something bad going on well if there's

213
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,520
an incident then the tort system picks

214
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:28,039
it up that is there may be some lawsuit

215
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,039
for for malpractice if someone is

216
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,659
damaged but until there's some

217
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,419
widespread indication that the

218
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:38,088
government should intervene with a rule

219
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:41,329
which affects everyone government really

220
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:43,250
shouldn't be intervening so the

221
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,930
dangerous things that can be done they

222
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:49,010
interestingly there is really very

223
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:53,030
little government intervention and DIY

224
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:54,710
bio for example it is you you have to be

225
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,260
very concerned about why you ship

226
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:59,150
through the through the mail because

227
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:02,030
they've had once adipex enters say

228
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:04,459
commerce then you've crossed into a lot

229
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,180
of federal law but as long as you're

230
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:07,010
staying too

231
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:11,540
sailfin not affecting anybody else

232
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:14,480
you're probably okay so I think in

233
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:18,650
similar ways if you look at that as

234
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,870
analogy as long as you aren't and

235
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,100
engaged in interstate commerce but as

236
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,320
soon as you're on the internet you're

237
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,170
engaged in interstate commerce so you

238
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,050
have to be aware of that but otherwise

239
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:33,199
no government intervention until

240
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:36,050
something typically happens once in a

241
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,420
while Congress will get a lots of well

242
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,969
here and if it's a high-profile issue

243
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:43,099
and then they will go to the agencies

244
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,320
and say why don't you know more about

245
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,480
this and then that kind of goes the

246
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,960
agencies into doing something but as

247
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,030
long as you don't attract unwarranted

248
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,340
negative attention to Congress you're

249
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,079
probably okay too right

250
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,940
Jake I'm hoping you can you can kind of

251
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,000
pick you back off what Victoria said

252
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,150
there in what way is this kind of I

253
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,470
guess leniency if you will or

254
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:08,660
permissiveness a positive thing and what

255
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,280
we kind of like I suppose create both a

256
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,270
foster both innovation and creativity

257
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:17,630
yeah I think just bouncing for the hacks

258
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:18,800
part first of all you know I'm friends

259
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,750
with a lot of switched-on people and

260
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,250
even so if you put body and hacking

261
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,170
together it immediately

262
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:27,290
you know expert or comes to mind so

263
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:28,610
there's a little bit of a metaphorical

264
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:32,329
resonance that we need to acknowledge

265
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:35,990
when we do this and another point just

266
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:37,550
before I go into the question is you

267
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,280
know I'm just very happy to be here with

268
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:43,010
you all in this room I live in Austin

269
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,260
and and welcome you here also because

270
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,300
you guys are making the future and one

271
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,980
of my favorite quotes is from Alfred

272
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,349
North Whitehead says it's the business

273
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,610
of the future to be dangerous and I

274
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,560
think if we think about what's going on

275
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,110
in our world not to get blinded by the

276
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,640
present but know that we're here to to

277
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,960
do some things that shake things up and

278
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,449
there may be some opportunities and

279
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,490
cracks in the edifice for us to imagine

280
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,900
more broadly and have the chance to

281
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,690
actually make those things happen so

282
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,010
keeping our eye on the future well you

283
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,900
deal with the issues of the present is

284
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,130
very important and I think all of these

285
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,280
issues we're going to talk about now are

286
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:18,710
relevant to that I think for the term

287
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,870
hacking and how we approach it

288
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,510
and this DIY thing I think it's it's

289
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:26,000
it's it's okay it's somewhat accurate

290
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:28,130
but incomplete I did my work a lot of

291
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,110
work on neuro politics and I was looking

292
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,630
at how our understanding of the brain

293
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,180
and and mind in our ability to modulate

294
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,459
that is going to have new political

295
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,029
impacts and social impacts and one of

296
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:43,189
the key pieces insights that I had while

297
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:44,689
doing that work is that most of the time

298
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,300
you talk about that you think of things

299
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,730
going into the brain implants or our

300
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,949
MRIs or things that that image and kind

301
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:54,380
of go inside but I was just as concerned

302
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:56,480
with things going out from our minds so

303
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,790
the extended mind idea so so me in this

304
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,550
notebook is as a cognitive ecology and

305
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:04,209
that has a has a logic and a politics to

306
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:09,140
it me and my phone a different set of

307
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:11,079
rules norms licenses things that are

308
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,580
sort of won over that so thinking about

309
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,920
do-it-yourself bio and bio hacking as a

310
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,140
system and what's involved and who has

311
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,079
claims on what we do and do you want

312
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:23,330
government a light hand or do you want a

313
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,980
heavy hand or do we want to trust the

314
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:28,120
makers of these things Cory Doctorow

315
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,500
yesterday talked about all of the the IP

316
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,850
thickets that are tied to machines and

317
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,589
the data that we get you know how we

318
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,420
interfacing with that but thinking about

319
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:38,390
ourselves not just in here but the

320
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:40,189
system that we extend ourselves to is

321
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:42,170
very important to that and then another

322
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:44,060
I'll make another call out for a similar

323
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,339
idea from your colleague Jay Hughes

324
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,630
about moral enhancement and we think

325
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:49,910
about body hacking it tends to be very

326
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:52,610
physical and and sometimes either you

327
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:54,860
know I mean neurological or genetic but

328
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,779
also very molar and kind of physical in

329
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,670
a way but what about these other issues

330
00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:00,350
what about moral enhancement is that is

331
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,270
that hacking or you know virtue

332
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,130
engineering also called it you know do

333
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:06,680
we do we expand that so I'll make a case

334
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:10,029
for expanding our notion of what body

335
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,650
hacking is and then we can take on the

336
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:14,540
the rights regimes and the political

337
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,800
imports of all of the things that exist

338
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,160
in that system I think that's a helpful

339
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:22,339
to me it's a helpful frame

340
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,199
Jeff a big question but an important

341
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:25,459
question and that is and I think we all

342
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,860
really need to be asking ourselves this

343
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:29,329
is who's really benefiting from

344
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,089
biohacking

345
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:34,248
I think at the start right people are

346
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:36,860
doing this to enhance themselves all

347
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:39,350
fundamentally right I think I think one

348
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:43,399
of the unique parts of our species is

349
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:45,110
that we want to manipulate ourselves in

350
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:46,579
our environment in bacon and butter lace

351
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,579
right like we're the only species that's

352
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:52,878
really dominating such a way across our

353
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:58,729
environment and I think so I think it

354
00:13:52,879 --> 00:14:01,879
starts from ourselves one but then to I

355
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:04,100
think and I like what you're saying Jake

356
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:05,869
around sort of those like broader

357
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,089
political social political movement I

358
00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:10,790
think that if you look at broader health

359
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:12,290
care whether you can talk about like

360
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,429
Obamacare where's the potential Trump

361
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,549
care

362
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:19,999
I really see biohacking as as a populist

363
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:22,429
movement within within health or a lot

364
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:25,040
of ways empowering ourselves with the

365
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:28,790
know-how the sensors the devices in the

366
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,399
community and the social proof to be in

367
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:36,459
to be taking those decisions away from

368
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:38,869
big insurance big pharmaceutical and

369
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:41,809
these big corporate interests so I think

370
00:14:38,869 --> 00:14:42,739
in the short term our selves but the

371
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:44,269
long term we could really just

372
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:45,949
reengineer how we even think about

373
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:47,929
healthcare and I think it's a system

374
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:50,299
that's clearly broken if you look at the

375
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:54,619
trends for metabolic syndromes diabetes

376
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:56,569
Alzheimer's obesity just like up into

377
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:59,839
the right like I think one crazy said I

378
00:14:56,569 --> 00:15:02,599
saw recently was by 2050 the CDC

379
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,059
predicts that 75 percent of us will be

380
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,759
overweight or obese which is insane I

381
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:10,129
mean we're already like the sickest

382
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:10,970
cohort of humanity in the history of

383
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:14,660
humans

384
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:16,160
I like cavemen early medieval people

385
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:21,189
were healthier than us in a lot of ways

386
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:23,629
so the current system is unsustainable I

387
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:25,879
you know I would love to see this

388
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:27,410
community us be that seed of just

389
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:30,679
changing how we think about healthcare

390
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:32,749
board asking the same question who's

391
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:36,499
ultimately benefiting from these sorts

392
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:38,179
of augmentations well I like I would

393
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:40,620
like to think that a society and that

394
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:44,069
we're actually enhancing our

395
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:46,350
quality of living and otherwise why else

396
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:48,900
would we do it and I think we're doing

397
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:52,350
there we're maximizing that while trying

398
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:54,060
to balance the risk and to do that as

399
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,280
quickly as we can

400
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,339
I think that's that's what I see going

401
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,780
on right I'm all I mean our big business

402
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,730
is really the ones that are benefiting

403
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,439
the most from this and are they maybe

404
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:06,000
through future products just kind of

405
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,350
duping people into convincing them of

406
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,230
things they don't necessarily need or

407
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,400
want mmm well I think that anybody who's

408
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,670
on the forefront of something like this

409
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:17,370
they are they're piercing the veil of

410
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:19,620
that and what happens is you know you

411
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,630
wouldn't argue that having a desktop

412
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,340
printers is bad for society and it's

413
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,770
just for the big companies but the

414
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,000
problems of printer is old and so these

415
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,630
company like Cori was talking about

416
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,960
yesterday

417
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:33,270
HP's trying to now squeeze more you know

418
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,320
juice out of that lemon and so the the

419
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,210
problem comes in when there's not

420
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,100
innovation when there's like how do we

421
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,600
forget about innovation just try to

422
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,400
squeeze more dollars right and that

423
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,280
happens with older products things that

424
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,829
are you know ubiquitous and you know

425
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,810
commodity so you know what we're doing

426
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:50,250
is you know we're on the forefront of

427
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,380
doing this when it ultimately starts

428
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,450
with with ourselves we you know

429
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,310
experiment with ourselves and and other

430
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,290
people like minded people but but

431
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:01,109
ultimately if that idea catches hold and

432
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:03,630
it has value and efficacy then it will

433
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:05,550
spread and society ultimately benefits

434
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,500
from that then yes you will have people

435
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:10,399
come on and try to exploit that that's

436
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,349
that's common but yeah not really

437
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,170
overall you know the benefit is

438
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:17,790
society's I mean I think if dangerous

439
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,920
things are neutral box end up being big

440
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:22,050
companies and we stop innovating I hope

441
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:29,280
the younger versions of ourselves kill

442
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:32,129
us right I think I love the idea that

443
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,570
we're the sickest generation in human

444
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,660
history maybe we're also the smartest

445
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,649
what a combo right what a challenge or

446
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,260
dilemma that we're gonna have to be

447
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:42,840
facing one of the one of the dynamics of

448
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,640
our systems I think and I'll just make a

449
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,409
stab to see if it applies here to think

450
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,190
through with it is at least in our

451
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:53,700
economy the way it's designed now we

452
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:55,620
socialize risk and privatize profit and

453
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,990
a system that in this case when we're

454
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,209
experimenting can we make sure that the

455
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,070
benefits of these experiments also go to

456
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,720
the society that's taking the risk on if

457
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,610
their failed experiments if people are

458
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,740
left debilitated or if they're issues

459
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,928
that come up we we tend to bear those

460
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,360
risk ourselves so I would want to make

461
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:14,279
sure one that the users have control

462
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,279
again echo and Cory yesterday as much as

463
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:20,789
we can but also find a way to design the

464
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:22,919
system where that cycle is this fair as

465
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:25,080
we as we experiment and go forward so

466
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,700
just really quickly I have a this is a

467
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,850
weird common argument actually it was

468
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,549
happening because the argument is okay

469
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,168
open-source is great right and and Cory

470
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:37,408
is very much for its open a free

471
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:39,779
software but does society ultimately

472
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:42,179
benefit if that goes nowhere mmm right

473
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:43,799
so Microsoft evil corporation with

474
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,149
private closed stuff but it's everywhere

475
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:47,399
and we're using computers and it's great

476
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:50,330
so and the same for Apple I mean this is

477
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:52,860
the argument of you know closed is is

478
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:55,260
you know not very beneficial for the

479
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,820
individual but society seems to benefit

480
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,370
greatly because these profit models

481
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,678
drive adoption right and yes there might

482
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,260
be better things but because they're not

483
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,419
adopted mmm-hmm it's a it's like VHS

484
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,820
Betamax baby max is better but it wasn't

485
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:11,940
adopted so I never see that and yeah is

486
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:14,629
that does that make it better yeah Jake

487
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:19,230
another big question and that is

488
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:21,480
ultimately you know why this emphasis or

489
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,490
this concern with regulation I mean

490
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,019
there is a school thought - a minority

491
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,399
school of thought that is this kind of a

492
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:28,440
libertarian approach you know keep your

493
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:31,080
hands off my body I can do to myself you

494
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,760
know what I want to do to myself and you

495
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,139
know that's my that's my problem what's

496
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,049
wrong with what's wrong with that

497
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:40,019
attitude or that approach I I think it's

498
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:43,918
okay until it's not so until we have to

499
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:47,779
bear the social weight I mean you know

500
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,779
non productive members of society or

501
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,260
extracting resources that could be going

502
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:53,549
to something else I mean I'm pretty much

503
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,010
on the side for individuals to

504
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:58,799
experiment as much as you want but also

505
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:00,210
there has to be a way I mean maybe I'm

506
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,549
being exaggerating but failed

507
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,350
experiments that leave people or groups

508
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:07,200
of people debilitated or or unleash

509
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:09,120
things that we can't really control then

510
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,380
becomes a problem so I think if there's

511
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:15,299
a way to for us to see total freedom

512
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,250
until we find out where those borders

513
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:20,399
are that we need to take an account of

514
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,990
but not I mean we need to to be aware of

515
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:23,699
this and as a futurist you want to take

516
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,950
the second third fourth level

517
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,929
implications into mind as you as you

518
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,669
think about these things and not get and

519
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:33,809
not always be reacting to them but I

520
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:35,820
think we we take a I would default to

521
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:37,980
let's let's see how these things go

522
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:41,668
before we intervene too soon

523
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:44,580
Victoria I mean do you feel that the

524
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:46,740
state needs to you know intervene in a

525
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,149
way to protect people from themselves is

526
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,309
that when wave is that a fair

527
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:51,928
characterization well that's it that is

528
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:55,139
the role of government to intervene if

529
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:57,000
you need to do that I think in in the

530
00:20:55,139 --> 00:20:59,070
the course of emerging technologies

531
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,929
there's that balance where government

532
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:03,120
shouldn't get involved while it's still

533
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:05,070
developing and I think we are certainly

534
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,439
at that stage with all of these

535
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:10,168
technologies and government needs to

536
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,169
keep an eye on it to be involved but to

537
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:15,120
step aside while otherwise you're going

538
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:16,950
to stifle the technology and it's never

539
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,459
going to be able to realize what it can

540
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:23,450
actually do so fortunately we've matured

541
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:26,789
to that level where government is aware

542
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:29,580
that that they should not intervene when

543
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:31,110
we when the technology is emerging and

544
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,789
also when you have new areas like that

545
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:34,168
they may not have the authority yet so

546
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:35,639
you might have to wait on Congress to do

547
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,269
something and we know how long that

548
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:39,449
might be

549
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:42,630
so that gives you some room to develop

550
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:46,019
the emerging technology before you get

551
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:48,029
government intervention also the

552
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:49,260
intervention the first time we bump up

553
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:51,179
against these things often is in the

554
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,190
courts in the legislative branch or the

555
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:55,769
tort system yeah we come up with a case

556
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:58,889
first of my dish iary branch as a as a

557
00:21:55,769 --> 00:22:00,210
place where this kind of where this kind

558
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:02,158
of thinking happens is happen it's

559
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:04,440
probably the first line way before

560
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,750
legislative branch has anything to do

561
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,519
with it yep often the tort system is the

562
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,440
first place that you deal with this for

563
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:14,039
someone has a malpractice case or

564
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,720
something and then that becomes an okay

565
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:17,519
said someone who will testify to

566
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,230
Congress and say this is the sort of

567
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,120
thing we need to protect people from

568
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:24,150
there's also enough

569
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,040
area that I think it may be the first

570
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,180
line where we might have government men

571
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,700
intervention and that is the

572
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:33,240
professionals who are doing the work of

573
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,430
inserting or assembling or putting in

574
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,950
the devices with the human interface

575
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:40,650
anytime you have human contact with a

576
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:43,470
professional the state-level wants to

577
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:49,080
regulate it or local government like

578
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:51,120
tattoo artists were your piercing those

579
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,620
are lightly regulated but there is some

580
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,770
regulation and it varies from

581
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:57,479
jurisdiction to jurisdiction so I think

582
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,700
the best thing to do is to try to get

583
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,530
ahead of that and to develop your own

584
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,230
code of ethics for that group of

585
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:07,620
professionals and have maybe a guild

586
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:09,330
already in place and that also helps to

587
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,520
to light government intervention because

588
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:14,460
if it looks as if the profession is

589
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,820
regulating itself they tend to stay back

590
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:24,170
like in the nanotechnology area they

591
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:26,399
stayed back in the distribution of

592
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:28,050
actually use synthetic biology as a

593
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,230
better example where they stayed back

594
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:34,559
because this in bio people work managing

595
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:36,900
themselves very well so in the same the

596
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,160
same idea if you manage yourselves very

597
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,140
well with your own code of ethics

598
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,520
they'll leave you alone because they

599
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,390
feel like you're regulating yourself

600
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,760
well and until something happens that

601
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:49,920
system sometimes works well to Jeff or

602
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,559
the work that you do and I would say VIN

603
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,150
that your particular market niche in

604
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,550
what ways would you say that regulation

605
00:23:54,150 --> 00:24:02,070
is both positive and negative

606
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:04,620
yeah I think regulation like we're gonna

607
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:06,178
be running into it I think if we imagine

608
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:09,389
that this is gonna be a mainstream

609
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:11,340
activity with reasonable businesses in

610
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:13,350
there it's sooner or later that we'll

611
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,360
have to you know be regulated by the

612
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:17,219
government so the way I think about it

613
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,169
is that obviously biohacking

614
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,960
body-hugging brought so many different

615
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:23,580
categories the way I like to think about

616
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,610
it is thinking about it in a couple

617
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:29,040
different degrees what I call second

618
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:30,928
degree is things that exploit our

619
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,210
existing input or output channel so some

620
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:34,950
examples we have our different senses we

621
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:39,240
have different like dietary

622
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:41,160
at the track we can absorb compounds you

623
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,020
can he's like binaural beats - you know

624
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:46,520
that shift your mood different like

625
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:50,010
lights or you know sleep treatment etc

626
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:52,020
first degree is adding new channels of

627
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:53,280
input or output into our system so I

628
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,830
think stuff that I'm all might be

629
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,200
working on is adding like a new organ or

630
00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:01,189
a new capability on on our human bodies

631
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:06,810
and then 0th degree which is editing our

632
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:10,140
innate fabric just for example biology

633
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:13,290
is essentially constrained by chemical

634
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:16,230
signals what if the input output of

635
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:17,850
human bodies was the speed of light

636
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,730
whatever the digital creatures right so

637
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:24,360
I think from there you have different

638
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:28,080
sort of I guess intimacy's of biohacking

639
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:30,659
right so I think at a high level an

640
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,710
individual basis I'm super libertarian

641
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,500
you can do whatever the hell you want to

642
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:36,360
your body you want to like go for it

643
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,160
right there's no societal harm there but

644
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,990
I think you're running a business and I

645
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,490
think if you're starting to enter you

646
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:44,970
know first reserve degree type

647
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:48,240
enhancements you're you're touching like

648
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:50,100
pretty core parts of people's health

649
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,670
right and if there is a body of

650
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:55,230
regulation around medical devices you

651
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:57,210
know making medical claims all that

652
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:59,300
stuff went in some secondary things such

653
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,590
that as well there's a body of law there

654
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:06,840
and then there's a consumer devices like

655
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:08,669
iPhones and things right so it's it

656
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,679
feels like to me that but enhancements

657
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:12,750
bio hacks sits somewhere in that middle

658
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,340
we we shouldn't like regulate these

659
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,770
things like an iPhone or I watch right

660
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:21,060
like if I chop off your arm and give you

661
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:23,160
robot arm that's you know not medicine

662
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:25,050
anymore because medicine is defined as

663
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,390
treatment diagnosis and prevention

664
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,680
disease so I'm not doing that I'm

665
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:32,880
clearly not just selling an iPhone

666
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:36,440
either so I think what Victoria brought

667
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,090
up is is right we should have these

668
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,390
moral ethical regulatory like

669
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:45,209
discussions now as a community as a

670
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:47,820
coalition and then once these end up

671
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,860
being realities we have a unified front

672
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,439
when this go

673
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:53,449
the Congress when this goes to

674
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,130
legislatures right I see like organic

675
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,580
food movement started very much like

676
00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:01,100
that where organic food labeling was the

677
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:04,250
industry consortium of farmers that

678
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,959
define higher farming practices and that

679
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:08,210
over ten years twenty years ended up

680
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,650
being a federal like Jared like federal

681
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,660
Department essentially around or growing

682
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:14,929
food so I see a similar path happening

683
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:16,880
here so um on that note I mean um could

684
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:19,820
it be said for example that if suddenly

685
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,650
your your thing is regulated that you

686
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,110
kind of made it like you could it's a

687
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:25,160
legitimizing horse where's my where's in

688
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,389
the past you might have fought at now

689
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,370
you're like oh yeah like we are we are

690
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:31,580
now like regulated we are a thing we are

691
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:33,909
a legitimate well the the the concept is

692
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,600
always that regulation is inevitable and

693
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:37,280
that's not always the case

694
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,959
I mean body jewelry isn't regulated that

695
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,330
way right and I think that the

696
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,080
presumption that the FDA is there to

697
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:47,659
control every aspect of life is is

698
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,970
inaccurate so the reason they stay very

699
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,919
clearly defined medical devices and they

700
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,140
don't want to regulate elective

701
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,850
procedures things like that they've

702
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,919
defined something they feel is of risk

703
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:00,770
to the public right but but they're

704
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:03,290
leaving as this huge swath open on

705
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:04,879
purpose to allow freedom and to allow

706
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:07,940
into innovation and technological

707
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,940
development so like just saying like

708
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,990
yeah we're regulated now that's that's

709
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,549
it means you've just entered into that

710
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,500
zone it doesn't mean that you're any

711
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:17,600
more or less legitimate although people

712
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,760
believe that so we are asked all the

713
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,980
time is your is your implant

714
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,200
fda-approved because they assume that

715
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,610
means it's safe but it's not really the

716
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,860
case I mean you do your own case study

717
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:29,299
work you do your own you know stuff and

718
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,760
you present it to the FDA and then they

719
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:32,990
either decide or whatever but but

720
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,970
there's it's not a guarantee that it's

721
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:36,590
safe it's just a guarantee that they've

722
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:39,440
deemed that you've done some research

723
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:41,030
and sure yeah we hope it's good but

724
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,040
there's plenty of fda-approved devices

725
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:45,590
that about kill their patients right

726
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,389
like so the reality is we could have

727
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,070
opted to get FDA approval but that would

728
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,780
totally mess up our body piercing

729
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:53,379
partnerships because piercers are

730
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:56,620
regulated to not use medical devices so

731
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:59,929
so we opted not to so it's it's viewed

732
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:02,039
in most jurisdictions as novelty body

733
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:03,299
jewelry

734
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,919
I want to talk a little bit about

735
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:08,250
quality management systems because it's

736
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:11,549
not always just about you know what they

737
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:13,559
do I mean these things like ISO

738
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:15,509
standards and so on I mean that's

739
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,860
clearly speaks to what we're doing here

740
00:29:15,509 --> 00:29:18,210
we bought it with by Mac and written

741
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,158
that they will get involved in this

742
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,659
should they be involved and creating

743
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,830
these sorts of standards like I'm just I

744
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,509
guess trying to imagine some of the

745
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,039
benefits of getting that kind of level

746
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:28,080
of giving certification

747
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:29,970
yeah absolutely I think ISO is a good

748
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,220
place to start because of course has an

749
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:34,559
international standard and so everyone

750
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:38,309
will be able to plug in use the same

751
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,600
part had the same terminology and you

752
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:41,850
actually have people from the industry

753
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,529
together to set those standards some

754
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:45,658
people think that's the box watching the

755
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:47,399
chicken house but I think it's the way

756
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,110
to make sure it's right

757
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:51,689
you don't want regulators who've never

758
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:53,758
done this before to come up with ideas

759
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,200
that make no sense so this is a good

760
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,720
place to start especially in a very

761
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,580
specialized industry where only the

762
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,440
people in it really understand it and

763
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,418
then they set their own standards and

764
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,879
then regulators can adopt those

765
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:09,059
standards by reference and then you can

766
00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:11,189
refer to them and stand use the

767
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:13,019
regulation so you go again that's the

768
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:15,570
way of getting ahead of the curve with

769
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:17,220
regulation is to set an ISO standard I

770
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:21,269
think that's good

771
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:23,820
NIST sensor representatives all by our

772
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:26,700
agency news sends representatives died

773
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,259
so as well as having just the private

774
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,240
sector involved in setting those

775
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:33,389
standards so yes I think that's an

776
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,639
excellent way to make sure that that you

777
00:30:33,389 --> 00:30:38,490
have a say in health and what direction

778
00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:40,740
this industry is going right would you

779
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:43,470
share those okay yeah I mean I think

780
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:47,190
having knowledge of what you're actually

781
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:49,169
working on yeah but also at some level

782
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:51,570
independence so I think there is a point

783
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:54,029
where there needs to be some kind of

784
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,950
oversight that understands what's going

785
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:57,960
on but I'll also scan see you know I was

786
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:00,299
mentioning the second third level impact

787
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,909
so I love things like the Ministry of

788
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:04,350
the future in Sweden you know I mean we

789
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:06,629
used to have a office of Technology

790
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:10,139
Assessment I think these kind of big

791
00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:12,090
picture research groups or people that

792
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:14,879
are committed to looking at what are the

793
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:18,030
future impacts of these things

794
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,930
have some say in that when it's time to

795
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:24,660
act on it but you know responding to the

796
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:28,710
standards that the industry has but also

797
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:30,810
having political and other kinds of

798
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:32,730
Independence economic independence from

799
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:34,830
what's going on so I mean a layered

800
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:38,700
approach I think would be most

801
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:40,830
beneficial um Jeff's gonna ask you start

802
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,240
with this next question and you know as

803
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:45,149
I'm sure you're probably all too aware

804
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,300
there are a good number of fake products

805
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:50,430
I would say on the market or at least my

806
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:53,520
products they don't don't necessarily do

807
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:56,250
what's advertised right and you know

808
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,410
pills that extend life there is even

809
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,820
though there are a plethora of pills out

810
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:01,410
there that claim to do exactly that

811
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,790
there isn't a single pill in the market

812
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,950
that can be actually be claimed to be a

813
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:06,840
you know extend actually extend life

814
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,220
there's one example or in a true

815
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,510
triggering weight-loss boosting

816
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,680
intelligence other cognitive the

817
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,060
cognitive skills that may or may not

818
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,110
work you know again to the may be the

819
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,240
degree that they're that they're being

820
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:17,429
advertised but my question is I how do

821
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,620
we pretend not talking but level the

822
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:21,540
consumer now how do we protect the

823
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,989
consumer from this stuff and even maybe

824
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:28,920
educate them about you know in ways that

825
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:32,160
they might be getting duped yeah I think

826
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,810
that's a very good question right so I

827
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,090
think the regulation is already in place

828
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:38,520
with FTC Federal Trade Commission around

829
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:40,830
you can't make crazy claims without

830
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:45,389
justification I think the problem is

831
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:47,689
enforcement it's very easy for now the

832
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:51,330
internet have an e-commerce startup cell

833
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:52,920
you know life extension pills right like

834
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:54,899
the government doesn't have agents

835
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:59,310
crawling over every word just shutting

836
00:32:54,900 --> 00:33:02,480
down every possible movement so I think

837
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:05,129
practically I don't think we even I

838
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,810
think the direction is not to just like

839
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:10,410
fund more and more people tracking on

840
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:13,830
people I think practically what people

841
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:16,320
should be doing is looking at companies

842
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:18,780
that actually open source and do

843
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,750
clinical clinical trials on their

844
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:23,879
products yeah so that's something that

845
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:25,680
we do at neutral box we actually run our

846
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,420
own clinical trials with different

847
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,710
partner universities so you can actually

848
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:32,009
go to clinical trials

849
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:33,869
see the products or clinical trials so I

850
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:37,320
think with a lot of more and more

851
00:33:33,869 --> 00:33:41,850
functional claimed products we should in

852
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:46,710
some level ask these companies these

853
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:49,769
brands to reach like half pharmaceutical

854
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:53,999
level rigor right run randomized

855
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:58,860
controlled trials against placebo and I

856
00:33:53,999 --> 00:34:00,299
think that that might be you know and I

857
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:03,029
think like again the regulation is

858
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:05,190
they're just not enforced equally I

859
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:07,799
think it's hard to be like hey

860
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:09,510
government do your job better because

861
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,949
one I don't think a lot of us want to be

862
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,879
paying even more taxes on my government

863
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:15,299
system that's not even like that

864
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:16,558
efficient doing its job already so I

865
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:21,990
think it's part of the community of just

866
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:24,089
enforce again I think at a certain point

867
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:26,279
the market does dictate what ends up

868
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:27,779
working or not so I think in a lot of

869
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,980
these sort of fly-by-night operations

870
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:35,579
end up dying yeah so in a way the

871
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,109
markets are of wins by producing value

872
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:39,030
to customers that people keep coming

873
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:42,089
back well probably it's working for them

874
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:43,470
they don't in Canada for example there's

875
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:45,328
a product called cold death accident

876
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:47,399
whether you guys have that here but it's

877
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:49,349
again an example I guess against what

878
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:51,149
you're saying there's no evidence that

879
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:52,710
cold effects actually staves off you're

880
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:54,379
getting a cold or getting a flu whatever

881
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:57,809
but my goodness is this product ever

882
00:34:54,379 --> 00:35:00,000
popular there's the emergency okay

883
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:05,549
similar thing they had to pay a giant

884
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,530
fine for the FTC and then the government

885
00:35:05,549 --> 00:35:09,390
finds I think in some sense the

886
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,440
government basically only washes people

887
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:12,960
are doing really well and then they're

888
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,660
like okay let's look at these guys is

889
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,940
there some science here if not BAM fine

890
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,799
but all these small guys this surf fly

891
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,089
under the radar I've even seen companies

892
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:22,380
and like I think coca-cola has been

893
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:24,770
guilty of this and other other big

894
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,000
corporations they they can selectively I

895
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,579
mean kind of choose the outcome of their

896
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,619
studies sure and if I find that kind of

897
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:33,540
atrocious and that you know they'll get

898
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:34,829
their own sign corporate scientists to

899
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,150
kind of come up with certain results and

900
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:39,270
publish them in their own journals

901
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:40,230
that's another particular scary area and

902
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,849
I think that's another area that we

903
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,690
probably should be concerned concerned

904
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:44,069
about is

905
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,329
corporate science and the kind of

906
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:46,770
findings that they come up with and

907
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:48,630
anybody else when I just you know chime

908
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:51,390
in on this particular issue as it

909
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,960
pertains to kind of like lying away or

910
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,210
false

911
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,440
you know false products I think it's

912
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,390
interesting that a lot of corporations

913
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,099
that are big and successful actually

914
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:02,640
plan in their corporate budgets we're

915
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:04,500
gonna get a fine right like the the and

916
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,788
because emergency still flying off the

917
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,589
shelves right so they're they're

918
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:09,180
obviously budgeting and dealing with us

919
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:12,619
and the fine and the punishment

920
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:15,359
structure isn't necessarily geared to

921
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:17,190
you know enact some kind of death knell

922
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,808
to the company because the impact of the

923
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:20,190
public is just and they lost some money

924
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,630
right but if it was actually hurting

925
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,549
people then it would be a totally

926
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:26,490
different approach to to penalizing that

927
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:27,660
company so they they if they're good if

928
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:34,529
they can market themselves well enough

929
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:36,210
and they stay in business of the day

930
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:39,390
like building products after you healthy

931
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,890
yeah and there's also the the rebranding

932
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:42,900
of a product so let's take brain

933
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:45,779
training games for example where it's

934
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,670
been quite popular for a while and have

935
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,839
you know study after study shows that it

936
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:51,690
doesn't actually work even remotely

937
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:53,308
close to how the you know the the

938
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:55,260
provider is claiming it and so now you

939
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:56,490
you're how you're seeing um I forget the

940
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,039
names of these companies that escaped me

941
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:00,390
but they're now having to by law you

942
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:01,950
know reframe what it actually is that

943
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:03,990
the product is doing for you that if you

944
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:09,990
know they'll keep you you know alert and

945
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:11,970
or I think they what they got specific

946
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:14,879
in trouble for was there making starting

947
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:16,348
to make claims about Alzheimer's I think

948
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,329
again when you're exciting to do medical

949
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:20,430
claims like hey we're gonna kill your

950
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:22,770
dementia for your old your grandfather

951
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:25,230
and pay us money for that and it doesn't

952
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:26,779
work I think they're rightly like you

953
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:29,369
know you get slapped down for that I

954
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:31,500
George I'll throw in something here and

955
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:33,420
I'll give it a disclaimer please don't

956
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:37,650
construe anything I'm saying as legal

957
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:40,950
advice but if you have a product and you

958
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:43,020
the regulatory agency you end up with it

959
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:45,450
it has lots to do with it with what you

960
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,950
wear how you deal with marketing but if

961
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:49,049
you have a product that doesn't make any

962
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:50,160
medical claims at all you may end up

963
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:52,170
with the Consumer Product Safety

964
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,940
Commission which really has no

965
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,829
regulatory power they don't make rules

966
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,600
that's a good place to go in fact

967
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:58,700
there's no

968
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:01,370
free market approval with Consumer

969
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:03,200
Product Safety Commission and the the

970
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:05,750
only power they really have is to ask

971
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,370
you to recall politely ask you first to

972
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:10,730
recall and then if you don't they can

973
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:13,160
order you to recall but that is that is

974
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:15,230
one avenue that if you keep your product

975
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,430
within the guidelines of consumer

976
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:19,820
product safety commission

977
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:21,470
it's very lightly regulated whereas if

978
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:24,470
you end up with something in the FDA

979
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:25,939
range you're going to be a heavily

980
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,680
regulated it's heavily regulated

981
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,900
industry and then somewhere in the

982
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,240
middle there you have FTC where you can

983
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,790
make crazy claims no matter which agency

984
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,939
you're with with the Federal Trade

985
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:39,800
Commission any good amounts of fraud

986
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:43,480
basically so that's just to kind of a

987
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,480
framework right there to think about

988
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:49,940
just beware of euphemisms

989
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:52,220
when you see rindy ways of saying yeah

990
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:54,470
what the effects are yeah as a consumer

991
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:56,569
take a little bit of responsibility the

992
00:38:54,470 --> 00:39:04,339
old adage if it sounds too good to be

993
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:06,440
true perhaps enhance yeah when one thing

994
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,640
we talked about yesterday at the ethics

995
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,430
discussion this is something that really

996
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,920
interests me greatly is that that

997
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:14,660
constant debate that we're having about

998
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,710
therapy versus enhancement I think

999
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,589
you're touching upon this a bit earlier

1000
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:19,880
Jake and it gets me thinking okay wow

1001
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,770
you know we're actually talking now

1002
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,000
about rina regulations and standards and

1003
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:25,280
and so on

1004
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,450
at what point you know can you start to

1005
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,550
make a claim that these aren't really

1006
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:31,189
necessarily you know therapies that they

1007
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:32,690
actually are medical benefits doesn't

1008
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,130
that silly you know really alter the

1009
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,840
landscape quite dramatically because now

1010
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:37,280
you've got you know medical intervention

1011
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,630
required you've got different regulatory

1012
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,490
bodies involved and now we're even

1013
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,990
potentially talking about for example a

1014
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:44,600
right to access through let's say you're

1015
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:46,549
either insurance or through your you

1016
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,480
know government health care which like

1017
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,010
to speak to that a little bit yeah I

1018
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,380
mean the the lines always blurry these

1019
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:53,690
are incessant conversations and the in

1020
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:55,970
the bioethics community about therapy

1021
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:59,960
versus enhancement versus clinical and

1022
00:39:55,970 --> 00:40:03,230
those things are very historically tied

1023
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,850
and they change quite a bit but you know

1024
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:09,160
I mean one one of the things I've been

1025
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:11,558
thinking about or a cognitive advance

1026
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:14,319
or neurocognitive advantages like Zack

1027
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:16,690
Lynch talks about you know are we using

1028
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:19,119
the the who has access to certain kinds

1029
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:21,670
of drugs to adderall or whatever it is

1030
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:25,150
to help them have a narrow competitive

1031
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:28,240
advantage and is that equitably

1032
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:30,519
distributed or should we if that's an

1033
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,990
enhancement but it's putting people at a

1034
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:35,348
disadvantage you know how do we deal

1035
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:36,339
with that so I most therapy issues that

1036
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,990
I am aware of

1037
00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:40,720
don't put other people at disadvantages

1038
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:42,788
and so I think having that in mind is

1039
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,819
what I'm doing

1040
00:40:42,789 --> 00:40:47,410
fair or is there a societal impact of

1041
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:49,349
this or a certain segment that gets it

1042
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:51,490
and others don't

1043
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:53,109
well I think I think the reason that

1044
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,609
therapies don't typically put people at

1045
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:55,990
disadvantages because they're

1046
00:40:54,609 --> 00:40:58,029
restorative right they're trying to

1047
00:40:55,990 --> 00:41:00,008
achieve and normal back to the back yeah

1048
00:40:58,029 --> 00:41:01,480
yeah whatever right yeah so and and you

1049
00:41:00,009 --> 00:41:04,930
know when you're talking about just

1050
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:06,549
regular stuff like Oscar Pistorius had

1051
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:08,500
the legs in his environment running the

1052
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:10,119
Olympics there was questions as he is he

1053
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,759
enhanced as he is that a therapy you

1054
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:15,039
know but you know yeah we are facing

1055
00:41:12,759 --> 00:41:17,890
this time where our technologies and our

1056
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:19,599
therapies can actually enhance as well

1057
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:22,390
yeah I think it's really an artificial

1058
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,609
bifurcation it's by preg ulation right I

1059
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:27,460
really see that human performance is a

1060
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:29,348
spectrum right you have unhealthy on one

1061
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:31,420
side healthy and enhance states on the

1062
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:34,029
other opposite end right and we're all

1063
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:36,549
on some dimension somewhere on this

1064
00:41:34,029 --> 00:41:39,130
spectrum and we all care about pushing

1065
00:41:36,549 --> 00:41:41,109
people for the healthy enhanced state so

1066
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:43,809
even like this notion of therapy and

1067
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:47,319
handsome technologies there's short term

1068
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:48,549
gains or long term health end up being

1069
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:51,400
like enhancements we're short too many

1070
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:55,019
ways right so I think that's that's one

1071
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:57,009
point I think I think regulation around

1072
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:59,319
enhancement therapies I think they'll be

1073
00:41:57,009 --> 00:42:01,930
blended in the future I think talking

1074
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:05,170
about how these apply in the current

1075
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:06,759
insurance type system I think the notion

1076
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:09,789
arm health savings accounts is really

1077
00:42:06,759 --> 00:42:13,140
interesting Claire right now we were

1078
00:42:09,789 --> 00:42:14,740
mandated to buy insurance policies for

1079
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,269
specific you know you have to go with

1080
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,410
your doctor to get certain things so I

1081
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:20,709
think this notion of health savings

1082
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:21,690
accounts which is a proposal that you

1083
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:25,350
get

1084
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:27,150
so having your employer or having tax

1085
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:29,700
free amount of money paying insurance

1086
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:31,590
you can bucket that into health savings

1087
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:35,339
account that's not taxed that you can

1088
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:39,470
use on various health you know

1089
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:41,910
interventions whether that's implants

1090
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:43,350
medicines etc so I think that kind of

1091
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,359
notion is interesting but it gives you a

1092
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:47,370
freedom now to allocate your own

1093
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:49,410
resources to intervention that you think

1094
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:53,190
is beneficial for yourself but it does

1095
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:55,920
touch on the thing of like the idea is

1096
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:57,570
that it helped healthy populace is good

1097
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,690
for society right and but there is a

1098
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:02,670
there's a limit where that doesn't apply

1099
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:04,320
and and I guess what my point would be a

1100
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:06,420
health savings account because somebody

1101
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,370
wants to they have a totally healthy

1102
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,840
body but they want to get maybe like

1103
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:11,880
breast implants or something because

1104
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,500
they want to feel whatever like there is

1105
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,750
a social function for that I get it but

1106
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,460
there's an allegory to you know where

1107
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,930
people are getting you know food cards

1108
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,000
you know from the government for

1109
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:23,700
sustenance but then they like by Red

1110
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,110
Bull right so if that helping is it to

1111
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:27,149
the point of the program and in the

1112
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:29,250
spirit of it it's it's tough and I'm not

1113
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:31,290
saying it's a bad idea I really like the

1114
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:33,390
idea that that health and performance is

1115
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:35,670
a spectrum and it's a really good point

1116
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:37,589
but my when you're talking about then

1117
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:40,050
overlaying government mandates and and

1118
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:41,520
it just gets tricky because people love

1119
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,290
to gain games I think it's like

1120
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,940
insurance is like a money that's we're

1121
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:47,070
paying out yeah in general so it's like

1122
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:49,050
given that there's this cost that we're

1123
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:51,030
all providing why not give us

1124
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:52,860
flexibility there perhaps not breast

1125
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:54,390
implants but I'm wearing like a blood

1126
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,980
glucose monitor I'm not diabetic or

1127
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:58,200
anything but I can just read my blood

1128
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:01,950
glucose anytime it's tougher for me to

1129
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:04,049
understand okay you know it's a quick

1130
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:05,700
match check-in like you know what's my

1131
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:08,010
child age yeah real-time gauge right

1132
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:10,169
yeah that quick feedback so I think it's

1133
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:11,730
something like that why should that be

1134
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:14,450
tax advantaged why shouldn't that my

1135
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:17,580
insurance dollars go to that instead I

1136
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:19,859
just mentioned one other place that that

1137
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:21,810
law may intervene in this area that we

1138
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:25,290
haven't talked about yet and that is the

1139
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:27,420
judicial system and building on this

1140
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:30,259
idea of cognitive enhancers for

1141
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:33,270
everybody or or just for some people I

1142
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:34,480
like to ask everybody here I like to see

1143
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,310
we are thought on this

1144
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,220
I am one case the court was asked

1145
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:41,200
whether a defendant was competent to

1146
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:46,240
stand trial and they had to decide and

1147
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:48,629
the the psychiatrist said yes if he is

1148
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:53,049
taking a particular cognitive enhancer

1149
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:54,310
so how many of you think that the

1150
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:56,650
defendant should use a cognitive

1151
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:59,650
enhancer to be competent to stand trial

1152
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:01,690
or should he be judged on his competency

1153
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:05,560
without the drug if you think he should

1154
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:08,800
be a cognitive enhancer not like a mood

1155
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:11,620
enhancer just to get him up to restore

1156
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,260
him to it's just enough to be confident

1157
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:17,799
do you think he should have the drug and

1158
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:29,920
stand trial raise your hand if you think

1159
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:32,200
so right yeah that's I was gonna say we

1160
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,660
don't know that but he has to go but we

1161
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:43,359
won't know until we go to trial and hear

1162
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:45,299
the evidence right one question at a

1163
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:47,980
time

1164
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:49,960
I think it's that would be my basis

1165
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:51,850
right oh yeah what was it was the state

1166
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:55,600
of the person making like crying

1167
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:58,089
well competency is it means that you

1168
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,950
understand what's going on well enough

1169
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:02,530
to be informed while you're sitting

1170
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:06,160
there so if you have someone they can't

1171
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:07,930
do that without the drug now remember if

1172
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,810
he's not competent that may tend to

1173
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:13,029
protect him or her somewhat and you may

1174
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:14,950
go with an insanity defense or some

1175
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:17,800
other thing that might also be

1176
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:19,810
protective so you have to be careful

1177
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,060
with that decision you know do I want

1178
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,650
him to be confident or W that would be

1179
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:25,630
the same thing though like if you are

1180
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:27,340
confident us to stand trial but yet you

1181
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:29,380
it comes out in the trial that you were

1182
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:31,510
not on the enhancer so at the time of

1183
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,980
the crime you were insane all of us so

1184
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:35,400
the defense is separate from the

1185
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:43,180
standing trial for sure given the drug

1186
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:45,880
yeah send him to the chair yeah oh yeah

1187
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:48,129
yeah this is great that's a great really

1188
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:50,740
to lay blame when we're talking about

1189
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:52,300
like this right like in the u.s. you can

1190
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:54,160
it's compulsory you have to give blood

1191
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,960
at an alcohol checkpoint and it's drawn

1192
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,480
from non medical professionals but the

1193
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,130
government is taking your blood so can

1194
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,390
they also then take your implant right

1195
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:04,090
so we've been doing a ton of research

1196
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:05,799
into this legally and it's all gray area

1197
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:08,140
if the judge deems it necessary for the

1198
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,750
trial they can take surgery they can do

1199
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:12,609
surgery on you which is not typically

1200
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:14,770
happening what's happening but there was

1201
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:16,060
a you know bank robbery and the guy got

1202
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:18,040
shot and they wanted to take the bullet

1203
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:19,660
out to analyze it to know that prove

1204
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,730
that he was there and the judge actually

1205
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:23,680
said no that's not it the danger to the

1206
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:30,250
person is not worth the trial so it's a

1207
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:31,990
balance rights are not protecting with

1208
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:34,600
that but you can hold back here your

1209
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:36,759
code right it's interesting I think is

1210
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,980
that implant right well where does that

1211
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,110
fall on that spectrum exactly I think

1212
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:44,800
you're referring to the fricasseed case

1213
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:47,260
which was the court asked whether you

1214
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:51,580
could be ordered to disclose to come a

1215
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:53,800
code or if you and the court had to look

1216
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,569
at this analogy they always look at

1217
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,000
analogies is it more like a combination

1218
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:59,320
lock or is it more like key a key you

1219
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,440
could be ordered to hand it to someone

1220
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:04,960
again you disclose what's in your head a

1221
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:07,240
combination lock and the court made a

1222
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,250
distinction no you can't be ordered to

1223
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,529
disclose a code because that could be

1224
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:14,860
incriminating if you are using a fifth

1225
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:17,140
Amendment objection to that I'd like to

1226
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:19,750
open up questions shortly we are running

1227
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:21,400
out of time but before we do so I'm

1228
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:22,420
gonna I like to ask each and every one

1229
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,460
of you kind of put you on the spot a

1230
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:27,250
little bit here and just kind of maybe

1231
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:29,650
give I guess a counterintuitive or even

1232
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:31,300
a no landish prediction this to let's

1233
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:34,180
say the next five to ten years in terms

1234
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:36,460
of regulation and you know what what we

1235
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:39,370
might expect in terms of what we do is

1236
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:41,350
biohackers and body hackers I know it's

1237
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:43,089
gonna be on the spot question I think

1238
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:47,140
Trump's gonna dismantle everything it's

1239
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:49,090
gonna burn I think there's probably

1240
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:51,609
going to be in the next five to ten

1241
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:52,840
years a case right we'come something's

1242
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:55,060
gonna happen someone's gonna get hurt

1243
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:57,220
and it might be because of their own

1244
00:48:55,060 --> 00:49:00,279
negligence or it might be someone else's

1245
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:02,109
but it's it's gonna be tested in the

1246
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,060
courts right I don't think anything

1247
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:05,410
levels gonna necessarily come down

1248
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:08,170
because of that unless it's like some

1249
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:09,850
senator's daughter or something but yeah

1250
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:11,320
we're gonna it's gonna be test in the

1251
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:12,640
card biohacking is gonna be tested in

1252
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,650
the courts I think it's a very good

1253
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,839
prediction yeah yeah no I think I think

1254
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:19,090
you the Trump thing is interesting where

1255
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,470
you know whether your browser politics

1256
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:25,000
he's looking at interesting people for

1257
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:27,730
FDA director I think it was rumored that

1258
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,890
one of my friends apologies from Abbas

1259
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:31,900
on was being considered I think some of

1260
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:33,339
these people are a lot more open around

1261
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,990
being experimental being a lot more

1262
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:39,700
forward-thinking rent regulation and

1263
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:43,000
bring things to market faster so I think

1264
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:45,160
that I think the government might be

1265
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,940
more amenable to what we're doing then

1266
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:51,190
we might expect my prediction yeah I

1267
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:53,260
think we're optimistic and we look at

1268
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:55,810
one of the reasons Trump was elected was

1269
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:57,220
to have small business do better and

1270
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:59,740
have a better environment for that which

1271
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:04,839
would mean less impediments and less

1272
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:06,459
barriers to engaging and exploring new

1273
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:08,860
technologies and building new exciting

1274
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:10,870
companies they're also talked about

1275
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:12,340
maybe reforming the FDA a little bit I

1276
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:13,540
know I don't that's a Trump specific

1277
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,550
thing but I know that's been a general

1278
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:17,110
discussion that I know I'm frustrated

1279
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:19,150
always with how long it takes the FDA to

1280
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:20,410
kind of get Italy I mean I love the FDA

1281
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:22,060
I think they're massively hugely

1282
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:23,500
important but my goodness do they ever

1283
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:26,230
need to be shaken up a little bit yeah

1284
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:29,260
there was some the one time that you

1285
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:30,760
might push FDA to go faster is with a

1286
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:33,250
public health emergency like by a

1287
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:37,240
bioterrorism attack and they did try a

1288
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:39,420
fast track to make their products get

1289
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,950
through the approval process faster and

1290
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:44,140
honestly it did not go much faster at

1291
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:46,450
all so it's really going to take

1292
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,980
Congress to do something with that

1293
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:50,140
legislation and they're gonna be really

1294
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,400
reluctant to do that every time you get

1295
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:53,830
an announcement that a drug

1296
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,060
recall is happened and every time they

1297
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:57,250
get ready to do something we've got a

1298
00:50:55,060 --> 00:51:00,250
massive drug recall and they get worried

1299
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:03,160
that they can't disturb the the lengthy

1300
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:05,380
process so we're going to have to have

1301
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:07,870
Congress really get behind this to come

1302
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:10,440
up with a way to work with FDA to come

1303
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:12,520
up with a pastor a more efficient system

1304
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,220
you know that could be modeling on a

1305
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:20,580
computer rather than using

1306
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:23,430
animals and humans are we unfair to say

1307
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:25,770
that we are pretty haven't even severely

1308
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:28,049
risk-averse when it comes to these

1309
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:30,390
things like as the FDA this a little too

1310
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:31,650
paranoid about potential horns well

1311
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:33,660
we've been compared to other countries

1312
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:35,670
and France for example likes to go

1313
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:38,609
things on the market faster than we do

1314
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:41,400
at least that's that's the common

1315
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:43,230
thought I don't know if it really is

1316
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,630
true but if they do seem to get their

1317
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:48,990
products help before we do one or two

1318
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:52,140
generations ahead so maybe we are risk

1319
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:55,950
averse when it comes to drugs versus

1320
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:58,470
devices right devices I see not a huge

1321
00:51:55,950 --> 00:52:00,689
reason for there to be a delay but drugs

1322
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:01,980
are difficult because the delay the

1323
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:05,400
delay that you're fighting with a drug

1324
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:08,070
is long term effects right so if it

1325
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,140
takes ten years to go through a real

1326
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:11,790
long term effect study that's the issue

1327
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:13,560
like a device you can you can do

1328
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:15,270
cytotoxicity doesn't you do all kinds of

1329
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,640
testing and figure out yeah as long as

1330
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:19,650
you manufacture it consistently and it's

1331
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,150
good right and this the long term

1332
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:23,520
effects are the materials have been

1333
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:26,250
around decades you know so the

1334
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,870
challenges with the drugs is yeah like

1335
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:31,170
are we gonna have a situation where you

1336
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:32,850
know in twenty thirty years suddenly 80%

1337
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:35,040
of the population has cancer like yeah

1338
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:36,839
you know it's hard to it's hard to push

1339
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,460
those types of things yeah you know I

1340
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:40,680
think well would we would be the way to

1341
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:44,970
fix this problem is incrementally allow

1342
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:46,980
greater exceptions for off-label uses or

1343
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:47,730
to experiment with people who give their

1344
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:50,190
consent

1345
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:53,100
right now this government is very

1346
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:55,380
heavy-handed with with no we're not even

1347
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:57,120
in the way you give consent you remember

1348
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,550
that was a big issue during that while

1349
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:01,500
HIV patients were waiting and waiting

1350
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:03,780
for approval when they would have gladly

1351
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:06,450
have given their consent balanced

1352
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:08,700
against their risk of a laughing longer

1353
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:11,100
life and they weren't allowed to do that

1354
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:13,080
so this is my question legally so it's

1355
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:15,180
my understanding that a doctor is

1356
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:17,130
totally within their rights legal to

1357
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:19,589
prescribed off-label for whatever they

1358
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:22,170
want it's not a regulation issue that

1359
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:23,850
it's a liability issue so if they the

1360
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:26,040
doctors that I've just not spoken to

1361
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:27,299
they said if I prescribe for any

1362
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,490
off-label use and there's a

1363
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:31,500
problem my malpractice insurance will

1364
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:33,569
not cover it and it becomes a financial

1365
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:36,540
problem for the doctor not a regulatory

1366
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:39,660
problem but it is there as any situation

1367
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:41,759
where the FDA for approving that are

1368
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:42,839
already approved I get it for unapproved

1369
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,500
things where they're not going to make

1370
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,120
an exception

1371
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:47,070
but for approve things I'm pretty sure

1372
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:50,339
it's in the doctor's purview to do that

1373
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:52,170
I understand I I'm just from my

1374
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:55,500
conversations with physicians that they

1375
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:58,290
have broad discretion I'm off-label uses

1376
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:00,450
yeah I didn't will leave you out and

1377
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:02,820
either to continue with this particular

1378
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:06,390
threat or my question about yeah I was

1379
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:09,630
launched into something so in ten years

1380
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:13,109
we'll say 2027 all you guys are really

1381
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:15,300
at a dilemma point because you you're

1382
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:17,100
trying to decide what do I live in the

1383
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,660
Republic of California which has a

1384
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:21,240
little bit stricter more risk-averse

1385
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:22,770
profile for regulation or do I remain in

1386
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:25,529
the kind of wild-west version of the US

1387
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:27,360
that exists but most of those insights

1388
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:29,010
are either surveilled or weaponized

1389
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:31,020
immediately so I'm trying to decide

1390
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:33,450
whether I can whether I go with the safe

1391
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:35,340
place of kind of and kind of regulated

1392
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:38,779
environment of the independent

1393
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:41,370
California or is this non democratic

1394
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:42,750
fascist state of the remaining us the

1395
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:44,549
place where I want to go where have a

1396
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:46,650
lot more freedom to experiment but the

1397
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:49,310
uses of that might come out in different

1398
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,310
ways than I intended

1399
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:55,770
we're talking about a Consumer

1400
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:56,940
Protection Bureau those things may not

1401
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:59,310
exist in a couple of years I mean

1402
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:02,580
legitimately yeah yeah the the the

1403
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:04,110
normal regulatory system and the process

1404
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:05,430
all of those things are judiciary all

1405
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:07,830
those things are up for grabs in a way

1406
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:10,770
that I think we need to acknowledge as

1407
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:12,240
scary as it is you know everything's on

1408
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:14,009
the table now we're in a way that it

1409
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:17,339
hasn't been before and I think in the in

1410
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:19,590
the the government purview is to protect

1411
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:21,450
the sort of public from risk that that's

1412
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:23,400
gone right that's out the window with

1413
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:26,189
this administration now it's how do we

1414
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:28,110
get things how do we improve the economy

1415
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:29,970
and commerce money right I mean if you

1416
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:32,160
look at any of the changes it's it's

1417
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:33,540
about that it's you know the

1418
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,520
environmental protection stuff is

1419
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:37,860
actively being worked against because

1420
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,940
it's not a it's impacting money and it's

1421
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:41,130
you know we don't care about safety

1422
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:42,450
anymore so if you just kind of blanket

1423
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:44,490
approach like I think you're right it

1424
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:46,769
could it could fundamentally change the

1425
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:48,508
approach and Wild West is kind of where

1426
00:55:46,769 --> 00:55:49,828
we're going and even if that extreme

1427
00:55:48,509 --> 00:55:53,069
version of which I'm giving and maybe

1428
00:55:49,829 --> 00:55:54,599
not be extreme but I think they push the

1429
00:55:53,069 --> 00:55:56,210
thinking from it's gonna be at a federal

1430
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:58,170
level to more state and local

1431
00:55:56,210 --> 00:56:00,660
regulations it's gonna be way more

1432
00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:02,759
fragmented I think that's no matter what

1433
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:04,769
right if we remain whole or if something

1434
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:07,200
massive happens I think we're gonna be

1435
00:56:04,769 --> 00:56:09,479
looking at way much more localized

1436
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,368
decentralized approaches to this and and

1437
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,869
and that's gonna be difficult that

1438
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:14,490
fragmented world is gonna open up

1439
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:16,589
opportunities but it's gonna be alright

1440
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:18,598
except that's hard for commerce right so

1441
00:56:16,589 --> 00:56:19,920
if you apply the Commerce role right I

1442
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:22,559
dumped us about making money right so

1443
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,180
that that might not happen and when you

1444
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,980
default dude you default to California

1445
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,078
emission standards yeah because that's a

1446
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:30,359
big market argue you know do you have

1447
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,170
different kinds of products and rules

1448
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:32,700
for different places

1449
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:35,579
yeah a big question it's kind of

1450
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:37,618
interesting last week how I think the

1451
00:56:35,579 --> 00:56:39,299
the didn't the dow jones finished i got

1452
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:41,250
a record high and the commentators were

1453
00:56:39,299 --> 00:56:43,049
saying is because you know investors are

1454
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:44,220
feeling that with you know the new

1455
00:56:43,049 --> 00:56:46,500
administration that there's no

1456
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:48,328
regulations now and there's like you

1457
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:50,730
said not a concern with safety and such

1458
00:56:48,329 --> 00:56:52,500
and i'm thinking wow like really the

1459
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:53,880
that they see that they see this as such

1460
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:56,369
an opportunity to make some money and

1461
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,109
I'm wondering though you know what are

1462
00:56:56,369 --> 00:57:00,029
going to be those long-term costs that

1463
00:56:58,109 --> 00:57:02,069
they're not accountable for yeah because

1464
00:57:00,029 --> 00:57:04,619
it's going to be cost I like to just

1465
00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:08,250
mention it's not the free-for-all bed it

1466
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:10,890
sounds like because the an executive

1467
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:13,619
branch cannot change legislative right

1468
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:16,529
yes establish laws and regulations they

1469
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:19,289
would have to be go through a long

1470
00:57:16,529 --> 00:57:22,680
process of being repealed any regulation

1471
00:57:19,289 --> 00:57:24,509
which is which is on top of the law so

1472
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:26,430
it's not really going to be the

1473
00:57:24,509 --> 00:57:29,880
free-for-all that it sounds like it's

1474
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:33,808
really just an increment is even though

1475
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:35,279
it we all we all pay attention any time

1476
00:57:33,809 --> 00:57:36,930
there's an incremental shift in any

1477
00:57:35,279 --> 00:57:40,380
direction ten years of increments that

1478
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:46,169
adds up I want to see some measurable

1479
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:48,100
changes I'm seeing all that risk

1480
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:52,240
regulation is still there

1481
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:53,020
I think we're in overtime now but I

1482
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,910
think we're having such a wonderful

1483
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:58,590
conversation I would like to open it up

1484
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:58,589
to some questions Sam you go right ahead

1485
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:08,230
there are regulations that exist in

1486
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:11,049
order to keep humans from enhancing at

1487
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:14,050
the rate that we're enhancing due to

1488
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:17,530
environmental availability like do you

1489
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:20,860
think that if those procedures weren't

1490
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:24,490
there and we enhanced or got to the

1491
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:25,780
healthy enhanced scale as a population

1492
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:32,709
that there would be a need for

1493
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:35,770
population control its kind of

1494
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:38,080
meandering I think that I mean if China

1495
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:39,820
is an example right before they they did

1496
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:43,779
try to control their population growth

1497
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:44,800
and the reasons for that I'm not quite

1498
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:47,620
sure I don't know that they necessarily

1499
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:49,720
ran out of resources but they definitely

1500
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:51,730
needed to optimize their their resource

1501
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:53,830
and production so I mean we're kind of

1502
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:56,770
already in this ongoing resource war

1503
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:59,440
right but it's for energy it's not for

1504
00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:01,330
like sustenance that's you know that's

1505
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:05,470
kind of we have too much food like watch

1506
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:08,410
it so yeah it seems it seems strange

1507
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:11,140
that like higher performing humans might

1508
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:13,060
be more efficient so hopefully that's

1509
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:15,040
part of it part of the enhancement can

1510
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:16,690
be functioning more efficiently in the

1511
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:20,740
environment for the given resources and

1512
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:22,120
so it might solve itself I've given this

1513
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:24,100
particular subject a lot of thought I'm

1514
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:25,720
involved in thoughts as it pertains to

1515
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,560
radical life extension for example which

1516
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,879
is something we haven't even really

1517
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:29,350
talked about at this class because

1518
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:32,020
that's a whole conference unto itself

1519
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:34,450
yeah but and because one of the charges

1520
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:36,280
that you initially you know receive on

1521
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:38,140
discussions of radical life extension of

1522
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:41,590
course is the overpopulation problem and

1523
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:43,060
as you correctly noted the these kinds

1524
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:44,770
of Malthusian nightmares aren't

1525
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:46,330
necessarily fair because what we're

1526
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:47,830
really talking about is not the sheer

1527
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:49,840
number of people that are on this planet

1528
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:51,670
it's our it's the collective you know

1529
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:55,030
ecological footprint that we all occupy

1530
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:57,070
and as we know full well right now the

1531
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:59,410
world cannot possibly be sustained if

1532
00:59:57,070 --> 01:00:01,330
everyone lived to our you know developed

1533
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:04,089
standards

1534
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:05,380
it's just I think Ghia Wilson he said we

1535
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:07,690
would need you know on the order of four

1536
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:09,250
to five planet Earth's to bring everyone

1537
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:10,870
up to view no well I'd say Western

1538
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:12,520
standards of living that's not going to

1539
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:14,799
happen unless of course we start to

1540
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:17,410
innovate you know start to bring down

1541
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:20,200
the that footprint energy is definitely

1542
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:22,779
a huge area there you know of course

1543
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:24,490
pollute less and you know recycle more

1544
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:26,560
all those you know the whole the whole

1545
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:28,209
thing um at the end of the day you know

1546
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:30,310
will there ever be too many people on

1547
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:33,310
this planet maybe you know if if people

1548
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:34,930
definitely stop dying that's kind of

1549
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:38,320
obviously it would be represent a

1550
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:39,609
radical shift in human demography but

1551
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,650
you can start to do things like you know

1552
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:43,870
build mega cities and venture out into

1553
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:45,640
space and even potentially venture into

1554
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:48,220
cyberspace as digital beings we're gonna

1555
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:49,960
get super trans humanistic so these are

1556
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:51,669
fascinating questions to kind of wonder

1557
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,650
about but at the end of the day as a

1558
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:55,780
component of life extension and radical

1559
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:57,130
I position in particular I'd like to

1560
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:59,710
think that the answer is not death but

1561
01:00:57,130 --> 01:01:01,900
the answer is life and it maybe I'm

1562
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:02,980
naive ly optimistic about that but

1563
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,780
that's where I think that's where I come

1564
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:08,260
from I like that answer I mean I think

1565
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:10,060
that we in our 80 years on on this

1566
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:12,130
planet we developed so much expertise

1567
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:13,900
imagine if like Einstein was still here

1568
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:15,340
you'd be down much smarter that much

1569
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:19,120
more experience run like thinking about

1570
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:20,440
up new laws of physics right I think in

1571
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:22,420
a lot of ways we accelerate our

1572
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,520
enhancement as we have longer and longer

1573
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:26,830
lives because they have decades and

1574
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:28,810
decades of more exponential knowledge in

1575
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:30,970
our domain areas so I think as we

1576
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:32,650
extended life our expertise and

1577
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:35,560
enhancing herself like sort of just

1578
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:37,270
picks up yeah I think the efficiency

1579
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:39,070
argument makes that self yeah I mean

1580
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:40,720
it's not it's more to more than just

1581
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:46,150
having longer life if you don't increase

1582
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:52,629
efficiency because 80 years 400 right

1583
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:54,250
exactly the the cessation of Aging or

1584
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:55,660
what Aubert degree calls negligible

1585
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:58,810
senescence which I love that that

1586
01:01:55,660 --> 01:02:02,310
terrible building the key word as long

1587
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:02,310
as it happens after the boomers are gone

1588
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:06,850
things that I think about because you

1589
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:08,470
know I get another not that I want to

1590
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:11,350
dwell on this issue too much but one of

1591
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:13,029
the charges again is that that you're

1592
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:14,980
going to have a stunted society that

1593
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:17,530
there will not be any social change

1594
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:19,000
the generations stopped dying which is

1595
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:20,290
kind of a sad commentary on social

1596
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,820
change on a Sunday the only way we

1597
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:23,109
actually have meaningful social changes

1598
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:26,140
when the old generation kicks the bucket

1599
01:02:23,109 --> 01:02:27,970
and their values are gone no but if you

1600
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:29,259
if they stop dying and stop having kids

1601
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:32,770
it's the introduction of new ideas

1602
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:36,730
that's the something I think credit to

1603
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:39,280
baby boomers you know I think I perhaps

1604
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:41,650
no other generation you know ever has

1605
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:44,440
maybe from the day they were born until

1606
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:47,619
where they are now has had to bear so

1607
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:50,020
much I think social change and but a lot

1608
01:02:47,619 --> 01:02:52,359
of it their own doing clearly but also a

1609
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:53,920
lot of it I think kind of just realizing

1610
01:02:52,359 --> 01:02:55,390
ok this is the general thrust of you

1611
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,520
know social change and we're gonna kind

1612
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:58,990
of you know adapt so I'm not all that

1613
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,750
pessimistic that I kind of Jared talker

1614
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:04,209
so you know I'm not like mr. Jarrett ah

1615
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:05,650
Chrissy will establish hold in how do

1616
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:21,700
you feel about a government mandate for

1617
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:23,740
intelligent people to have kids I think

1618
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:25,480
the rest of Europe and tell me but I'm

1619
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:27,640
off track here but I think you're asking

1620
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:31,600
can you do you think there might be

1621
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:35,129
regulating enhancement to stop it to try

1622
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:38,799
to stop it or prevent it or regulate it

1623
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:41,020
to limit it yeah well I might give you

1624
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:42,820
this example which I find very

1625
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:45,550
interesting and maybe telling about the

1626
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:47,680
future and that is Duke University yes

1627
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:51,340
now a policy that students are not to

1628
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:52,960
use any cognitive enhancers is against

1629
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:56,170
the rules if your student at Duke

1630
01:03:52,960 --> 01:04:00,250
University not other universities so my

1631
01:03:56,170 --> 01:04:02,970
question is is Duke ahead of its time

1632
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:07,000
or is it gonna be left back in time

1633
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:08,950
which is it yeah I definitely think

1634
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,090
that's a step backwards I think it's

1635
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:12,339
you're gonna be a Luddite you're gonna

1636
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:14,680
be like Amish people I think it's like

1637
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:16,630
action airy you don't suck human

1638
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:18,730
progress right like if you don't

1639
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:21,160
participate in this accelerated

1640
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:23,950
evolution of our species then you will

1641
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:25,210
be deprecated up we are definitely in

1642
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:26,830
over time now that I want to hear this

1643
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:27,700
question two quick questions one you

1644
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:31,630
talked about virtue

1645
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:33,279
enhancement and moral implications of

1646
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:36,400
this I'd love to hear more about that

1647
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:38,230
and also automation is replacing a lot

1648
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,510
of blue-collar jobs right now and even a

1649
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:41,799
lot jobs and white-collar industries do

1650
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:44,349
you think that the future of

1651
01:04:41,799 --> 01:04:47,680
augmentation can have the same effects

1652
01:04:44,349 --> 01:04:49,900
and what is the democratization over the

1653
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:54,720
long period of body augmentation and

1654
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:57,099
enhancement on the workforce especially

1655
01:04:54,720 --> 01:05:00,129
blue-collar industries in manufacturing

1656
01:04:57,099 --> 01:05:01,470
if that's even an appropriate connection

1657
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:04,240
to make

1658
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:05,828
yeah and you can probably know a little

1659
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:10,569
more than me but it's basically in you

1660
01:05:05,829 --> 01:05:14,589
to DJ use from ie about it but the idea

1661
01:05:10,569 --> 01:05:17,140
if we can locate where empathy lies how

1662
01:05:14,589 --> 01:05:18,940
that works how compassion works we have

1663
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:20,920
a language for that and then we can

1664
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:22,960
begin to tweak the knobs yeah would we

1665
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,859
want to do that what we want to we

1666
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,390
always think about cognitive

1667
01:05:23,859 --> 01:05:27,430
enhancements an intelligence enhancement

1668
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:29,379
but what about human feeling empathy

1669
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:32,230
compassion those kinds of qualities that

1670
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:34,569
we value if we had a knob to turn could

1671
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:36,760
we should we do that as the basic case

1672
01:05:34,569 --> 01:05:39,369
and we are we are finding that language

1673
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:42,760
we're decoding it and so that questions

1674
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:44,799
are becoming real the president's

1675
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:47,440
bioethics Commission actually thought

1676
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:50,410
about this question about what is happy

1677
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:52,660
and they pointed out that we believe

1678
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:55,899
that you should be happy based on good

1679
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:58,049
moral character and should happiness

1680
01:05:55,900 --> 01:06:00,970
come from something other than that and

1681
01:05:58,049 --> 01:06:04,359
should we allow that that was actually

1682
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:06,040
the discussion so it comes down to what

1683
01:06:04,359 --> 01:06:08,109
is their definition of happy and where's

1684
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:11,160
it derived from and is it okay to be

1685
01:06:08,109 --> 01:06:14,529
happy from a drug or an enhancement

1686
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:16,868
versus the source of happiness from good

1687
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:21,809
moral character has been the traditional

1688
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:21,809
value clockwork orange' argument right

1689
01:06:22,109 --> 01:06:26,319
it's been found that the seat of

1690
01:06:24,069 --> 01:06:28,509
medicine at tylenol actually lowers

1691
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:32,529
empathy oh yeah there's a study on it

1692
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:35,319
check it out well yeah that's the good

1693
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:38,500
part and the second part of the question

1694
01:06:35,319 --> 01:06:40,339
as it dealt with automation I I believe

1695
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:45,559
I mean I can adjust

1696
01:06:40,339 --> 01:06:47,808
a little bit I think I mean some of our

1697
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:48,829
smartest minds are building AI building

1698
01:06:47,809 --> 01:06:50,869
automation right like we're almost

1699
01:06:48,829 --> 01:06:55,190
accelerating the deprecation of humans I

1700
01:06:50,869 --> 01:06:57,009
think that like what our comedic sing

1701
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:59,749
about enhancing humanity we're really

1702
01:06:57,009 --> 01:07:01,130
III think this is an exaggeration but I

1703
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:04,160
think we're like arming ourselves in

1704
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:05,869
this like potential battle against rope

1705
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:08,089
a by taking over everything right we

1706
01:07:05,869 --> 01:07:10,789
should be investing were are smart

1707
01:07:08,089 --> 01:07:15,259
resources smart people look at enhancing

1708
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:19,299
our capabilities so in short let's

1709
01:07:15,259 --> 01:07:19,299
enhance ourselves so we're not useless

1710
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:25,450
yeah on the robotics issue I there's a

1711
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:28,519
lot of discussion about that and about

1712
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:30,140
people want a job so maybe we are going

1713
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:31,700
to have to just give everybody a common

1714
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:34,160
salary and all those sorts of things I

1715
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:37,189
think that totally misses the point that

1716
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:40,399
that people really want to do a job and

1717
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:42,920
there's a huge amount of human respect

1718
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:44,749
and self-respect that you derive from

1719
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:47,089
doing a job that contributes to society

1720
01:07:44,749 --> 01:07:49,098
and I think we'll just have a lot of

1721
01:07:47,089 --> 01:07:52,210
different jobs but they will be there

1722
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:54,380
and I often think if we went back to

1723
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:57,140
George Washington and we sat there and

1724
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:58,849
told them about what careers what career

1725
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:03,288
options we had now wouldn't even

1726
01:07:58,849 --> 01:08:05,660
understand the words you know so why

1727
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:07,579
wouldn't we expect that to continue to

1728
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:10,430
happen certainly bring in Austin where

1729
01:08:07,579 --> 01:08:11,509
slacker was films I want to make a case

1730
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:13,669
that wage

1731
01:08:11,509 --> 01:08:15,289
wage slave jobs and that don't

1732
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:17,149
necessarily life fulfilling and then

1733
01:08:15,289 --> 01:08:18,279
giving people the time to do things if

1734
01:08:17,149 --> 01:08:20,210
you think about the movie slacker

1735
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:21,739
they're people everybody's doing cool

1736
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:23,389
stuff they're not working at a job

1737
01:08:21,738 --> 01:08:24,589
typically but they're doing experimental

1738
01:08:23,389 --> 01:08:26,750
things so if we're talking about body

1739
01:08:24,589 --> 01:08:28,818
hacking a universal basic income with

1740
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:32,899
the universal healthcare will open up

1741
01:08:28,819 --> 01:08:34,549
everyone and a way to to explore with an

1742
01:08:32,899 --> 01:08:36,649
experiment on themselves the risk is

1743
01:08:34,549 --> 01:08:38,000
less and they're not and their time will

1744
01:08:36,649 --> 01:08:39,939
be more to do that so I think there

1745
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,259
could be an explosion of experimentation

1746
01:08:39,939 --> 01:08:45,649
given that baseline if that security is

1747
01:08:42,259 --> 01:08:47,299
provided awesome let's end on that very

1748
01:08:45,649 --> 01:08:50,269
optimistic note thanks everyone for

1749
01:08:47,299 --> 01:08:54,469
again a wonderful discussion and

1750
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:54,469
[Applause]
