1
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,530
hi everyone I'm Olly McBride from open

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,430
bionics and today I'm talking about our

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,500
company what we do and why we do it so

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,750
we're a robotics company based in the UK

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:27,540
and and we specialize in developing

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:31,020
artificial limbs amputees so today I'm

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:33,420
sure you've met angel and Jason sort of

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,890
throughout the weekend they were wearing

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,510
some of the latest Bionic hands that are

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,550
available and so they're costing about

11
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:44,129
$100,000 which is just we think a bit

12
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:48,569
too expensive so and that makes them

13
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:52,068
inaccessible and so even with insurance

14
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,449
people can't really afford to get them

15
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:57,059
so early from bionics we're trying to

16
00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:00,718
take the functionality of those hands

17
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:05,158
that cost up to $100,000 and reproduce

18
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,710
them for that 20 times cheaper and so we

19
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,370
use 3d printing and so we choose 3d

20
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:18,229
printing over sort of the injection

21
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:21,060
molding and other mass market and sorry

22
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:23,689
sorry other manufacturing techniques

23
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,090
just because I'm sure as you're aware

24
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:31,309
everyone's hands different sizes so we

25
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:34,860
3d print a custom hand for every person

26
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:37,100
so I open bionics and our aim is to

27
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,149
create and to democracy democratize

28
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:42,419
technology that enhances the human body

29
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:45,210
so we see ourselves building assistive

30
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,759
tech for the masses we have the robotic

31
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,428
engineering skills to create devices

32
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,399
that solve a real human problem so

33
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:57,600
essentially we tend disabilities into

34
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:00,780
superpowers so even bionics we've been

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,908
running for about two years and and over

36
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,119
those two years we've won a number of

37
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:08,009
awards so last year we won the James

38
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,210
Dyson Award for innovative engineering

39
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:14,579
and we're at CES and we won the best

40
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,530
Kinect innovation and then we're also

41
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:20,519
named as one of the top 10 most

42
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,300
innovative companies and so why we sort

43
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:22,740
of

44
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,690
winning these awards and why we're

45
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,880
getting noticed well we're doing it

46
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,750
differently and we're all we're

47
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,840
completely open source

48
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:33,270
hence the name open bionics and all of

49
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,180
our files and software available online

50
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,250
completely for free and so I've met a

51
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,660
few people here today that have actually

52
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,630
downloaded those hands and printed on

53
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,600
themselves and and were open source

54
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,490
because we believe that a community all

55
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,590
working together with a common goal can

56
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:53,010
make prosthetics more accessible and

57
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,230
more available so because anyone

58
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,480
recognize this picture or at least

59
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,489
what's in this picture so this was a big

60
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,269
news story probably just over a year ago

61
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:06,630
and it was the first 3d file ever sent

62
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:09,900
to space and 3d printed so NASA sent the

63
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:12,180
file the STL file of this range up to

64
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,070
the space station well as any 3d printed

65
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,060
and they could use it as a proper tool

66
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:20,959
and so not to one-up an ass or anything

67
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:24,570
but we sent a bionic limb over email and

68
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,930
this is a I think it was a marine vet

69
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,120
who lost his limbs in Afghanistan it's

70
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,040
called Taylor and he found our

71
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,000
technology online all of our open source

72
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:38,970
free files and with the help of a friend

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,370
he downloaded the files and 3d printed

74
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,430
his own custom bionic hand in his garage

75
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,080
so this is why we did it because like

76
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,830
otherwise he wouldn't been able to have

77
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,840
a custom hand and the technology he had

78
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,970
available to him by his existing

79
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,130
prosthesis just weren't giving him

80
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,489
enough functionality so he made sweet

81
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:02,250
made his own and so we also use the

82
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:04,470
latest in 3d scanning technology this up

83
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,260
here is actually a smartphone with a 3d

84
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:11,850
scanner attachment and so we can scan

85
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:13,709
the amputees residual in typically when

86
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,858
an amputee goes to get a socket fitted

87
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:19,769
out there prosthetist they have like a

88
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:22,500
plaster cast session which can take

89
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,540
quite a long time and the plaster cast

90
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,960
I hit stuff with it sets so that can

91
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,460
cause issues with the sort of if you've

92
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,989
got a sensitive limb you can cause

93
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,659
issues and there's quite an unpleasant

94
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,810
experience but with a 3d scanner takes

95
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,060
us two minutes

96
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,820
you just not even touch the limb just

97
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:43,540
take a 3d file or a 3d scan of this arm

98
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,700
and we get 3d files straight away so we

99
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,190
then take this 3d file import it into

100
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,750
our CAD software we use something called

101
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:54,610
blender which is another open source

102
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:56,889
really manipulation tool and we design a

103
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,930
custom bionic socket and a custom Bionic

104
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:01,419
hands and then we learn 3d print them

105
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,220
and we have it all in five days so what

106
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:05,740
typically takes a prosthetist or

107
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:10,860
clinician about three months we've done

108
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:14,169
in less than a week and so here are

109
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,460
we've got Nikko in the orange down in

110
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:17,380
the middle and then grace on the left

111
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,510
and open bionics

112
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,870
we don't just design for amputees we

113
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:25,270
design with amputees so Nikko here lost

114
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:28,419
his right hand in an industrial accident

115
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,609
a few years ago and and he was one

116
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:32,590
wearing one of our early prototypes as

117
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,560
you can see you've got an Orion socket

118
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:37,869
and orange 3d printed hands and a blue

119
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,110
battery that in that version it was just

120
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:43,870
cable tie to the outside and it was

121
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,880
actually an incredible guy he and since

122
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:48,340
he lost his Lyn he's become like a

123
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,919
bionic inventor so he makes robotic

124
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,669
hands and robotic attachments just at

125
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:56,409
home it's incredible stuff in the middle

126
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:58,180
we have Dan and that's you've been

127
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,220
working with Dan since pretty much day

128
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,580
one he email just just as we're starting

129
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:06,970
the company and asked if basically if we

130
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,919
needed a hand and someone to test all

131
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,470
our products and basically give us

132
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:14,109
feedback and he's warned I think almost

133
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,860
every single prototype from day one so

134
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:20,229
he's been really useful to have on board

135
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:23,050
and then on the end we have Grace who is

136
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:25,570
part model part actress and based in the

137
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:29,380
UK and she was born with a foreshortened

138
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:32,880
forum so similar to angel and just past

139
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:35,950
the elbow she is actually wearing a

140
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,159
fashion design hands so it's got fiber

141
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,159
up

142
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:47,270
so is that good cool so it's got fiber

143
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,008
optics down the arm that light up issue

144
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:53,389
walks and then also it's studied in

145
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:55,669
sports key crystals that's how you say

146
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:58,189
it and like thousands of them

147
00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:07,729
it took us I think like three or four

148
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:08,930
days exact good again took us about

149
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:10,909
three or four days to put all those

150
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:14,659
crystals on there it was a we're not

151
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:16,610
going to do that again and so why are we

152
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:19,789
creating these hands so this is an

153
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:22,610
actual prosthetic given to a child in

154
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:24,949
the u.s. to wear and it's literally just

155
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:28,099
a lump of plastic skin colored hand

156
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:31,099
shaped plastic and some velcro it's like

157
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:33,919
no one wants to wear that and so this is

158
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:36,139
Logan a 12 year old kid that we were

159
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,318
fortunate enough to work with just last

160
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:41,180
year in Los Angeles and he was also born

161
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,520
with the foreshortened forum and this is

162
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,669
actual prosthetic that he was given sort

163
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:50,060
of to wear to school it's just yeah not

164
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:51,919
that useful and and so like most

165
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,080
amputees Logan wasn't happy with the

166
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,359
prosthetics he had available to him and

167
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,330
this is even through insurance it's just

168
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:02,029
it's not that great and so we worked

169
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:04,399
with him and other amputees to sort of

170
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:07,330
put like a mood board together of what

171
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:10,520
people wanted what people could have and

172
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:12,709
and so we asked them like what would you

173
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,680
want on your bionic limb if technology

174
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:17,659
was not an issue and so for example it

175
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,669
could be a beauticians makeup bag where

176
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:23,149
you've got a mirror in the palm and like

177
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:24,649
a lipstick and a finger and it could be

178
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:27,050
an explorer's rucksack so you've got a

179
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:30,740
compass and like a laser and a torch

180
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,299
maybe even a lighter and and then it

181
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,000
could also be like an artist canvas like

182
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:36,620
a whiteboard so completely white arm and

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,919
they can color it in depending on how

184
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:42,760
they're feeling that day and basically

185
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:47,300
with a 3d printer and some know-how and

186
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:52,130
you're completely limitless and so this

187
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:53,930
is an actual cartoon drawn for us by the

188
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,779
Marvel comic team

189
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:59,810
and it's basically they love drawings

190
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:02,630
and technologies they write here trying

191
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:04,520
to create this and so this is what we

192
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:09,020
want to try and do we want to turn kids

193
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:11,300
into Bionic superheroes and so this is

194
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,180
one of our renders for the Ironman hand

195
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:16,310
for a model and we were actually the

196
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,199
first company to take a man's hand and

197
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,989
turn it into a prosthetic a fully

198
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,240
self-contained

199
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:25,459
this is the Disney frozen hand there was

200
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,500
obviously loads of sparkles and snowy

201
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:29,479
things and this is my personal favorite

202
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:33,279
and this is the Star Wars lightsaber

203
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:36,920
hand and and it looks pretty cool but

204
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:39,410
like they're just renders so we built

205
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:43,250
them so this is Logan again wearing

206
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:45,740
these lightsaber hand and and so when he

207
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,720
turns it on it goes like a proper

208
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,760
lightsaber he's actually wearing in Luke

209
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,950
Skywalker mode at the moment and so

210
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,779
that's blue and he can press a button

211
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,720
and it would turn off as a lot of silver

212
00:09:53,779 --> 00:10:00,740
does and turn on again in green for Yoda

213
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,440
and purple for those windy and it's also

214
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:06,140
got an accelerometer speaker and

215
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,330
vibration haptic motor in it so when he

216
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,459
weighs around and hits against things it

217
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,290
probably goes Jewish and clashes just

218
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:17,150
like the light saber toys it's a lot of

219
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:19,099
fun and and so this prosthetic is

220
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,750
completely self-contained you've got the

221
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,279
battery for lights all of the

222
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:27,140
electronics are in the hand and the

223
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:28,910
socket itself and and the hand is

224
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,330
controlled using something called EMG

225
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:35,510
which is electromyography and that works

226
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:38,420
by sensing the electrical impulses from

227
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:40,279
your muscles so your brain tells your

228
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,829
muscles to move down the nerves the

229
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:44,839
muscles fire and then we read that

230
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:48,709
potential difference across the muscle

231
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:51,649
we then amplify it remove a bit of noise

232
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:53,329
do a bit of processing and then can

233
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:55,940
interpret those muscle signals to

234
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:58,699
control the hands so it's quite a simple

235
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,440
system at least in this version in that

236
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,770
we just read two muscles your for our

237
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,500
muscles and so when you bend your wrist

238
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,699
inwards the inner we say the inner for

239
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,379
our muscle and

240
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:11,389
contracts and when you flex your wrist

241
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:14,809
outwards the outer thigh muscle

242
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:16,639
contracts so that's two EMG inputs that

243
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:19,790
we use so you can use that to open and

244
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,259
close the hand and then if you we say

245
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:24,279
double taps if you bend your wrist

246
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:27,109
backwards twice then it will change grip

247
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:29,089
so for example and Logan would be in

248
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:31,519
fistrick where all of the fingers are

249
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:33,290
moving hit double tap and it would

250
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,480
change the pinch so you can do some

251
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,879
finer tasks and he can then double tap

252
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,259
again and go to tripods and all of the

253
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:41,839
grips are completely customizable

254
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:46,429
it's just however they want it will make

255
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:48,439
it and so here he is using I think

256
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:50,419
that's tripod grip playing with a little

257
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:54,498
3d printed statue of himself that we

258
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:57,109
scanned and printed for him this is in

259
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:59,419
fist grip playing with little Star Wars

260
00:11:57,109 --> 00:12:01,730
toys and this is an incredible picture

261
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:04,669
because Logan's never had a right hand

262
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,079
but he's playing with toys in like his

263
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:10,429
body's completely adapted to using a

264
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:12,589
prosthesis and and then so we have this

265
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:15,259
one's fist rip and we also obviously put

266
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:17,569
force choke in it and which he

267
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:18,649
absolutely loved but we have to turn

268
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:22,849
down the power because it kept on

269
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:25,519
killing the guards and and yes you've

270
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,289
got everything in that arm and the aim

271
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,339
for the future arms is to have all of

272
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:33,649
the panels removable and so you could

273
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:36,169
not just have different lightsabers for

274
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:38,509
each day or hour or so you can put on

275
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:41,480
different character arms so for example

276
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:44,480
this is Sydney using the Iron Man arm

277
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:48,079
and and she's also playing with a small

278
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,720
3d printed scan of herself obviously in

279
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,638
the palm there's a repulsor and and as

280
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,160
Sydney opens the hand

281
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,869
the repulsor starts glowing the more

282
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,910
shoot enters the muscle the more it

283
00:12:56,869 --> 00:13:00,619
glows so she can then release and fire

284
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,749
it and that's actually a really

285
00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:04,279
interesting concept that we were trying

286
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:07,459
out because it could be used for

287
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,899
physiotherapy and help increase the

288
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:10,579
nostril mass and stop and wasting away

289
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:12,529
so that's something we're still looking

290
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:17,238
into to see whether it could be a good

291
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:21,230
tool for physicians and so this arm also

292
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:22,459
had Rockets firing out their lights but

293
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,620
when you press the button sort of

294
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:26,750
Rockets would flash it would vibrate and

295
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,620
shoot and make noises so that was a lot

296
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:32,200
of fun to sort of design and create and

297
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:36,440
so here they are looking pretty badass

298
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:38,120
and it was amazing once they put on

299
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,980
these arms they were like running around

300
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,540
showing people I look at my arm look

301
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,420
what I can do I'm gonna four-stroke you

302
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,110
and kill you and and like they weren't

303
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,439
shy about it

304
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,820
it was so typically with Logan's and or

305
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,730
plastic lump that he was wearing earlier

306
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,500
he was a bit shy about it I mean it

307
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,709
wasn't the most aesthetically pleasing

308
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,720
or even funny thing to wear whereas when

309
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:01,819
they're wearing these they were toys as

310
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,649
well as functioning prospect prosthetics

311
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,889
so it's like and they wanted to wear

312
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:09,829
them which is basically a win-win and

313
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:12,170
and so our aim is to produce prosthetics

314
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:13,399
that kids want to wear so imagine

315
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:16,160
turning up to school with one of those

316
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:19,760
as opposed to like the plastic hand from

317
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:23,689
before we've also worked with a few

318
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:27,350
other companies and so this is the Adam

319
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:30,230
Jensen Deus Ex arm from the game I think

320
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:32,510
human Revolution and this is the actual

321
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:35,089
hand from that game so there's

322
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:37,790
characters in the game we have this file

323
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:39,829
we then took that file modified it

324
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:43,279
slightly to put in batteries and motors

325
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:47,239
and the socket and then 3d printed it

326
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:50,600
and for down who you'll see in a minute

327
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:53,750
and then so this is the titan arm which

328
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,120
is a similar arm but more faceted design

329
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,790
and I think it's the shield from the

330
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,640
game and again these renders look pretty

331
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,260
cool but the real things look better so

332
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,110
here we've got down again wearing the

333
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:08,510
jensen on and on the left

334
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:10,819
well my left your right we have these

335
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:13,430
heightened arm and again it's incredible

336
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:15,469
to see how natural these arms look

337
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,699
obviously they're like your eyes are

338
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,670
drawn to them because they're cool

339
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:21,859
designs but they're using them as if

340
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:25,189
they are real hands it's so cool to see

341
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,980
that and and so Katherine actually had

342
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:30,140
quite a traumatic experience growing up

343
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,750
and she was quite shy she'll always hide

344
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:35,050
her arm behind her back but again when

345
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,870
she was wearing this she was going round

346
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:40,089
ring her phone in the prosthetic typing

347
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,200
with her other hand running up to people

348
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:44,740
showing them what she could do with the

349
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:47,080
hand and it was very cool and I think

350
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,690
this next video is the world's first

351
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:52,859
Bionic hand unboxing video

352
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,859
[Music]

353
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:59,139
and it's federally doesn't well because

354
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,949
dad's not even looking at the Hat he

355
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:04,360
could just how casting feedback it by

356
00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:06,310
simply how to feedback to be has a

357
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,110
vibration motors so you can tell if a

358
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:12,550
force limit is reached or if he's

359
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:16,089
changing rip and answer this is Tilly

360
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:18,689
and she's at ten months old I think it

361
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:21,610
was she lost both of her hands due to

362
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:24,490
septicemia from meningitis and so she

363
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,230
had them both amputated and she's

364
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,360
incredible so she's a massive gamer fan

365
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,279
and and wants to become a Bionic

366
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,440
supermodel when she's older which we're

367
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:34,839
going to try and help her out with and

368
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,190
and I've actually gotten off her arm

369
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,279
down here which I forgot to bring on

370
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,279
stage

371
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:02,880
so this is her actual arm that we

372
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:07,289
produced as you can see it's absolutely

373
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:10,230
tiny and I think it's the smallest NotI

374
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:12,299
grip myoelectric ascetic arm has been

375
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,910
produced but I haven't seen many others

376
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:18,929
this size and so you've got the hand

377
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:20,789
which is size match to her other notice

378
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:22,740
about sorry that was Sydney and it was

379
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:26,189
size match to her sister who is of a

380
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:29,780
similar age and and then you've got this

381
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:32,750
socket here and this socket has

382
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:35,940
removable panels for the battery and

383
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:38,250
then it also has the sort of power

384
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:41,010
buttons and all of the EMG electronics

385
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:43,950
for sensing nostril control and it's

386
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:47,730
charged by USB so it's quite quite a

387
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:49,830
cool little device and and so this is

388
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:53,100
Sydney I think it was a minute or two

389
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:55,889
after she put the hand on and it's just

390
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,199
we've never seen anyone throw anything

391
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:00,419
with a prosthetic and that was the first

392
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,950
time she's ever thrown anything because

393
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:06,360
obviously she lost her hands at ten

394
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:08,789
months old and here she is just sort of

395
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,139
doing various object testing just to see

396
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:13,350
get her used to the whole control

397
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:18,840
mechanism but she picked it up

398
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:21,899
incredibly quickly and so her to control

399
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,939
this she's tensing her in a forum to

400
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:28,320
close the hands and then obviously

401
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:30,120
picking up an object and so she's never

402
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,600
been able to interact with those objects

403
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:36,209
in that way before and so yeah she had a

404
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,580
lot of fun and as we were walking back

405
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,350
to the lab and from the sort of filming

406
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,689
area we managed to snap this picture of

407
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,580
her just holding herself as someone

408
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:47,039
would with two hands but no one's taught

409
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,980
her that it's just her body's adapted to

410
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:53,908
the new tool that she's wearing and

411
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:56,789
thought that was comfy and so this is

412
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:59,730
Dan and wearing the DES X arm from

413
00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:02,549
before and his favourite grip is to have

414
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,630
two things including like that and then

415
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:07,720
again Tilly looking about us

416
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:09,550
and so this is our team and back in

417
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,160
Bristol in the UK still quite a small

418
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:14,110
team and but we were very passionate

419
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,820
about making assistive technologies

420
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:21,040
affordable and accessible and so that's

421
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:32,860
it I've been Olly and have you got any

422
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:34,990
questions yes sure yep

423
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,179
so for those of you that were here last

424
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:40,030
year there was a guy called James who

425
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:41,920
and I think he hasn't got anything below

426
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:45,450
the shoulder so we designed the hand

427
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:49,420
that his arm was wearing basically and

428
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:51,880
his arm just had a passive wrist and a

429
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:54,700
passive elbow a passive shoulder because

430
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,530
the higher up the arm you get the more

431
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,740
the stronger motors you need which then

432
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:02,860
adds weight so yeah a full arm is

433
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:04,390
complicated and also the EMG as you said

434
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,699
you can't have that a forearm if you

435
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,620
don't have a forearm so we've used the

436
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,390
shoulder muscles because you've got

437
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:13,949
quite dense grouping of muscles up there

438
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:16,840
that you can put centres on another

439
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:19,060
method is something called targeted

440
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:22,510
targeted nerve reinnervation

441
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:24,639
which simply takes the nerves that would

442
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:26,590
be linking to an arm and then bring them

443
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,650
closer to the server to the surface and

444
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:31,389
then you put EMG electrodes on those

445
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,330
muscles that they're now linked to and

446
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:37,870
then you've got a lot finer control and

447
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:42,129
but as far as how are we developing an

448
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:43,870
arm it's getting there and we so we're

449
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,640
starting at the hand and we've we're

450
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,590
just finalizing our risk development and

451
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,840
then we're going to be go going up to

452
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,730
the elbow then up to the shoulder but

453
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,240
yet at the moment the sort of control

454
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:57,310
system is quite limited and light is

455
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,930
still in experimental phase to have more

456
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:03,730
control did that onto the question or

457
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:06,070
was there anything any other questions

458
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:09,070
sure

459
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,070
therefore

460
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:17,420
yep so the socket has a vibration motor

461
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:21,379
in it similar to that of the smartphone

462
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:24,200
and and you can get the haptic feedback

463
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,790
set up for many different things at the

464
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,870
moment we've just got it on grip change

465
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:32,090
so as before if the user double taps

466
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:33,320
their muscle it will change grip and we

467
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:37,100
can signal that with the haptic

468
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:40,639
vibration motor and you can also use it

469
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:42,409
for force feedback so if a force limit

470
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,770
has been reached so for example if

471
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:48,110
you're grabbing a plastic cup you could

472
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,940
be in a gentle grip mode that will only

473
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,979
apply a certain amount of force and it

474
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:55,250
will vibrate when that force limits been

475
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:57,380
reached and and then you can also use a

476
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,300
different type of haptic feedback which

477
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,700
we've also experimented with which is

478
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,950
like a pressure feedback so think a

479
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:07,220
servo with an arm that presses into your

480
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:09,620
arm when a greater force is detected so

481
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,850
you've got a variable sort of sense of

482
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,530
how much force is being applied at

483
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:15,020
fingers so there's quite a few different

484
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,520
experiments in that field it's just

485
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,740
which ones can be reliable enough and

486
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:25,790
useful enough fine and peachy to want to

487
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:28,370
use it and so the dual channel EMG sort

488
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:30,290
of minutes I mean we were testing it

489
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,149
yesterday I think every single person

490
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:35,090
picked up in like about 30 seconds

491
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,920
because it's simply a flexion and

492
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:39,350
extension of what would be the wrist and

493
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,540
for those that don't have the wrist so

494
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,340
for example in Logan's case he still had

495
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,260
those muscles because he has a forearm

496
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:48,500
and he would actually use those muscles

497
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:51,379
when he was younger to hold some paper

498
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:54,560
while it was coloring in so he knew how

499
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:57,260
to activate those muscles and yeah and

500
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,060
it's once you see the hand moving when

501
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:04,360
your muscle tenses it's very quick to

502
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:04,360
pick up anything else

503
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:26,110
yeah it's a yeah it's so yeah the more

504
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,210
muscles you detect their complicated the

505
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:30,280
control system gets and also the harder

506
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:33,280
is for amputees who don't have fingers

507
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,020
to pick up and learn the system because

508
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,570
if they've never known how to use the

509
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,799
finger how to flex a finger then they

510
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,470
have to basically learn that from

511
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:44,020
scratch as a child would and when

512
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:45,880
they're growing up and there's a few

513
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,158
different technologies for that so

514
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,679
surface EMG which is the stuff we've got

515
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,720
here if you have multiple channels like

516
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,850
multiple sensors you can do some

517
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,120
complicated pattern recognition stuff

518
00:23:54,850 --> 00:24:00,480
that actually angel was experimenting

519
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,908
with with an arm she's been wearing and

520
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,960
but that is very complicated just

521
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:07,809
because you've got so many different

522
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:11,620
sensors a lot of processing and stuff

523
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:15,010
like that so there's also another system

524
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:17,830
that can take lucker and like a

525
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:20,559
ultrasonic it's basically a scan of your

526
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:23,350
arm and it can visually see how muscles

527
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,690
are moving and but then again if an

528
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,980
amputee either has never used those

529
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,890
muscles they're going to be really small

530
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:32,049
and hard to detect and or they're just

531
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:34,539
not going to be able to understand the

532
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:37,629
link from their brain to the muscle so

533
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:39,549
it's the dual channel is easy to

534
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:42,700
implement an easy to pick up but the

535
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:44,440
more sort of metrics you sense the

536
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:49,140
harder it is for the amputee to control

537
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,140
it yes at first yeah

538
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,750
yeah exactly yeah

539
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:10,280
individually

540
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:12,770
yep so that's the so the Decker arm

541
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,539
which is what an Angels doing a trial

542
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:17,750
with at the moment and that does exactly

543
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:20,840
that I think it's six inputs as opposed

544
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:24,559
to our two and and that's different so

545
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:27,678
for our hands we basically got if you

546
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:30,889
bend your wrist and activate this muscle

547
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,830
we then close the hand whereas the DECA

548
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:36,140
hand is you do a motion which ever

549
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:38,928
motion you want and the hand will then

550
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:42,140
look for that motion next time to

551
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:43,250
control the hand so it's less of a yeah

552
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,080
it's just a very different control

553
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:48,530
technique but yeah it's very possible

554
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:58,158
and probably will be and implementable

555
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:58,520
over the next year or so not at the

556
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,070
moment

557
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,590
and we've actually been quite fortunate

558
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:06,649
so I think one of these CEOs from be

559
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:09,020
Bionic and has been very helpful in

560
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:11,809
initially and when we're starting this

561
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,549
project absence a few components but oh

562
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:15,440
you might need these these are expensive

563
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:20,150
take a few of these so they've been

564
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,370
really helpful initially but I'm sort of

565
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:24,710
assuming they were expecting us to fail

566
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:28,399
because it's a very complicated sort of

567
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:29,539
device to create and especially there's

568
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,669
a reason that there's are expensive

569
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:33,408
obviously there's other things to play

570
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:36,140
but the components are expensive the

571
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:38,510
motors are really expensive and carbon

572
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:43,429
fiber the custom carbon fiber socket is

573
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:45,110
expensive and so that there's a reason

574
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:47,900
they're expensive but we just think we

575
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:52,070
can do a few different techniques to

576
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:53,360
make it cheaper and in theory we might

577
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:56,450
not trample on each other's feet too

578
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,270
much and because if people want a super

579
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:01,669
expensive and probably more functional

580
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:02,600
hand than ours because it's metal so

581
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:06,549
it's going to have a bit more strength

582
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:08,539
than our plastic and rubber hands and

583
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:12,049
yes so we haven't had too much

584
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:15,129
resistance yet but I'm sure and yeah

585
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:15,129
there probably will be some

586
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:27,909
so the yes so typically especially for a

587
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:30,189
growing childhood they grow out of their

588
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:33,029
prosthesis about nine to twelve months

589
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:36,130
and which is another reason why and

590
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:37,570
children aren't really able to wear the

591
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,860
more expensive arms because imagine

592
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:42,610
having to pay a hundred thousand pounds

593
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:45,490
every year maybe even twice a year but

594
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:48,158
so for our system it's obviously cheaper

595
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:52,750
and 3d printed and we use a 3d scanner

596
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:55,750
so we after the initial design printing

597
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:57,460
and an implementation of the hands we

598
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,289
then give that to the user when they

599
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,330
feel they're growing out of that hand we

600
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:04,149
ship them a new scanner so just like

601
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:06,490
send it to them and by post they then do

602
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:08,739
a 3d scan themselves send us back the

603
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:11,679
scanner and we just read 3d print the

604
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:15,610
new components and so it's typically a

605
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:17,799
socket and a hand and every yes it would

606
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,570
be a socket say every year or so and a

607
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:21,340
hand maybe every two years three years

608
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:24,580
depending on how quickly they're growing

609
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:26,199
and and so they'll send back their

610
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,029
existing hand we'll take up with

611
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,279
expensive components other motors and

612
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:31,809
the batteries and the electronics put

613
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:33,850
that into the new hand and then ship it

614
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:39,928
back to them just so it gets cheaper the

615
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:39,928
more they use it any other questions I

616
00:28:40,379 --> 00:28:44,110
mean I'm going to be down here for the

617
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:48,090
next ten minutes or so so feel free to

618
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:48,090
put bye Cheers
