1
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:13,950
cool so thanks for coming

2
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,079
so I identify myself as a side work

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,080
because I'm both biologically and

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,209
psychologically United to cybernetics so

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,669
I have a couple of implants in my body

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:28,589
that allow me to expand my senses we are

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,599
my natural ones so in 2013 my body is

8
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:32,668
connected to online seismographs that

9
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,700
allow me to perceive the size negativity

10
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,470
of the planet in real time so every time

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,660
there's an earthquake anywhere in the

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,190
plant and feel a vibration in my arm so

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,410
now I'm hearing nothing but if there's

14
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,809
an earthquake in Japan or in Greece I

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,788
will feel a vibration in my left arm and

16
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,620
depending of the intensity of the

17
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,260
earthquake the duration of whitfill is

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,000
stronger or weaker so at the beginning I

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,699
had to get used to feel all these

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,250
vibrations constantly every day but

21
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,530
after filling all these vibrations after

22
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,539
filling all these motions when these

23
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,940
motions became an emotion it's when I

24
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,460
sell side work it's when I felt that my

25
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,830
organism and cybernetics had united and

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,130
given me a new sense like all the

27
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:18,030
seismic sense and it's making my

28
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,369
existing so we are used to see the world

29
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,470
in this way with the lines of the

30
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,940
continents but on the underneath the

31
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,039
lines of the continents there are the

32
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,740
tectonic plates there are 10 major

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,990
tectonic plates in minor plates and many

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,699
many micro plates and the tectonic

35
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,520
plates are in constant evolution they

36
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,440
constantly evolve they release and

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,289
create tensions they create earthquakes

38
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,390
and all squids are parts of our nature

39
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,870
they have always existed and it's in

40
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,000
them they are very mysterious phenomenon

41
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:50,910
in 2010 my childhood friend Neil

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,610
Harbison Anais created the cyber

43
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:56,429
foundation basically with three aims of

44
00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:01,460
sorts like it's making me by doing

45
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,460
I think like this

46
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,169
hello it's better okay sir so we created

47
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:21,990
the telephone no it's not what do they

48
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:23,850
do I can make it shorter okay so we

49
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,570
created the fire foundation basically we

50
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,790
three aims

51
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,530
one is to help humans to become cyborgs

52
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,079
the other one is to defend the type of

53
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,760
rights like the the freedom to we'll be

54
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,590
able to design yourself and your own

55
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,500
perception and the third one is to

56
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:41,220
promote cyborg art as a as an art and

57
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,950
social movement the work side work work

58
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,200
comes from two words cybernetic organism

59
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,390
and it was created to define humans and

60
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,089
modify themselves in order to survive in

61
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,040
a space but since it was created it has

62
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,160
been used in many different ways and

63
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,739
like all words it keeps evolving but on

64
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,210
the endless definition of this word we

65
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,180
tried to nailed it down in three

66
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,800
different ways of being a cyborg we

67
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,960
think that one could be a psychological

68
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,270
side work which is the feeling of

69
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,760
identifying yourself as a cyborg

70
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,050
maybe most of you are already

71
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,910
psychological side works maybe when you

72
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,800
your mobile phone is running out of

73
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,680
battery instead of saying my mobile

74
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,120
phone is my mobile phone is running out

75
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,820
of battery say I'm running out of

76
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,920
batteries so there's already a

77
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:28,380
connection with technology the other one

78
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,869
could be a biological side work which is

79
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,150
the physical union between cybernetics

80
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,100
and your organism and the third one

81
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,020
could be a neurological side work which

82
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,540
is the modification of the mind to the

83
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,880
union between universes in organism and

84
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,010
cybernetics so if you had a new sense

85
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:48,630
your body and you write constantly you

86
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:51,750
eventually modify your mind also the

87
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:54,299
theory I co-founded cybernetics Levy was

88
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,090
talking about oddity in the other room

89
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,489
and with this company we we offer

90
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,310
sensors already made the several

91
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:04,800
foundation we usually promote the

92
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,019
extension of the sensors but like more

93
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,300
individual way and we think that it's

94
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,709
exciting to think about what you would

95
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,050
like to perceive that you cannot

96
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,900
perceive with your own senses we think

97
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,730
that it's exciting to see what each

98
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,680
individual would like

99
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,530
would like to expand for me it was

100
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,060
important movement maybe someone else

101
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:25,799
would like to perceive something else we

102
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,960
imagine like maybe in 50 years you would

103
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,640
go to a Byron apart from asking like

104
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,430
where you from you would ask what chance

105
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,860
do you have but in Internet we offer the

106
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,350
senses that are already made and the

107
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,990
first one that we offered it's the north

108
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,810
sense which is an implant that can be

109
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,820
anywhere but that we suggested to put it

110
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,850
in the center of the body and it debates

111
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,830
every time you face north so if you wear

112
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,230
these for a long time you eventually

113
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:55,050
gain the sense of orientation and is

114
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:58,820
inspired also like with some sharks and

115
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:01,740
birds can feel also the magnetic north

116
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,800
so I'm a dancer and I'm a movement

117
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,630
researcher since I've been studying

118
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,990
dance I wanted to perceive movement in

119
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:12,240
the deepest way I could and I needed the

120
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,850
technology I could I could do that and

121
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,240
my first experiment that I need it was

122
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:21,330
about the speed as humans we don't have

123
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,100
the sense of the speed so I wanted to to

124
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,780
have my sense of his pace and in order

125
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,910
to do that take it like this kind of

126
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,739
cloth and at which point of people and

127
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:32,160
we tell me the speed of the people

128
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,960
walking in front of me on my glove but I

129
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,450
wasn't that good in articles first of

130
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,930
all I had to point at people and then I

131
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:43,860
I saw them I saw the information on my

132
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:45,780
hand so I had like 5.2 and it was like I

133
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,940
didn't want to know the speed I wanted

134
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,469
to feel the speed I didn't want like to

135
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,719
use the technology I wanted to become

136
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,970
the technology so in order to do that

137
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,590
with a help of a friend we agree we

138
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,900
don't form these in a pair of earrings

139
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,690
and I had like two pair of earrings that

140
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,429
we wait every time someone was walking

141
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,440
in front of me so if someone was walking

142
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,270
from right to left I would feel a

143
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,370
vibration on my right ear and then on my

144
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,140
last year and depending of interval of

145
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,420
each vibration I would know the speed of

146
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,310
the people walking in front of me and

147
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:17,760
that also allow me to perceive movement

148
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,620
in my ass my eyes closed and I did like

149
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,880
a project with that so I realized that

150
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:27,420
there's like a common sense of our how

151
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,670
we walk so you probably walk faster if

152
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,620
you are in London that if you are in

153
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,240
Rome and I found this very

154
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,370
anything that is like these common

155
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,410
movements and so I decided to do a

156
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,710
project of going to each capital of

157
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,760
Europe defining the cities by the speed

158
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,000
of the citizens

159
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,820
so I created like movement dictionary so

160
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,280
and this dictionary for example Paris

161
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:53,820
has the movement quality of the people

162
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,400
in Paris or the London and Rome so I

163
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,070
realized that the fastest city in Europe

164
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,539
is London and the slowest in semantics

165
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:05,180
in cities because basically it's just

166
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,180
one line no one won't no one runs there

167
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,750
after experimenting this for a while I

168
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:12,448
decided to turn around my earrings and

169
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,610
that allowed me to perceive presence

170
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:17,610
behind me and that changed a lot like

171
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:21,660
how experience my my surround is my

172
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:25,110
space awareness and I feel that yeah our

173
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:27,840
senses our focus a lot in the inner in

174
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,699
them in the front of our body but in the

175
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,030
back of our bodies like very dead

176
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:35,070
century talking so this like open like

177
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:37,409
my space awareness and I feel like

178
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:40,080
actually these sense we give the sense

179
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:42,000
to our machines like gosh can can feel

180
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,950
what they have behind them but actually

181
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,320
we don't we don't feel that especially

182
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:49,740
in the in busy cities when a lot of

183
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:52,469
people are trying to go to go fast and

184
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,450
someone blocking you the way I don't

185
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:58,410
know I really find that useful I think

186
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:03,300
we all should have feeling what's behind

187
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:05,910
and after perceiving what we having

188
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,160
moved after lamenting with all these

189
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,590
senses like I wanted to perceive

190
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,780
something more Universal something that

191
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:16,020
didn't depend of people or objects

192
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:18,150
around me and as an answer I guess you

193
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,760
can create movements or you can find

194
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,590
movement and I wanted to find something

195
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,139
like like very interested in finding

196
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:29,010
very in percept imperceptible movement

197
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,810
and I realize that not only humans move

198
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,120
there are many things that move and in

199
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,130
many different ways and the earth is

200
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,839
constantly moving not only rotates but

201
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,088
it shakes that with every day to

202
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,919
earthquakes most of the time it's an

203
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:42,780
imperceptible movement it's an

204
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,670
imperceptible movement it does it but at

205
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,390
the same time is a huge movement then I

206
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,120
thought it would be

207
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,670
amazing to be able to to connect these

208
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,160
bits latch movement to my own body and

209
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:57,810
be connected to the earth through that

210
00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:01,170
way so now that I mean that I feel the

211
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,729
earth constantly I feel like I would way

212
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,959
to describe it it's like having two

213
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:09,420
heartbeats I have my own and my own

214
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:11,580
heartbeat in having the rhythm and then

215
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,380
the earth with like this has its own

216
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,370
rhythm and its own all the time

217
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,689
constantly beating imagery and so and in

218
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,400
the beginning I had to get used to all

219
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,380
these vibrations and sometimes I would

220
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,449
wake up in the middle of the night if

221
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,030
there's a big one so earth can interrupt

222
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:29,310
my daily life sometimes of its pause it

223
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:31,020
is a big one but then I don't know I

224
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:35,010
kind of got used to it

225
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:37,380
and also I realized that actually well I

226
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,330
think it's very different to to know

227
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:43,260
that the earth is moving that to feel it

228
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:45,570
every day how alive is and also I

229
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,880
realized that earthquakes we have these

230
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:50,310
bad impressions of earthquakes are bad

231
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,870
but actually earthquakes it's not the

232
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,359
bad thing the bad thing is that human

233
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,100
time being able to this haven't been

234
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,260
able to adapt to these natural phenomena

235
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,780
because I've always existed but we just

236
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,640
been building our cities ignoring the

237
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:07,589
Dawa planet is a life and constantly

238
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:10,380
moving so I see this as a side work art

239
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:12,360
so I feel that are now artists we didn't

240
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,060
need to use technology as a tool anymore

241
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,680
we can use it as part of our body in

242
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,260
order to create a new sense and then

243
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,660
create artwork from these new saints so

244
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,330
I guess the artwork of a sidewalk artist

245
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,339
would be the creation of a new sense so

246
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:30,150
I feel that my artwork is the seismic

247
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:32,190
sense so this would be my my artwork but

248
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:34,770
is a network that happens inside my body

249
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,630
so I'm the only one in the audience so

250
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,030
in order to share my experience I create

251
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:41,400
external artwork so against I work out

252
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:43,470
has two faces one instigation of these

253
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,840
new scents and then the second phase is

254
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,210
how you share like the artwork that you

255
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,970
create from these new scents so we know

256
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:53,190
that you share my experience I create

257
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:55,710
different artworks and one of them is a

258
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,990
dance piece that I call waiting for

259
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,070
earthquakes when stand still and wait

260
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,800
for an earthquake

261
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:03,930
place and then whenever happens I move

262
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,349
according to the intensity of the

263
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:09,510
earthquake so these fears it's it's it's

264
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,570
a welcoming to the audience just to wait

265
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:16,410
for a while to wait and to listen to the

266
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:18,510
earth and the city is also like a duet

267
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,579
like the earth in this case like the

268
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:23,610
Carrara flow of the piece and I'm just

269
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:30,720
interpretating I'm just an interpreter

270
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:32,880
of the earth core choreography I also

271
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,340
performed this on on the streets this is

272
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,910
in New York with a cube and I remember

273
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:41,010
that night a girl lied down also waiting

274
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:45,589
for earthquakes and a guy entered to the

275
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,590
cube so like people interact with it

276
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:56,370
I also we do sculpture we just like a 3d

277
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,290
replica of my arm and it was a 3d be

278
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,330
Marshall on in the museum and militants

279
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,920
were able to touch the arm and whenever

280
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:04,920
there was an earthquake in real time

281
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,870
they could feel a vibration so my goal

282
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,569
is like a cyborg a sculpture because

283
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,700
it's a sculpture connected to a living

284
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:15,240
organism which is in this case is the

285
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:20,040
earth and my other way to share is it's

286
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:22,320
also with percussion I I played it I

287
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,990
have two ways of doing this one is life

288
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,760
so the rhythm the rhythm of my business

289
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,430
is based on the rhythm of the tectonic

290
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:32,220
plates the one I can do it this life in

291
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:35,699
real time so it's usually very soft

292
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:38,580
pieces but I also create scores based on

293
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,800
some some places to terminate this for

294
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,810
example the first one I did it was in

295
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,609
Mexico and I research all the

296
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:47,400
earthquakes that happen in Mexico in the

297
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:50,520
last 50 years and I put them all in ten

298
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,290
minutes so all the all the rhythm of the

299
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,199
piece was based on the seismic activity

300
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,500
that happened in Mexico in the last 50

301
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,040
years

302
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,780
and I'm gonna do the the last hundred

303
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,930
years of earthquakes in the United

304
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:06,150
States tonight as a performance it's

305
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:09,900
going to be all in ten minutes so it's

306
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:12,510
so it's a way to listen I guess to your

307
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:15,389
country so the first negativity

308
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,860
and this is like an experiment well it's

309
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:20,190
like a project that we did last summer

310
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:23,490
with Neil we went to Brazil and we spent

311
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:26,639
a week with 16 very talented people and

312
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:29,100
we tried to do these prototypes of we

313
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,250
try to do this we did four sentence

314
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,470
lengths of communication we called it

315
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:38,339
Neil and I have a tooth missing in our

316
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:40,440
mouth only has two I have one we created

317
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,630
like these these these are these tooth

318
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,699
that you can put in your mouth

319
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,980
and then whatever I click you feel the

320
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:49,800
vibration and whenever he clicks I feel

321
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,199
a vibration so Neil and I know the Morse

322
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,569
code so we were able to communicate to

323
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:56,699
each other through Morse code so another

324
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:59,339
type to another type of communication to

325
00:13:56,699 --> 00:14:01,740
each other without using air and without

326
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,149
yeah using words so it could be a type

327
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,540
of communication that you could use

328
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:09,300
under the water or in the space and we

329
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:12,420
need we need this performance in Brazil

330
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,849
so I wasn't at the end of a table and me

331
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:18,329
was in the other end of the table and we

332
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:20,339
had some some words and then the

333
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:22,260
audience would choose the word and I

334
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:25,639
would send it to Neil and you would pick

335
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,639
up the words and the other way around

336
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:32,610
so now that I'm I feel I've been feeling

337
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:34,680
earthquakes for a while and and identify

338
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,600
myself as a side work actually I don't

339
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,899
feel closer to Robert with the machines

340
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,209
I feel closer to nature unto all animals

341
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:45,060
living in this planet I can feel closer

342
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:46,920
to to my planet because I can feel the

343
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,839
deteriorating constantly and also feel

344
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,389
closer to other animals patients because

345
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,279
they can perceive also earthquakes in in

346
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:55,050
a different way and I really believe

347
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,360
that we can learn so much from other

348
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:59,910
animal species living in our planet

349
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,010
because sometimes when when we think

350
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,800
something something is very science

351
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:06,899
fiction or very unnatural is actually

352
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,540
very natural because if we look in other

353
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:12,360
animal species we will realize that I

354
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:14,699
mean other animals can can fly some

355
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,040
animals can create life some animals can

356
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:19,589
perceive ultraviolet or infrared and

357
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,300
even immortality already exist in nature

358
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:25,350
because there's a jellyfish that never

359
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:26,459
dies so I think that if we can I mean I

360
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,650
feel that we can

361
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:32,250
to admire others other animal species

362
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:35,250
and if we take some of their senses and

363
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:38,340
apply to our body our way of perceiving

364
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:40,350
the planet we change and so will and so

365
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:46,110
will our understand of the planet of the

366
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:48,450
planet and our behavior in a breath so I

367
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:51,090
feel that maybe in this century rather

368
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:53,190
than giving new sensors to to our

369
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:55,110
machines and to our carts and to our

370
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:57,570
phones we can give new sensors to

371
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:00,150
ourselves and to other bodies maybe

372
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:03,210
instead of keep changing the environment

373
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:06,480
it's time to change ourselves in order

374
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:09,990
to live more according to our planet so

375
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,900
for example if we take a look at light

376
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:15,720
for example we haven't developed night

377
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:19,380
visions like some other species have so

378
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,480
maybe maybe it would be more logical to

379
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,730
create night vision instead of creating

380
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,130
all these certification life again if

381
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:30,180
anyone who had invented the night vision

382
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:32,490
set of the light bob with we still be

383
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:35,790
able to see the stars at night and the

384
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:38,040
official light created by athletes

385
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:42,089
creating so much pollution and energy

386
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:45,300
ways that it's damaging our planet also

387
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:48,930
I think the word side work was also

388
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:51,839
created to extend the human experience

389
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,939
and it also said that it would free the

390
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,530
men to explore and I think humans are

391
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,710
natural explorers and people that

392
00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:00,689
evolved and actually my aim this year is

393
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:03,900
to reconnect it to the seismic activity

394
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:08,070
on the moon to fill the full moon the

395
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:09,569
moon quakes so this will allow me to be

396
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,339
against it the two places at the same

397
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:13,319
time and I want these new sends on my

398
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:16,349
feet so this will allow me to be

399
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:20,069
physically on earth but have my feet but

400
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:24,149
feel have my feet on the moon we feel

401
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:26,399
that we can all expand our senses to two

402
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:29,040
space like our senses no longer needs to

403
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,230
be attached to our own body if we use

404
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,629
Internet as a sense we can feel things

405
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,220
that are happening very far from us like

406
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,350
I can feel this goods are happening in

407
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,670
the other side of the planet but we can

408
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,260
also feel things that are happening

409
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:43,320
outside this flat

410
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,840
and space so we can all become maybe

411
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,210
sensor notes and management we can be

412
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,629
physically on earth but that we can send

413
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:55,770
our senses on space and express an extra

414
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:58,740
space with new senses so to finish and

415
00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:01,170
everything that we are the ones who need

416
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,320
who need to make sure that the union

417
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:06,480
between humans and technology does not

418
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,580
alienate us from nature but instead

419
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:17,660
bring us closer to it to other animals

420
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:21,060
and the space thank you Jason Barnes

421
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:25,260
from Atlanta Georgia so a little bit

422
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:27,179
about myself I'm 27 years old been a

423
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,610
musician pretty much my whole life since

424
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:33,270
I was about 12 years old grew up playing

425
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,889
guitar drums etc etc when I was 22 I was

426
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,830
involved in electrical accident at work

427
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:39,870
which ultimately resulted in me being

428
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,280
hospitalized for over a month and during

429
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,739
multiple surgeries and eventually

430
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,930
amputating my right hand now since all

431
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,180
of this happened again like I said I was

432
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,250
a musician before so it kind of

433
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,720
completely devastated me made me

434
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,400
extremely good price and I didn't really

435
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,750
know how it would go on and that was

436
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,450
around the time that I kind of started

437
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,340
getting into all of this like modern-day

438
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,060
tech implantable taking adult technology

439
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,550
and things like that

440
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:05,790
so shortly after I was released from the

441
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:08,430
hospital I started trying to find a way

442
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:10,350
to get my sanity back and be able to

443
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:13,650
play drums again so I started trying to

444
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:15,419
co-develop a drumming prosthesis non

445
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,610
robotic it just kind of works off basic

446
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:20,970
mechanics in a spring to give me my

447
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:22,889
ability to play drums again so I have a

448
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:28,700
short video here kind of demonstrating

449
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:28,700
how that works big

450
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:48,610
so essentially how it works is I don't

451
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,729
know if it's kind of blurry to you guys

452
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:53,979
let's clear me there's a spring the

453
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:56,650
point my risk that has a millimeter of

454
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,330
play in it affliction and then also have

455
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,070
a spring that came off of a kick drum so

456
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,020
what it does that allows me to hit the

457
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,178
drum and I can either leave it and get

458
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,929
bounces or pull it away for a single

459
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:10,030
stroke after I developed this arm I

460
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:12,700
started kind of going down the road of

461
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:15,190
all this technology stuff and I had this

462
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,960
idea of developing a robotic drumming

463
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:19,299
prosthesis which works the exact same

464
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,640
way that these do which is via EMG so

465
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:24,040
essentially I could flex this muscle the

466
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,950
hand closes flex this muscle and opens

467
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,570
the drum arm that I designed essentially

468
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,919
work the same way so I could flex the

469
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,540
muscle and it would tighten the grip on

470
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,140
the stake or flex the outer muscle and

471
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:36,610
it would loosen the grip on a stick I

472
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,230
had no knowledge of any of this type of

473
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,120
technology nor prosthetics or anything

474
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,799
like that and thought that this was kind

475
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,209
of a far-fetched idea and I wasn't going

476
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:45,600
to go anywhere

477
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,679
long story short one of my teachers

478
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,629
mentioned the idea to one of his private

479
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,460
students who happen to be a student in

480
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,110
Georgia Tech and mentioned a one of his

481
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,750
professors and since then we started

482
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:59,740
kind of Co developing this robotic arm

483
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:06,510
and multiple other musical robots so we

484
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:06,510
have robots named shamone pull this up

485
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,850
which essentially

486
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,320
okay there we go

487
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:31,080
so yeah what we've done with shamone

488
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:33,149
here is we've basically implanted music

489
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,389
theory from different jazz musicians you

490
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:37,049
know Miles Davis Coltrane etc etc and so

491
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,020
the robot

492
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:42,600
when you turn it on it has eyes it has

493
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,309
ears it listens to any musician whether

494
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,189
it be guitar or drums or anything like

495
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:48,059
that and it has beat detection so it

496
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,950
could listen to the music

497
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:51,178
eventually gather the beat start bobbing

498
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,679
its head and that also has pitch

499
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:54,510
detection so I can determine whether or

500
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,000
not you know I'm playing jazz type music

501
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:59,850
or country or rap whatever you know

502
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,840
whatever you like and so it actually

503
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:06,439
improvises in real-time with using the

504
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,928
brain of again those jazz musicians

505
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:13,440
which kind of creates a whole new aspect

506
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:15,570
to music and things like that it creates

507
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,850
a lot of interactions you wouldn't

508
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:22,860
normally have but without this kind of

509
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:24,209
stuff and so I saw his videos and then

510
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,939
contacted him and then we started

511
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:30,299
working on this robotic drum arm and

512
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,429
essentially how it works is the EMG and

513
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:35,250
then the second stick uses kind of the

514
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:36,840
same algorithms as Schiavone does and it

515
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,940
has an accelerometer on the arm so I can

516
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,230
flip the arm out as soon as I throw it

517
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,429
up in the air the second stick can come

518
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,559
out and then I can start playing with a

519
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:45,570
second stick and it improvises the same

520
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:48,270
way it listens to the music gathers beat

521
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:50,279
detection etc etc and then will throw

522
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,980
its own accompaniment a company name to

523
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,809
it sometimes frustrating sometimes

524
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,520
pretty interesting again this is just

525
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:59,460
like a robot with a mind of its own and

526
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:04,610
I'm sitting here jamming with so uh the

527
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,610
outcomes are obvious Carl did I miss

528
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:10,850
so if I seem a little unprepared guys

529
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:14,179
I've had a technical issues all weekend

530
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:15,500
and luckily my friend oli let me use his

531
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,040
computer so I can pull up some of the

532
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,040
stuff you guys

533
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:46,260
so here's a here's a video that kind of

534
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:51,000
explains what we do in Georgia take a

535
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:53,129
little bit better like I said I don't

536
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,680
have my computer or any of my stuff on

537
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,680
so this is all kind of

538
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:07,970
I guess you guys probably can hear it

539
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,150
so there's two sticks each stick can

540
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,949
play it's a combined 20 hits per second

541
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:25,500
so again that I think the fastest human

542
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:27,920
speed is like 10 or 11 is per second so

543
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,920
it creates

544
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,200
[Music]

545
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,620
so again sounds like you wouldn't

546
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:22,010
normally be able to do you know other

547
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,010
humanly possible

548
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,120
Oh

549
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:42,430
trying to pull the video I was just

550
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,430
explaining to

551
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:15,770
arrearage in his lab he and his team are

552
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,410
trying to develop robots able not only

553
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:23,560
to faithfully recreate songs but also to

554
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:26,930
show creativity and improvise ngy Berg

555
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:34,070
and I look for robots to inspire me

556
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:36,620
musically if I can create an algorithm

557
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:40,810
that creates new music that is

558
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,810
meaningful for people this is creative

559
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:46,850
for me cause very interesting to get to

560
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,739
the cove understanding and then musical

561
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:52,429
creation and musical creativity aspect

562
00:26:48,740 --> 00:27:01,400
is to program this algorithm into a body

563
00:26:52,430 --> 00:27:03,290
I think Robert is a great way to explore

564
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,110
what's the music creation aspect is

565
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:08,300
about because it has a little brain and

566
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:10,189
it has the body that can provide the

567
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,810
visual cues acoustic sound and what we

568
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,580
call embodiment the understanding that

569
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:16,010
you have a body in which you create

570
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,120
music in but is that other musician will

571
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:29,740
respond to

572
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:29,739
[Music]

573
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,100
in our case we have robots it has eight

574
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:38,110
arms it knows it has eight arms

575
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,360
it knows that if you wants to play

576
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:42,639
something really really fast on one side

577
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,409
not all eight arms can convert together

578
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,300
those will collide with each other so as

579
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:48,400
to come up with ideas that actually it

580
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,080
can play to come up with something that

581
00:27:48,400 --> 00:28:03,340
is not only beautiful but also doable

582
00:27:50,080 --> 00:28:08,949
physically we worked on Simon for eight

583
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:11,439
years now Shimon can decide what's

584
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:13,300
interesting for him and if it's

585
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,970
interesting it would look at you it will

586
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:18,280
maybe squint at you infiltrate to note

587
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:21,220
that with approval and just playing with

588
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:34,000
that robot le good job it's a weird an

589
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:35,590
interesting and fun experience even

590
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,880
though I programmed it and I put the

591
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,889
numbers and I know exactly how much

592
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,390
percentage of each musical element

593
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:43,540
suddenly something came back that was

594
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:45,430
awesome that was beautiful you know the

595
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,230
idea is that it will send shivers down

596
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:49,270
your spine and I'll make you cry or

597
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,800
because if you do that you know that you

598
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,230
created something good so I didn't cry

599
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,180
yet but there was moments that really

600
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,770
were interesting for me and we're trying

601
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,890
to make these moments coming again and

602

going to replace musicians

sophisticated brain wise and body wise

think about music differently to make me

way that I would never to respond to

check marks and maybe then I will start

660
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:19,760
this kind of embedded wearable devices

661
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:23,059
maybe even implantable in in the future

662
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:27,379
I don't know and can actually enhance

663
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:29,420
their creativity they're not a particle

664
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:31,640
we are God as a team wanting to the

665
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,650
other time a revolutionary smart arm

666
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,540
prototype controlled by thought

667
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:39,100
essentially how it works

668
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:41,928
EEG and there's what we also use like

669
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:43,659
connects from Xbox and so it has a

670
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:46,190
camera in front of the drumset and

671
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:48,830
depending on where you look or where

672
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:51,620
your body is the third arm again will

673
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:54,020
play where it thinks it needs to still

674
00:32:51,620 --> 00:33:00,320
in the works basic technology here or a

675
00:32:54,020 --> 00:33:04,120
basic but you notice where the timing

676
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:07,179
looks so they always drum the arm

677
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,179
[Music]

678
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:23,179
yeah so again these are all prototypes

679
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:25,549
that we've been working on since then I

680
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:27,799
recently started getting involved in the

681
00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:33,559
electronic music world and kind of had

682
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:34,970
these ideas of building an arm so for

683
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:37,610
live performances already use this hand

684
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:40,700
DJ but also have a lot of other gadgets

685
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,149
on it so I have a fireball shooter if

686
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,679
you will

687
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:44,748
developed that I'm trying to get

688
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:46,610
implanted into the arm and also other

689
00:33:44,749 --> 00:33:47,929
sound activated neon lights and stuff so

690
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,580
they actually will pick up pulse from

691
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:52,190
bass and music and then react

692
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:53,029
accordingly also doing some kind of

693
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,379
experiments again with the

694
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:56,779
accelerometers and stuff like that on

695
00:33:54,379 --> 00:34:04,009
how to control when the fireballs shoot

696
00:33:56,779 --> 00:34:07,809
out etc etc yeah any questions guys for

697
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:07,809
your moon as well all I got free

698
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:30,139
[Music]

699
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:38,820
slightly but not not enough slightly

700
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,890
yeah

701
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:56,099
you're talking with like a

702
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:56,099
motion-capture glove there

703
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:13,299
oh yeah yeah exactly are you talking

704
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:13,810
about now yeah yeah I mean the options

705
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,980
are endless

706
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:19,779
so how the EEG works is that it's

707
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,950
essentially from him looking it said

708
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,720
that's that's where most of that's

709
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:25,180
coming from and then his eye movement as

710
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,410
well as worth picking up so me EEG is

711
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,609
not very accurate we all know it just

712
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:30,250
kind of picks up the electrical signals

713
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:32,348
so you can only get so much data from

714
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:34,599
that but that's essentially how they are

715
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:40,720
works is it's through EEG and then to

716
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:42,550
connect camera slightly look well the

717
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,368
Kinect doesn't know exactly does with

718
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:46,660
his eyes and stuff either so anytime so

719
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:49,510
like when I when I did stays with the

720
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:51,339
EEG at Georgia Tech to try and use EEG

721
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:54,160
to control the drum arm based on thought

722
00:35:51,339 --> 00:35:55,180
and stuff essentially we kind of had the

723
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,690
same thing there's just not enough

724
00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:05,848
valuable data there to create

725
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:05,849
something's left like viable no emails

726
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:24,779
um pretty far away I mean that's that's

727
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,259
in the realm of artificial intelligence

728
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:29,670
and stuff like that so again where we're

729
00:36:28,259 --> 00:36:30,839
at we're not trying to replace musicians

730
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:33,269
or anything like that we're just trying

731
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:36,449
to create something new here so kind of

732
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:39,209
a hard question to answer there no it

733
00:36:36,449 --> 00:36:42,449
was developed it looks like using clay

734
00:36:39,209 --> 00:36:44,160
to slightly slightly improvise and stuff

735
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:45,959
but again the artificial intelligence

736
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,569
may that's something like we programmed

737
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:50,459
and stuff so it thinks a certain way and

738
00:36:48,569 --> 00:36:52,199
it improvises that but it still is only

739
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:53,489
going to think I need Spacek guidelines

740
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:55,529
you know I mean I can't go outside of

741
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:56,640
the box at all stuff we're working on

742
00:36:55,529 --> 00:36:57,749
you know with machine learning and stuff

743
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,249
like that but we're not really having

744
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:01,249
any good results right now

745
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,919
not not necessarily so if you were to

746
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:10,419
play like a 20 minute long piece it

747
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,609
would listen to the piece and I mean you

748
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:14,050
could call it fusion you know change the

749
00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:16,299
styles of music throughout and it would

750
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:18,280
it would kind of learn but again it

751
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:24,400
still just based off its own code that

752
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:29,380
you know that we wrote into it the drum

753
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:31,599
stuff or yeah you eat there's a couple

754
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:34,150
of the cyborg drum stuff on on YouTube

755
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,619
and I think on the shamone robot website

756
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:37,390
they have some clips and stuff on there

757
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:40,780
we have like a couple original pieces

758
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:44,200
that we were over Georgia taken tonight

759
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:45,430
now so I'm just DJing again I've had so

760
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:53,939
many technical difficulties before I

761
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:56,529
even came that should go well not yet

762
00:37:53,940 --> 00:38:01,380
not yet broken phone broken computer

763
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:01,380
berthing Kleman machine God hates me

764
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:33,640
I don't know I think we were very very

765
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:38,410
plastic and can adapt very easily to new

766
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:40,690
input but for me I see this as an

767
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:43,899
evolution so I started with something

768
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:46,510
and it keeps evolving and now for me to

769
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:48,550
see something in the space and maybe if

770
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:51,880
I'm really into them on quite well I

771
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:54,580
would leave to pursue or I don't know

772
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,650
but I will say for me it's like it's

773
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:59,650
pretty mental and evolving so if I say

774
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:04,170
it's too much then maybe I'll keep going

775
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:06,730
for another on one I guess everyone is

776
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:08,550
it's different it's like how many

777
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:11,260
languages can you learn or how many

778
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:15,970
things that you able to learn like I

779
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:18,130
have no idea I guess it's a lot we can

780
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:20,520
learn a lot we have so much brain as we

781
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,520
don't use

782
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:34,909
thank you thanks guys

783
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:34,909
[Applause]
