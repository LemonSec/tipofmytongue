1
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,759
welcome everyone to the

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,219
six panel today we're going to talk

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,660
about things that we shouldn't do

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,930
perhaps or maybe things that we should

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,080
do and I'm just gonna do a quick

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,099
introduction but first no biological

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,509
modifications you know whether they be

8
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:31,040
cosmetic therapeutic augmentative they

9
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:34,430
are increasingly becoming a part of our

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,600
reality and often faster than we have a

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,760
chance to think through the implications

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,250
both as a society and you know both in

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,690
terms of our institutions our objective

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,879
today with the time that we've been

15
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,769
allowed is to think through and share

16
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,079
some of the ethical considerations about

17
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:49,608
the many complex and often heated issues

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,170
that are involved and as always we'll

19
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:53,420
open the floor to questions once we've

20
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,519
had our conversation so let me just

21

and a guest today on the panel we had a

64
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,610
unfortunate cancellation but Amol Griff

65
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,230
struck

66
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:39,860
sorry a concept incorrectly closed

67
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,429
matter frustum has graciously decided to

68
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,770
help us out today

69
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,480
Amol has a long history with technology

70
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,610
it's got two small RFID transponders

71
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,440
implanted onto one into each of his

72
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,940
hands and he uses them to open doors

73
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,450
start his vehicles and log on to his

74
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,070
computer

75
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,679
since implanting himself he has written

76
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,180
a book called RFID toys become a TEDx

77
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,280
speaker has made numerous media

78
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,040
appearances and is the subject of

79
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,410
documentaries my name is George divorce

80
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,480
ki I'm a science writer and a futurist I

81
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:08,140
work at Gizmodo you can find some of my

82
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,310
writings most of an ethicist

83
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,109
bioethicists at the Institute for ethics

84
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,400
and emerging technologies where we do

85
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,430
just that we consider the ethical

86
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,380
implications of both the current

87
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,980
technical technological developments and

88
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:24,109
those that appear on the horizon ok now

89
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,780
a number of years ago I attended a

90
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,130
transhumanist themed conference and we

91
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,820
talked about all the while the wonderful

92
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:33,680
things that we're going to do to our

93
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:35,390
brains into our bodies and we and we had

94
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,560
an ethics panel much like this one of

95
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:40,700
which I took part and after the

96
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,750
discussion I looked through that my

97
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,119
Twitter feed to see what the

98
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,940
back-channel conversation was like and

99
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,970
we literally had a conversation which

100
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,650
went roughly like this why the hell do

101
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:55,270
we even have bioethicists at a

102
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:57,740
transhumanist conference with that

103
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,840
statement in mind and I would actually

104
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,390
like to throw that at the panel Victoria

105
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,310
like to start with you why are we even

106
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,230
here why I mean I imagine everyone here

107
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,530
obviously I get a show of hands who here

108
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:14,600
is in some way shape or form in favor of

109
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:16,700
some kind of biohacking ok so are we is

110
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,548
this a nuisance that we're here or are

111
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,170
you glad that we are here Victoria

112
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:23,090
that's good thank you very much for

113
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,370
doing me time to think that is something

114
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:29,450
very good I like that good nice good

115
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:32,210
moderator yes absolutely I'm a logger

116
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:34,580
but all law really starts from some

117
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,770
aspects of ethics we really have to

118
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,229
first have some kind of norm that we

119
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,159
want to create a rule of law around so

120
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:42,080
of

121
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,780
an ethic standpoint if we don't have

122
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,030
some norms to start with we can very

123
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,219
quickly go off track and have something

124
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:52,460
that maybe is completely rejected and

125
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,500
eventually by society so we do need a

126
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:58,190
code of ethics because we need to think

127
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,530
about what is a good norm a norm meaning

128
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,660
what is a value of standard value that

129
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,880
we want to have and if you are in the

130
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,890
last lecture for example you heard there

131
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,690
were some norms like your device should

132
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,150
always do what the owner wants that's a

133
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:14,810
norm you might say that might be a good

134
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:17,030
norm for body acting for a device as

135
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:20,570
well make sure the device always does

136
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:22,429
what the owner wants so if we don't

137
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,099
start out with an ethic like that we

138
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:28,010
could very quickly go off track and end

139
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:31,370
up really harming a good possibility to

140
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:34,250
enhance our lives by ending up having it

141
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,980
rejected or delayed getting into a

142
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:40,460
mainstream kind of thinking and as long

143
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:43,510
as we keep some norms around this we can

144
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:47,120
probably maximize its value for society

145
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,380
John you do work in ethics obviously why

146
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,780
do you feel it's important that you be

147
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:54,320
at a conference like this well so the

148
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:56,229
way I approach a conference like this or

149
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,230
actually any sort of discussion of

150
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:02,150
technology emerging or otherwise is

151
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:05,030
based on just a couple of fairly simple

152
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:10,250
principles so if we look at for example

153
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:12,380
this cup of water one of the things we

154
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,590
can understand about technologies is

155
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,900
that the values that they embody are

156
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:21,619
built into them and so in this

157
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:23,989
particular case this is a glass of water

158
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:28,430
I'm going to talk about the cup not the

159
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:34,400
water the cup is life that's transparent

160
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:39,169
it's it's inexpensive when I'm finished

161
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:41,719
I will throw it away possibly in a

162
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:45,650
recycle bin but possibly not and so

163
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,390
these values both can be positive and

164
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,669
negative that are embodied in the

165
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,159
technology they're designed in they live

166
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:53,840
so to speak inside this technological

167
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,840
design

168
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:01,280
same thing with the whole body hacking

169
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:03,820
endeavor the the downside of my cup is

170
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,469
is is that it's going to create a

171
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:09,770
potential pollution problem among other

172
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:12,520
things and so then we have to invent new

173
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:16,810
technologies procedures and indeed laws

174
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:20,950
to regulate the downside of technologies

175
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:23,210
for example developing recycle bins and

176
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:25,969
arranging for their collection and

177
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,580
disposal and perhaps redistribution and

178
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:32,870
so forth so one of the reasons I'm here

179
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:35,510
is to not just to explore the positive

180
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:38,450
values that are associated with the body

181
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:41,750
hacking endeavor but also so that we're

182
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:45,139
not naive in moving forward as as mister

183
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:48,590
dr. o I think very vividly Illustrated

184
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:50,510
so that we can then go forward being

185
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,909
fully informed and knowing what we're

186
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:55,070
getting into sure did you have anything

187
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,900
- well I'm trained in clinical ethics so

188
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,849
I think of things as mostly like is this

189
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,500
medically appropriate when I think of

190
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,850
adopting new technology so I think of

191
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,800
conferences like this as an opportunity

192
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:06,289
for me to learn more about kind of

193
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,080
technologies and why they're adopted if

194
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:11,180
it's not and explicitly or exclusively

195
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,890
medically appropriate technology to be

196
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,870
using so I think it's important to kind

197
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,219
of learn both sides so that I understand

198
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,880
the pros and the cons of adopting such a

199
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:22,460
technology from a by hacking perspective

200
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,409
I think a lot about hackers look at at

201
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,810
the system ethics boards like a

202
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,820
potential roadblock and I mean that's

203
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,710
why the conversation on the back-channel

204
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:34,610
was started out that way right why are

205
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:36,860
they here you know we we kind of come to

206
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,120
the to the industry as it were and very

207
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,520
nascent but it is an industry that's

208
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,099
growing but we come to it as a kind of

209
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,800
explorers right and so like well you

210
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:47,900
were exploring the ethical aspects of

211
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,240
where technology's going what it's

212
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,709
capable of what it's not we're we're

213
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,170
also trying to explore that within our

214
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:57,920
own body so I think it's important to to

215
00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:01,250
involve ethics and ethicists in in the

216
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,449
endeavours because it invariably that's

217
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,190
where humans are headed we've we've

218
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,540
always been tool users you know we'll

219
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,860
continue to be tool users they're going

220
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,319
to get smaller smarter

221
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,910
and more invasive so it's good that

222
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,880
we're here having this conversation

223
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:15,170
before we get into some of the

224
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,270
nitty-gritty I think it's important that

225
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,540
we maybe take a step back for a second

226
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,640
here

227
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,189
and even ask ourselves a very important

228
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,830
question which is why are we even going

229
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,120
about biohacking why are we even talking

230
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,340
or even thinking about this and in

231
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,770
actually engaging in it I mean aren't

232
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,810
our bodies and our minds good enough I

233
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,910
mean in their present state in terms

234
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,619
what's naturally been given to us and

235
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,150
shouldn't we be content with what we

236
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,390
have are we just being selfish we just

237
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:43,459
being maybe was it far too experimental

238
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,780
and do we risk for example kind of

239
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,670
undermining what it means to be human

240
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:49,610
what it means to be an X so called

241
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,630
natural state and I would like share it

242
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,920
actually open up but because I know

243
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,870
you've done some work in transhumanism

244
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,160
which is the kind of that that ethos

245
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,720
that kind of celebrates that notion that

246
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,329
we actually probably should move beyond

247
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,530
our latent human capacities so I think

248
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,180
there's some technologies like I

249
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:04,550
personally wear contact lenses and that

250
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,839
is kind of a survival point for me like

251
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,969
if I'm blind I'm not going to be able to

252
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,350
drive or kind of survive at any point in

253
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,060
my life because I'm blind

254
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,530
so I think contact lenses and things

255
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,329
like that kind of give us an advantage

256
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:16,100
as human beings so that we can survive I

257
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,960
got the kind of baseline that we're

258
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,400
supposed to be at I guess although

259
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,510
evolution would kind of say like if you

260
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,670
don't have good vision just supposed to

261
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,990
die out but I don't want to die out so

262
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,490
I'm going to use contact lenses but I

263
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,170
think there's also a point of like

264
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,390
contact lenses that kind of have cameras

265
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,979
embedded in them and that gives you like

266
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,360
an opportunity to take pictures of

267
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,740
somebody without their consent so I

268
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,570
think that's kind of a point where

269
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,120
you're breaching somebody else's

270
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,590
opportunity to have like a good like

271
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,130
baseline life where they're not being

272
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:45,590
breached on and was upon I guess right

273
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:47,689
you've actually modified yourself why

274
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:50,210
why do you feel you had to do that um

275
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,590
that's the impulse there well let's

276
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,900
start with the definition of

277
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:57,170
transhumanism which is my definition of

278
00:10:53,900 --> 00:11:00,220
international fundamental group that's

279
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:02,839
trying to change the human condition so

280
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,830
and bio hacking hacking having a

281
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,080
negative connotation

282
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:08,270
my definition of hacking is simply that

283
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,430
it's an alternative or non-conventional

284
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:12,890
approach to problem solving or achieving

285
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,390
a goal so a good hack is going to turn

286
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,000
conventional because more efficient or

287
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:19,520
better and so the idea that there's a

288
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,740
natural human state is a farce

289
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,050
we've been evolving and things have been

290
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,940
progressing from forever there is no you

291
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,880
know this is a human boom and that's it

292
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,950
in a box you know the use of contact

293
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,350
lenses and all that these are tools that

294
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,690
we've used and we're not outside of the

295
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:38,990
animal kingdom we're part of it so our

296
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,700
brains are enabling us evolutionarily to

297
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,500
use these tools and survive and it's all

298
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,510
part of the same matrix it's not it's

299
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,160
not something that's special but the

300
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,830
drive the human drive to improve

301
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,689
ourselves and and to explore curiosity

302
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:52,610
all of those things are what make us

303
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,010
human and this is nothing different I

304
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:58,430
mean what I've done is nothing that

305
00:11:55,010 --> 00:12:00,770
outrageous but some people have this

306
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,630
idea of the skin being a sacred barrier

307
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:05,930
and you know if we put something under

308
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:07,670
it's somehow different and weird you

309
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,649
mind my drive is simply to improve

310
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:12,380
myself to be able to give myself better

311
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:14,300
capabilities in medicine it's about

312
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:17,600
typically restorative technologies

313
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,699
giving back to a normal but why why not

314
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,830
go further and that we've already seen

315
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,649
seen it in medical industry like Oscar

316
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:26,240
Pistorius you know has the Blade Runner

317
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:26,860
legs and before he started shooting up

318
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,750
the place

319
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,740
he ran any regular Olympics and it was

320
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,649
argued that he had an unfair advantage

321
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,839
for you know evolutionarily speaking in

322
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:39,440
that environment the Olympics running

323
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,260
you might have had an advantage so the

324
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,579
idea of ethics is becoming critical

325
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,520
because we're seeing this these

326
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:49,339
different microcosms of society have

327
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,439
different reactions and so you know if

328
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:53,029
we're going to talk about humanity as a

329
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,980
whole and the effects that's going to

330
00:12:53,029 --> 00:13:01,040
have on us it's important to discuss

331
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:03,640
yeah well I see two different ideas

332
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,260
emerging here one of them is the

333
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,899
enhancement side of body hacking the

334
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:10,279
other one is a new feature that you

335
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:12,520
haven't had and I think you said that

336
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:18,200
I'm just saying it and kind of is

337
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:19,490
another way maybe but why is one seem

338
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:24,670
differently than the other one for

339
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:27,079
example in enhancement you might have

340
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,670
let's say cognitive enhancement there's

341
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:32,060
a lot of controversy about that now

342
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:33,270
cognitive enhancement for undergrads you

343
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,890
know the first

344
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,560
riddlin and there was a drawl and now

345
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,240
there's a next-generation drug which is

346
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:44,010
was accident that's it our Murdock yeah

347
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:47,750
yes and and this has gone so far as to

348
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:51,420
have some universities have policies

349
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:54,570
against use of cognitive enhancement now

350
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,880
why would we why would we want to stop

351
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,620
that there are a couple of that there

352
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,270
are a couple of schools of thought there

353
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,040
one of them is well only bridge kids

354
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:04,860
will get it so that's an unfair

355
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:08,819
advantage it's an equity issue the other

356
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:11,880
issue is but it is just unnatural now

357
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,010
why she you shouldn't use you say and it

358
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,850
had cognitive enhancement you should use

359
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:19,970
your natural self does anyone finding

360
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:23,010
either of those arguments really

361
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,600
showstoppers for cognitive enhancement I

362
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:27,420
don't think so I think there are ways to

363
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,710
cope with both of those areas but some

364
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,380
schools see this as a showstopper

365
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,210
shouldn't be done and I think that's

366
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,580
something we need to really have a

367
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:38,190
conversation about because this is going

368
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,080
to get just more controversial this

369
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,300
isn't stopping or leveling out I think

370
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,910
we're just going to see more and more of

371
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:49,439
this cognitive enhancement continue and

372
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:51,150
whether we want to use this and there

373
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,620
are downsides to it too as you know

374
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,970
they're they're downside to using

375
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:58,530
cognitive enhancers for pride repair

376
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,850
grads who are still using it through

377
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:03,420
graduate school like every on eight

378
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:05,550
years now going on eight years are these

379
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,290
things that we want to try to find ways

380
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:10,170
to deal with or do we want to stop it

381
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:13,020
and I think stopping is just is that's

382
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:15,180
just not going to happen that other line

383
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:17,730
of thinking that adding a feature you

384
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,589
don't have like the RFID chip where you

385
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,620
can do something that you normally

386
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,670
wouldn't do as a human is that seeing

387
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,040
any differently

388
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,540
should it be seen differently should

389
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,349
enhancement be something different

390
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:35,099
ethically than an added feature to human

391
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:39,420
human censorial ability or or function

392
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,770
okay John you do work in psychiatry you

393
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,839
know you know a thing or two about how

394
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:45,449
the brain works we're not good enough I

395
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,130
mean our bodies and brains are well not

396
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:49,050
well so the

397
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:51,180
the way I think about transhumanism

398
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:53,339
released one of the most interesting and

399
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:57,839
important areas of transhumanism is the

400
00:15:53,340 --> 00:16:01,430
idea that people want to enhance their

401
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:04,410
abilities beyond what my colleague

402
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:09,120
Fabrizio Duran talked about species

403
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:12,209
specific capabilities so if I correct my

404
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,550
eye to correct my vision with contact

405
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:17,010
lenses but that doesn't make me see

406
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:21,750
better or farther more clearly or

407
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:24,780
different wavelengths than then which is

408
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:28,230
species specific on the other hand if I

409
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:30,689
can see you know through walls or I can

410
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:33,770
see farther away with more precision

411
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:37,470
than then we're getting beyond species

412
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:39,750
specific limitations so so that's the

413
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:44,700
that's sort of a positive value is the

414
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:47,520
idea that is very old that human beings

415
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:52,620
want to be able to do things that their

416
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:56,579
bodies and minds can't can't do this

417
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:59,220
goes back to putting on furs for a

418
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:01,800
Neanderthals in order to protect

419
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:06,000
themselves because being naked Apes was

420
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:09,209
not suitable for living in Norway it's

421
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,390
and so as a very crude exam is a very

422
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:13,500
crude example the other angle about this

423
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:16,860
I think there's something pretty

424
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:19,459
fundamental about human nature that even

425
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:22,770
today can be measured my colleague

426
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:25,560
Robert Cloninger is a psychiatric

427
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:30,500
geneticist he's done extensive work on

428
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:35,490
what are genetically relatively specific

429
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:37,050
capabilities that people embody and as

430
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:41,090
you might imagine there's enormous

431
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:41,090
variation one of the most powerful

432
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:50,160
personality characteristics is novelty

433
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:52,379
seeking and people very enormous ly on a

434
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,630
whole spectrum in terms of how

435
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,790
comfortable they are with novelty

436
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:59,940
seeking in the flip side of that or the

437
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:02,790
opposite end of the direction is risk

438
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:05,400
aversion and people very pretty much

439
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,350
continuously on those two dimensions I

440
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,260
would imagine I would speculate that

441
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:12,379
many of the individuals here are high in

442
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:16,050
novelty seeking I haven't tested them

443
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:18,890
but that would be my informed guess and

444
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:22,320
so again I see I see this impulse to

445
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:24,540
body hacking as embodying something is

446
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,070
pretty fundamental to all of us

447
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:29,070
absolutely yeah I think so

448
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:32,189
further to a I think Victoria's point

449
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:35,370
about cognitive enhancers what I like to

450
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:37,260
discuss next is in a way what's

451
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,939
happening let's say at the university

452
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,590
level amongst these students but even

453
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,940
thinking ahead to things like genetic

454
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,970
modifications potentially of our

455
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:47,130
offspring so-called designer babies and

456
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,360
anything else in which we do have I

457
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,460
would say a kind of competitive

458
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,770
advantage against those individuals in

459
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,750
our society who don't have those or

460
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,520
whose parents or or those individuals

461
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,130
who just choose not to opt into that are

462
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:02,520
we at risk of creating arms races

463
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:04,080
amongst each other and in a way removing

464
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,620
the freedom that some people think that

465
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,810
they have for for not wanting to use

466
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,370
these these technologies are these

467
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:14,940
particular improvements and in a way

468
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:17,129
coercing both parents and individuals to

469
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,920
actually finally have to adopt these

470
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,600
these these enhancements just so that

471
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,429
they can compete with what would be

472
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:28,379
regular mainstream society and is that a

473
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:31,140
problem as if that's that's a big

474
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,580
question um I think I when I'm thinking

475
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,530
while you're talking about this one of

476
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,860
the first places that you typically see

477
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:40,230
this kind of tag any kind of technology

478
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:43,320
bubble up with a lot of effort is in the

479
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:45,000
military area so maybe even before

480
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,649
parents start using it you're going to

481
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,170
see this coming up in the military area

482
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:52,290
and I don't mean just the US military I

483
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:54,150
mean worldwide military and I say this

484
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,850
because I've been in some meetings again

485
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:59,210
I've had to not disclose what I heard in

486
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:01,439
the meeting but there are countries I

487
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:05,010
don't think this will be a surprise to

488
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,890
anyone in the room that do not have the

489
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:10,440
same kind of ethics that we do and they

490
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,430
feel like whatever you can do is fair

491
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,500
game so

492
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:16,020
they are already experimenting with

493
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,570
genetic enhancement human genetic

494
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,520
enhancement so I think to answer your

495
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:23,610
question we have parental selection I

496
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:26,070
think just judging from the evolution of

497
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:29,459
technology and emerging technologies

498
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:32,399
we'll see some of this maybe emerge in a

499
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:36,420
defense or military type environment

500
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,970
before maybe we try it out but I think

501
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,890
that certainly on the horizon that's

502
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,180
just my feeling you may see you may feel

503
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:45,810
like it's going to come up through the

504
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:47,700
private sector first but if emerging

505
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:52,590
technologies follow in the typical

506
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:56,160
pattern it will be a if it's values in a

507
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:59,580
military sense which it is then you

508
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:03,210
might see that start to start to see

509
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:06,800
signs of that and in the military we're

510
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:09,120
already using exoskeletons for uniforms

511
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,470
as an enhancement not genetic

512
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,139
enhancement but that's that's another

513
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,910
line but an exoskeleton that allows you

514
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,440
to carry more way to walk further if

515
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:19,800
you're in military you know how value

516
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:23,430
that could be so that's already that's

517
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:25,200
today so you can imagine that this is

518
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:27,810
already something that that's bubbling

519
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,190
up I think out there sure did you want

520
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,720
to comment on so a few years ago

521
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,190
actually read about a case where these

522
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,660
parents wanted their child to be deaf

523
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,160
because they were deaf and so they were

524
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,570
looking into whether or not the doctor

525
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,310
could make the child deaf and if they

526
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,270
the doctor wasn't willing to do it they

527
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,740
said that they would take their own

528
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,420
means to do it because they wanted their

529
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,820
child to be included in the deaf

530
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,350
community because it's more than just

531
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:48,210
just it's not a disability to them it's

532
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,379
an entire community in a way of life so

533
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,720
I think that's also something to be

534
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,580
considered because a lot of people won't

535
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,530
consider that a modification that's for

536
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,810
the good of the child and it's kind of

537
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,430
reaching upon their autonomy so I think

538
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:01,260
that's do you have an opinion on it one

539
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:03,450
way or the other I think it's really

540
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,890
preaching upon their autonomy personally

541
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,870
because it's a child who would otherwise

542
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,430
be able to hear and so I think it's kind

543
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,139
of a disadvantage to put them into the

544
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,760
world when the parents know like they

545
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,700
have their own struggles to overcome as

546
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,430
deaf individuals so yeah that's a very

547
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,630
challenging example right uh Patricia I

548
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,950
struggle with that let me say it would

549
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,070
be appropriate for me to follow

550
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,930
yeah please so so one of the things I

551
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,000
would encourage our audience and

552
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:30,330
people who are interested in this stuff

553
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,800
is you know a careful reading of history

554
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:38,750
can really be revealing and so back in

555
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:44,430
oh gosh probably 40 or 50 40 years ago

556
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:47,670
John money was a psychologist at Johns

557
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:51,870
Hopkins who ultimately developed

558
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:54,480
policies around how infants was sexually

559
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:58,439
ambiguous genitalia should be treated

560
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:02,040
and the the long and short of it was is

561
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,530
is that at that point in time he

562
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,639
recommended that pediatricians enter

563
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:12,500
chronologiste psychiatrists surgeons

564
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:16,230
would we should assign a gender identity

565
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:19,500
to children with ambiguous genitalia

566
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:21,270
based on the phenotypic resemblance of

567
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,550
their genitalia to either male and

568
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:27,900
female and so put them into a specific

569
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:29,870
gender binary that policy ruled the

570
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,910
roost all there was virtually zero

571
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:35,040
evidence scientific evidence that

572
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:38,760
suggested if that was the right thing to

573
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:41,490
do some people call these sorts of

574
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:45,270
individuals today or or self-identify as

575
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:49,140
intersex individuals and 30 years later

576
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:54,330
they're evolved a movement of people who

577
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:56,220
wish to not only not have their gender

578
00:23:54,330 --> 00:24:00,659
assigned to them by somebody else at

579
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:03,450
maturity but rather for them to to

580
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:07,890
undergo their choice to either be male

581
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:10,530
female or intersex at the at the point

582
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:12,120
of their adolescence at some point in

583
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:15,330
their adolescence when they were able to

584
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:18,179
really consider fully the pros and cons

585
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:20,970
in an arena and so that that was

586
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:25,680
standard medical practice for 25 years

587
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:28,470
which over the past 10 or so years has

588
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:31,830
now been called into question now there

589
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:35,070
again these are complex issues as sherry

590
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:37,379
sort of suggested because there are

591
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:40,070
certain risks that

592
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:45,510
for example undertake undertaking

593
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:49,549
general surgery as a teenager that are

594
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:52,679
higher than then as an infant in

595
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:57,240
correspondingly there's depending on the

596
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:58,940
cause of the intersex condition there

597
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,789
are risks for particular diseases

598
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:05,160
including cancer that should be

599
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:08,760
addressed earlier rather than later and

600
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:12,270
so this whole idea of you know how to

601
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,700
handle handle intersex individuals is

602
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:17,789
very much under discussion I think in

603
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:20,570
some ways again a powerful argument for

604
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:23,390
why these deliberations about body

605
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:26,370
modification either biological or

606
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:29,750
electromechanical are worth conducting

607
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:33,418
so we don't repeat mistakes of the past

608
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:35,460
um yeah am I just going to really we've

609
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:36,900
just a little bit unless it sounds like

610
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,700
it something wanted to say so yeah just

611
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,390
I want to jump in on answering the

612
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:44,669
question of course genetics arms race is

613
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:46,830
inevitable but I want to reel it back

614
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:48,090
and make an argument that genetic

615
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:51,210
modification is the moral and ethical

616
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:52,799
thing to do you know as human beings

617
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,690
we've been slowly opting out of the

618
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,789
selective process and through the

619
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:59,220
miracles of medicine babies born with a

620
00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:01,260
heart defect we perform surgery remove

621
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,510
the defect but we're not addressing the

622
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,530
root cause which is a genetic

623
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:08,220
abnormality which causes this and it's

624
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:09,720
it's my belief that it truly is the

625
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,990
moral and ethical thing to do to be able

626
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:15,150
to modify the genes of that baby to to

627
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:16,470
fix that issue of course with the

628
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,000
technology you're going to get people

629
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,890
that want to preemptively design their

630
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,049
babies and do all this this is fallout

631
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:25,100
this is human nature it's going to

632
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:27,120
happen but these the positives are that

633
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,209
overwhelmingly you know human beings be

634
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:33,239
able to guide their own evolution and

635
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:35,909
and resolve these kind of lethal genetic

636
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,830
defects so you it's always two sides of

637
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:40,409
the same coin but when we're talking

638
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:42,449
about things like making a child deaf I

639
00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:44,429
think it's pretty obvious that the line

640
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,840
is if you remove a capability that's

641
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:48,570
going against the advancement of

642
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,399
humanity it's pretty simple in my mind

643
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,350
that if you're going to enhance

644
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,480
capabilities

645
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:55,370
like people ask what I chop off my arm

646
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,530
to get a prosthetic only if the

647
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:00,590
prosthetic is better in every way right

648
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:02,270
if I can feel the breeze on my arm you

649
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:06,409
know that's that's as value and that's

650
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:08,299
so that's important so you know the the

651
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:09,679
line I think is going to be there's

652
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:12,049
going to be a section of humanity that's

653
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,540
going to pervert it and use it for their

654
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:17,480
own purposes I mean there was a several

655
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:19,700
cases of young boys being born with the

656
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,710
genetic modification well not a

657
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,049
modification with a mutation where

658
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:25,309
they're exceptionally strong at one-year

659
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:27,530
old they're running around doing one-arm

660
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:29,590
push-ups and immediately those parents

661
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:32,149
were getting calls from like NFL coaches

662
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:34,428
so there is going to be this bizarre

663
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:38,150
sect of humanity that's going to try to

664
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:39,500
create the perfect baby right and it

665
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:41,510
reminds me that dr. Seuss book where

666
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,370
everybody has scars and then they all go

667
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:45,200
to have them removed because and there

668
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,899
there will be that so and I don't think

669
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,870
there's any way to not have that happen

670
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,960
but I think it's the ethical thing to to

671
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:55,280
advance human society to the point where

672
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,010
you know people can actually resolve

673
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,809
these medical defects and and even

674
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,940
change our species for space travel when

675
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:03,049
moving on so it's interesting

676
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,030
what you're saying when you talk about

677
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:06,799
resolving genetic defects that's one

678
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:08,809
thing that's therapeutic but what we're

679
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,000
talking about through enhancement or

680
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:13,340
through the transhumanist ethos however

681
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,929
is going beyond what's called therapy

682
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,129
and exactly that moving into the realm

683
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:19,190
of enhancement hence amongst

684
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:22,520
bioethicists you do have this this this

685
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:24,230
constant debate about is it enhancement

686
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,179
or at therapy and you do have some

687
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:28,490
episodes who argue that that's actually

688
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:31,460
a very blurry thing that it all depends

689
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:33,830
on you know the frame and the context

690
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:36,490
within which you look at that particular

691
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:38,830
modification let me give you an example

692
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:42,230
as we know CRISPR is revolutionizing

693
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:44,899
genetics as we know it and research in

694
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:46,730
China is pretty much at the vanguard

695
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,990
when it comes to doing work on human

696
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,360
embryos in fact the only ones who have

697
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:52,640
actually really done it the first one

698
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,290
was interesting in as much as they

699
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,780
actually were the first to actually used

700
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:59,840
CRISPR on a on a on an embryo human

701
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:02,480
embryo what they did was they managed to

702
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,919
resolve a very serious blood genetic

703
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,600
blood disorder

704
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,000
but for me the second experiment was

705
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,439
much more profound what they did was

706
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,510
because as we know CRISPR is not just

707
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,110
knocking out a gene crispers also adding

708
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:16,730
a gene and what they added was a very

709
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,770
rare mutation amongst humans

710
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:21,500
exceptionally rare mutation that gives

711
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:23,900
one in a natural immunity toward the HIV

712
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:27,380
virus so imagine that you actually born

713
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:29,360
with an immunity to HIV so what the

714
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:31,550
Chinese scientists did is a proof of a

715
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,090
proof of concept was they actually

716
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:37,970
isolated that that particular genetic

717
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:40,010
sequence and they plugged it into their

718
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,910
little embryo and see if it would stick

719
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:45,580
wasn't it wasn't the most successful

720
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:49,490
experiment but they did manage to

721
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:50,720
largely succeed in that and what struck

722
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:52,790
me the most about that particular

723
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,470
experiment was that this was the very

724
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:57,470
first example in human history of a

725
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:59,060
transhumanist or trans human actual

726
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:00,500
modification of the number that was the

727
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,760
number was destroyed afterwards by the

728
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,770
way in all cases the embers are just

729
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,580
destroyed because what you actually have

730
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:10,100
now is arguably a potential individual

731
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:11,419
who would have a super immune system

732
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,010
that they would not normally have been

733
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:15,590
endowed with unless they happen to that

734
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:17,720
lucky 0.0001 percent of human population

735
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,800
now let's just extrapolate this across

736
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,360
the entire humanity and let's assume

737
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,830
that for one moment that we decide that

738
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,320
make this a conventional thing and that

739
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:27,080
everybody has everybody is naturally

740
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,300
genetically immune to HIV would we

741
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:32,240
consider that would we still call that

742
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:34,340
an enhancement or will we just call it

743
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,970
now a part of normal human functioning

744
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:40,490
much in the same way the anti-vaxxers

745
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:42,350
aside much in the same way that we

746
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:44,300
consider vaccinations today to be part

747
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:45,409
of normal human functioning each of any

748
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,510
each and every one of you who've been

749
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,980
vaccinated are super immune in a way

750
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,930
that you'd normally wouldn't be you

751
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,820
would normally be susceptible to all

752
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:54,830
sorts of atrocious diseases out there

753
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:58,370
but you've got super immune systems

754
00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:01,340
you're all enhanced so with that long I

755
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:03,139
guess a comment I wouldn't mind if we

756
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,760
delved into that debate a little bit

757
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,970
about therapy versus enhancement and

758
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:11,180
it'll start off with Victoria yeah I

759
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:13,430
think that the sharing thing mentioned

760
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:16,220
early on what is medically necessary as

761
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:17,360
a norm and I think that this entire body

762
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,640
acting area just

763
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,459
challenges at norm you know what is

764
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:27,440
medically necessary it has got to have a

765
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:30,920
whole new meaning or or just be narrowed

766
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,809
into a different line of cases but I

767
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,429
think that's where we start from it's

768
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:37,450
challenging that norm of medically

769
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:41,120
necessary so that just opens up a lot

770
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:42,350
everything else I think if it's

771
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,820
medically if it's not pneumatically

772
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:46,760
necessary then I think there should be

773
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:48,950
strict regulations about it so cognitive

774
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,870
and enhancement drugs are not medically

775
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:52,700
necessary but it definitely improves the

776
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:54,500
quality of life for a lot of people and

777
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,299
they're studying habits and just like

778
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,799
staying awake to do your job that you're

779
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:00,260
supposed to do so I know a lot of

780
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:02,270
professionals use it but I think that it

781
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:04,490
has a lot of side effects that we're not

782
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:06,799
sure of down the line and then also just

783
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:08,299
kind of hard issues and for students

784
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,950
that's my concern because a lot of

785
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:12,350
students get it not from a doctor but

786
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:13,429
from friends or from the dealer so my

787
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,659
concern with that is that they're

788
00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:16,280
hurting their bodies more than they're

789
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,660
going to get enhancements from it

790
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,770
so down the road they might have a heart

791
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,020
attack because they're weakening their

792
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,940
heart from taking a drug that kind of

793
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,580
speeds up their body in their heart so I

794
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:28,340
think there should be more regulating

795
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:30,110
about that on campuses so for you when

796
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:32,209
it comes to exceeding human capacity

797
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:34,280
that's when your flags are raised yeah I

798
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:35,990
think it's okay to exceed human capacity

799
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,668
as we think of it but I think it needs

800
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:40,190
to be done safely that's my name Drew's

801
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:43,970
earn something something so I mean I

802
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:47,470
agree what's been said so far in light

803
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:51,710
of the prior the keynote lecture from

804
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:57,080
dr. Rowe I I think we all have to

805
00:32:51,710 --> 00:33:00,620
understand that there's a in

806
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,870
infrastructure in medicine addressing

807
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:07,489
therapies including ones I mean your

808
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:10,729
example of immunity and immunizations a

809
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:15,020
great a great example of what crosses

810
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:16,809
over it's I think it's debatable whether

811
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:20,360
it goes beyond species specific

812
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:21,889
capabilities because well for another

813
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,070
discussion but

814
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:29,090
the infrastructure for developing

815
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:32,059
medical therapies you know has intense

816
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:40,279
regulations and not the least of which

817
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:42,769
is to prevent either ineffective or

818
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:47,299
dangerous technologies from being

819
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:50,179
perpetuated on the public you know that

820
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:53,990
again going back to history the the

821
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:59,289
story of of enhancements and therapies

822
00:33:53,990 --> 00:34:03,799
is it goes but one moment was in the oh

823
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:06,110
what 19th century late 19th century you

824
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:09,290
probably heard about it seen on westerns

825
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:14,449
about patent medicine people who would

826
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:17,929
sell various products promising various

827
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:20,388
sorts of benefits panaceas concoctions

828
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:22,790
election elixirs and so forth some of

829
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:25,820
which were simply ineffective some of

830
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:28,609
which were toxic and the the fact that

831
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:33,169
people were exploited for business

832
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:36,020
selfish interests led the u.s. to pass

833
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:38,810
among other things the Pure Food Drug

834
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:41,060
and even cosmetics Act which is an

835
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:43,489
interesting implication to the

836
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,710
enhancement connection that is the

837
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:48,859
cosmetics were deemed because of their

838
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:52,030
potential harm to skin were deemed to

839
00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:56,750
warrant regulation as well and so so

840
00:34:52,030 --> 00:35:00,380
that began a transition of developing

841
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:02,030
tech afford for developing technologies

842
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:04,820
to be sure that they were safe and

843
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:07,099
effective culminating in the FDA and so

844
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:09,920
forth that we have today regardless of

845
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:12,890
what you think of about the efficacy of

846
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,109
the FDA or governmental regulation I

847
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:18,080
think you also have to think of what

848
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:20,930
mister dr. o thought about and has

849
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:24,080
discussed with us which is that people

850
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:26,799
who are selling these bio enhancement or

851
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:30,319
electromechanical enhancements have

852
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,450
prevailing motive to make money and they

853
00:35:30,319 --> 00:35:35,670
may not have a particular interest in

854
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:40,490
your welfare and so we shouldn't be nice

855
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:44,910
even in moving forward with either

856
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:48,629
therapies or enhancements um I'm all um

857
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:50,040
you've obviously um does we've talked

858
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:52,349
about you've you've gone through with

859
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,359
some modifications um I would like to

860
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:57,569
kind of turn out towards potential risks

861
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:58,950
sure um and I mean I can come up I can

862
00:35:57,569 --> 00:36:00,329
conjure you know lots of different

863
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,470
scenarios I wouldn't mind hearing what

864
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:02,849
kind of scares you a little bit about

865
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,859
what you've done it yourself potentially

866
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:07,859
and maybe larger you know trends that

867
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:10,710
might come from it we might hear some of

868
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:12,270
your thoughts on that minute sure so you

869
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,920
know these modifications are purely

870
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,049
enhancement there there's no disease

871
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,609
that they're protecting against the you

872
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:20,579
know vaccines are like pre-emptive

873
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:23,040
therapy but they're they're pure

874
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:26,250
enhancement so my body is now capable of

875
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,540
performing cryptography for example and

876
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:30,960
there's a fundamental psychological

877
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:33,420
impact too to have any devices and you

878
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,000
know we make them so that they're

879
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,680
transparent as possible they disappear

880
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,910
like we're all sitting here and our

881
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,470
kidneys are working hard but we don't

882
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:42,660
think about it and they're doing a good

883
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:44,759
job so you know we try to make

884
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:48,270
technologies like that that just become

885
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,430
so ingrained in your daily life but with

886
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:52,290
no management so you don't have to

887
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:53,819
manage your keys your wallet your phone

888
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:55,770
you know I've gotten rid of my keys so

889
00:36:53,819 --> 00:36:58,950
I've gotten rid of one-third of that

890
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:59,970
management burden but part of the thing

891
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,950
that that worries me

892
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:04,140
isn't necessarily the medical

893
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:06,509
implications I mean we have decades of

894
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,920
worth of data for the materials I mean

895
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:10,680
pets that can get me implants similar to

896
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,500
this for a long time so I'm not worried

897
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,240
about that kind of thing what I am

898
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,099
worried about is things like mr. doctor

899
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,259
was talking about you know we're using

900
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:21,569
ships from NXP and they have some code

901
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:23,700
that's closed are their back doors

902
00:37:21,569 --> 00:37:25,349
there's other people making similar

903
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,819
things now in the biohacking space but

904
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:28,740
they're using like Chinese ships that

905
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:29,880
have back doors and they advertise they

906
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,558
have back doors but they might not

907
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,990
advertise other back doors that they'll

908
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:36,059
have so there's this kind of sense that

909
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,529
now I have a part of me something in my

910
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:39,660
body that I consider to be part of me

911
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:41,790
very much so part of my identity but

912
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:44,040
there's a there's a company involved

913
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:46,529
that's not mine and software involved

914
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,549
this online now we're even moving into

915
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,529
new new territory where we have the

916
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:54,009
some flexible transponders they're made

917
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:57,130
of biopolymers the material is you know

918
00:37:54,009 --> 00:37:59,739
iso and USP grade six and all this but

919
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:01,539
in our process and all of this we we

920
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:03,099
employ beta testers to you know because

921
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:05,709
we don't know if the way that we've

922
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:09,189
constructed the device is is altering

923
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:12,339
the performance that material so we we

924
00:38:09,189 --> 00:38:14,678
have a robust beta testing you know

925
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:17,049
group but this is all outside of you

926
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:19,900
know ir bees and any kind of review

927
00:38:17,049 --> 00:38:21,969
boards and I mean the company's name is

928
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,619
dangerous things we put it right out

929
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:26,949
there like eight this is this is a

930
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:29,829
potentially dangerous so you know

931
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:31,630
creating new products testing them out I

932
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:33,609
always I have five prototypes now so I

933
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:36,009
applied five devices two prototypes and

934
00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:38,229
some other ones and I test them first I

935
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:40,179
you know have them removed and looked at

936
00:38:38,229 --> 00:38:43,419
and all these things but the scary thing

937
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:45,819
is that I think that as it grows as an

938
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:49,329
industry and the drive to make money is

939
00:38:45,819 --> 00:38:52,390
there that subverts the community aspect

940
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:53,589
of what's going on and somebody will get

941
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:56,368
hurt you know

942
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:58,449
and apart from what scares me about

943
00:38:56,369 --> 00:39:00,130
about the impact to the biohacking

944
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:02,609
community that that's that's very

945
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:05,709
relevant but I think the impact to

946
00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:07,449
transhumanism and society in general I

947
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:10,660
mean by acting as part of that

948
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:12,640
transhumanist endeavor right and what

949
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,410
we're doing on bionics you know

950
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,719
enhancing biology through direct

951
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:19,629
implantation that can be curtailed

952
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:21,599
heavily if there is such an accident or

953
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:23,410
somebody has an adverse reaction or

954
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,209
inflation goes wrong and they get an

955
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:26,890
infection and die I mean these are all

956
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:29,799
possibilities that's that's the kind of

957
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:31,179
stuff right that scares me not just from

958
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:33,519
the things that we sell but just in

959
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:37,479
general from the community at large

960
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:39,399
Victoria um your resume shows you've

961
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:42,939
done work with such very scary topics

962
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:44,619
bioterrorism and all that stuff you you

963
00:39:42,939 --> 00:39:46,420
must go to some very dark places in

964
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:48,369
terms of you know some scenarios but

965
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:51,089
what could you say in terms of the risk

966
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:55,089
as it pertains to body hacking

967
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:57,729
specifically yes my my biggest concern

968
00:39:55,089 --> 00:40:00,849
is thinking about 150 years into the

969
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:01,870
future and I have his scenario that I've

970
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:04,030
been working on

971
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:05,680
that I'm trying to think through so I'm

972
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:09,730
going to throw it out here for the first

973
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:12,940
time I have this concern that if we do

974
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:16,600
start doing human genetic modification

975
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:18,850
that this is going to become important

976
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,970
for industry of course and that's going

977
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:24,880
to require gearing up for coming up with

978
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:27,520
the best genetic modification the

979
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,380
company B has and selling your genetic

980
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,390
modification getting intellectual

981
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:37,170
property on it which we've already seen

982
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:40,750
can be done on on specific gene snips so

983
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:43,330
my biggest concern is that this is going

984
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:46,450
to eventually weakened it to human

985
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:49,150
subject testing and you're going to have

986
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:51,220
not only killing the the embryo after

987
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:55,120
you see if it actually works

988
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:58,209
I like your example with inserting the

989
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:00,940
via CRISPR gene but what if you need to

990
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:03,160
see how it actually expresses itself

991
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:06,340
which you ultimately will have to do

992
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:09,790
with a gene then are you are we going to

993
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:11,710
eventually as a society accept human

994
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:13,690
subjects experimentation for gene

995
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,740
therapy now you might say right now oh

996
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:17,050
no way

997
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:19,930
but let me give you this scenario what

998
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:24,310
if what if this extreme what if our

999
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:29,310
climate became so so difficult for us to

1000
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:32,259
adapt to rapidly enough because of

1001
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:34,330
obvious climatic changes however you

1002
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:36,840
want to characterize it we have changed

1003
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:38,529
going on let's just say scenario we got

1004
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,000
dramatically worse fate a lot of

1005
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:43,030
volcanoes something happened to make our

1006
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,430
atmosphere dramatically worse what if we

1007
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:47,080
had to rapidly change the human

1008
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:49,240
condition to be able to survive on earth

1009
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:52,930
and this isn't really that far out for

1010
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:55,029
some future thinkers then the pressure

1011
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,890
might be on to use human subject testing

1012
00:41:55,030 --> 00:42:00,640
okay if it means that survival the

1013
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:02,650
species okay then maybe we we can accept

1014
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,350
human subjects house same with genetics

1015
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:07,740
and then you have to think about okay

1016
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:12,490
we're going to have a generation of

1017
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:15,310
people who are these in another class

1018
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:15,700
they're human they were human genetic

1019
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:18,250
tests

1020
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:20,348
sentence is sounding weird but stay with

1021
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:22,210
me here I'm talking 150 years and we've

1022
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:25,240
got pressures that we don't think

1023
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:29,290
possible at this point what if we then

1024
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:32,229
create that a new whole underclass of

1025
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:36,849
humans that were human testing subjects

1026
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:41,050
how how do we even think about about

1027
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:44,560
dealing with that and so I'll throw that

1028
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:47,050
horrific thought out there for you but

1029
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,869
you can see how we cuz we could go down

1030
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:53,290
that path and perhaps find ourselves

1031
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:55,510
thinking about that horrific kind of

1032
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:57,220
decision-making and let's say you know

1033
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:58,839
we haven't gone to another planet yet to

1034
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:02,129
set up colony and we have to cope with

1035
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:04,839
it here so that's very futuristic but

1036
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:07,510
something that we maybe should be

1037
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:10,980
thinking about sherry what keeps you up

1038
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:17,950
at night what keeps me up at night oh

1039
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:21,400
come on oh sure oh I don't know I like

1040
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:24,819
sleeping no sorry I like my sleep so I

1041
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:27,040
have a pretty easy goal think about I

1042
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:29,230
think she's just too much at night but I

1043
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,880
don't know it just kind of bothers me to

1044
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:32,710
think about like one decision I would

1045
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,450
make to enhance my body could breach on

1046
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:36,040
somebody else's I think that's kind of

1047
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:38,109
like I recently wrote an article about

1048
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,520
the contact lenses are embedded with

1049
00:43:38,109 --> 00:43:41,859
cameras so I just think there's a lot of

1050
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,210
legal issues with adopting technologies

1051
00:43:41,859 --> 00:43:44,859
like that where like I could take a

1052
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:47,349
picture of somebody in an intimate

1053
00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:48,819
setting and maybe put that online or

1054
00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:50,530
what happens to that when I die where is

1055
00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:52,630
that's the word who gets that when I die

1056
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:55,540
so things like that kind of just funky a

1057
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,500
little bit and just as a preview to some

1058
00:43:55,540 --> 00:44:00,000
things that have been said today

1059
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:03,069
tomorrow we are doing a panel on

1060
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,450
regulations certifications licensing of

1061
00:44:03,069 --> 00:44:05,470
these sorts of technologies and we will

1062
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:08,799
definitely get into some of these issues

1063
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:10,419
like privacy and surveillance and all

1064
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,280
that sort of stuff which are also a part

1065
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,869
of the ethical conversation as well John

1066
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,339
just want to add anything to kind of the

1067
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:19,589
risks and kind of things that you're

1068
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:24,040
particularly concerned about well so

1069
00:44:19,589 --> 00:44:26,950
from the idea of a bio enhancements of

1070
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:29,140
various sorts as well as again I call em

1071
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:34,960
electromechanical in

1072
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:37,060
I have two concerns one is has already

1073
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,180
been I think professor Martens already

1074
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:42,970
mentioned this about the idea of

1075
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:46,950
bringing these forward in an environment

1076
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:49,868
of pretty significant social injustice

1077
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:51,640
where the haves and the have-nots the

1078
00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:55,089
gap between the haves and the have-nots

1079
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:59,160
continues to widen and the availability

1080
00:44:55,089 --> 00:45:04,240
of these almost certainly very expensive

1081
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:07,540
enhancements to the haves are only going

1082
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:10,720
to continue to widen that gap and there

1083
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:14,550
seems to be increasingly very little

1084
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:17,618
consciousness in terms of addressing

1085
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:21,099
addressing these widening gaps in a very

1086
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:23,230
broad social level not just in that in

1087
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:24,910
the enhancement community then the

1088
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:27,940
second the second thing that I worry

1089
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:30,910
about that I think Victoria was sort of

1090
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:39,930
a looot perhaps alluding to is I worry

1091
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:43,390
about rogue practitioners so for example

1092
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:45,759
that will then create problems or

1093
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:49,450
challenges to us that were ill-prepared

1094
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:52,270
to deal with a good example as you know

1095
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:57,220
years ago when the first sheep was

1096
00:45:52,270 --> 00:46:01,990
cloned and there was a decision in many

1097
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:04,750
countries to ban human cloning I think

1098
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:06,790
it's only a matter of time before one or

1099
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:10,960
more rogue scientists start cloning

1100
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:16,750
humans and then we have a situation

1101
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:18,220
about how do we regard these people you

1102
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:22,540
know what status would they have in

1103
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:26,759
society they they would be denied at

1104
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:31,390
least on the on the face of it the

1105
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:38,020
ordinary expectations of citizenship and

1106
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:42,509
participation potentially and and and

1107
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:46,740
indeed might be well developed to serve

1108
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:46,740
how shall I put it more dark

1109
00:46:46,829 --> 00:46:50,710
applications I mean we already have

1110
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,150
problems with human trafficking we

1111
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:56,069
already have the problems with in

1112
00:46:52,150 --> 00:47:00,550
illegal organ procurement in

1113
00:46:56,069 --> 00:47:02,880
transportation you'll have enough of a

1114
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:06,880
science-fiction consciousness to know

1115
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:09,280
where where this could all go so those

1116
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,430
are the two areas then that I think

1117
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:16,780
about and I'm concerned about yes please

1118
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:18,160
so much to say okay so 150 years I think

1119
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,510
we'll definitely have the protein

1120
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,690
folding thing down and we'll be able to

1121
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:24,400
totally model all genetic modifications

1122
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:27,130
I'm not worried about that I'm worried

1123
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,480
about it in the next 10 years right we

1124
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:31,720
already have human test subjects for

1125
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,940
ourselves so it's happening now and so

1126
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,919
yeah I think it's a danger is more short

1127
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:39,040
short game long game I think I think

1128
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,470
we'll solve that issue and the thing I

1129
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,569
want to address is a the the idea I

1130
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:45,759
think of biohacking is to address the

1131
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:48,190
democratization of this technology and

1132
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,140
make it affordable accessible there's a

1133
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:52,660
lot of groups within biohacking that try

1134
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:55,240
to open-source their work you know we're

1135
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:57,609
doing work that to to build devices

1136
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,348
enhancements that are you know

1137
00:47:57,609 --> 00:48:01,060
affordable and something that you know

1138
00:47:59,349 --> 00:48:02,770
Apple and Samsung and Google aren't

1139
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:05,890
going to bring out for the next 50 years

1140
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:08,560
maybe who knows so if you look at the

1141
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:10,150
data of you know how quickly high

1142
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:13,299
technology is adopted that's actually

1143
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:15,250
shrinking the gap is income gap it's not

1144
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,720
technology gap you have people that are

1145
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:20,680
on food stamps but also have a cell

1146
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:23,470
phone so it's I see that you know the

1147
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:25,328
technology emerging affordable prices

1148
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:26,859
right out of the gate whereas you know

1149
00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:29,380
it took almost 100 years for everybody

1150
00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:31,450
get electricity and and once it was

1151
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:33,310
introduced and now it's ubiquitous I

1152
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,930
mean then the refrigerator took a little

1153
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:37,060
shorter time and the cellphones took

1154
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:39,250
only 10 years to gain ubiquity and

1155
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:40,990
you know anybody can go in a library and

1156
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:44,920
get on the internet so I think those

1157
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:47,379
those gaps are rapidly shrinking and you

1158
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,740
know we're talking about class warfare

1159
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:52,000
and things like that I mean we've seen

1160
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:53,529
uprisings because of these technologies

1161
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,260
and the availability and accessibility

1162
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:58,270
of them so the house would have not I

1163
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,890
think will come down to DRAM and control

1164
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:04,180
instead of availability and

1165
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:06,490
accessibility so I got I guess a

1166
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:10,899
conceptual question there is I would say

1167
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:12,700
kind of an emerging I guess counter a

1168
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:15,130
counter group to I guess the

1169
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,480
transhumanism and body hacking and for

1170
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:17,800
the lack of a better phrase they are I

1171
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,960
would refer to as the human

1172
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:23,140
Exceptionalist

1173
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:27,070
where you have thinkers who do draw the

1174
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:29,470
line very firmly and ascend thou shalt

1175
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:32,860
not pass kind of admonition where we are

1176
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:33,970
not to modify ourselves in these these

1177
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,530
sorts of ways such at the point where

1178
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:37,810
were you we risk now no longer being

1179
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:41,470
classified as human whatever that we

1180
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:43,540
might decide is and ahmal actually

1181
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:44,709
wouldn't start with you I mean what what

1182
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,900
would you say to the human

1183
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:50,020
Exceptionalist who worried that we will

1184
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:52,570
cease to become human at some point ask

1185
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:54,670
them if they order to filling I mean I

1186
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:56,920
mean comes down to that you you think

1187
00:49:54,670 --> 00:50:00,010
about you know enhancement or

1188
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:02,170
modification or anything you know is

1189
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:03,670
anybody ever you know have taken a drug

1190
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:05,950
to but I'm going to interrupt you there

1191
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:08,020
because it's qualitatively a tooth

1192
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:09,100
filling or shoes or a coat it's quite

1193
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,570
different than what we were talking

1194
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,980
about when we are talking about changes

1195
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:13,780
to actually let's say our cycle or

1196
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:15,130
psychological modalities sure we

1197
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:18,010
actually change the framework within

1198
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:20,770
which we look at others we look at

1199
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:22,570
ourselves our intellectual capacities

1200
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:24,460
have been augmented and our memorization

1201
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:25,720
skills are changed so that's not a tooth

1202
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:27,760
filling obviously and we are no longer

1203
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,410
now you know at a qualitative level what

1204
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,150
can be considered human and they worry

1205
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:33,970
that we not only risk alienating

1206
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:35,560
ourselves from the existing humanity but

1207
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:37,209
that this might lead to a slippery slope

1208
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:39,880
where we are now degrading and demeaning

1209
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:41,920
ourselves in ways that we would not

1210
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:44,320
doesn't fit in accordance with modern

1211
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,420
values sure I mean but all of that is

1212
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:49,630
subjective and it's always in flux right

1213
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:51,070
so even just our simple enhancements you

1214
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,960
know when I'm have my cell phone I'm a

1215
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:54,790
god I'm cognitive Dada and

1216
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,670
communications god I can touch any

1217
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:59,710
information in human history and that's

1218
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:01,900
you know that's not nothing and so

1219
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:04,320
simply moving this tool from here to in

1220
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:06,580
here there's not a real difference right

1221
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,770
we're already in this flock

1222
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:11,710
of changing social norms and all of this

1223
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:14,020
so I think that it's just um fear that's

1224
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:16,840
driving this kind of rebellion against

1225
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:18,790
it Victoria where your thoughts on human

1226
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,260
Exceptionalist yeah I think that's

1227
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:22,540
absolutely right I think you'll hear

1228
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:25,060
from every religious group about why

1229
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:26,680
this is not where society should be

1230
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:29,020
going where humans should not be going I

1231
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:32,230
think that's absolutely true and that's

1232
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:33,850
going to have to be something that you

1233
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:35,880
know we work through as a society I

1234
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:38,620
don't think there is an answer to that

1235
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:40,360
and you might say well why can't we all

1236
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:42,279
just get along why don't you live over

1237
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,990
here and you're human exceptional and we

1238
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:47,050
live over here in our transhumanists

1239
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:48,910
world but both is booked but both of

1240
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:51,910
those worlds want us all to be the same

1241
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:53,589
world so and you are almost inevitably

1242
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:55,629
you're going to be sitting in the same

1243
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:58,270
room with with everyone you're going to

1244
00:51:55,630 --> 00:52:00,970
be going the same functions in society

1245
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:03,610
with everyone so that I think that's

1246
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:05,950
where the problem is that to the extent

1247
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:08,470
that you can't live in your own group

1248
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:10,930
with those values they're going to clash

1249
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:14,020
and then we're going to have to come to

1250
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:15,819
some be accepting I think of both groups

1251
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:19,060
in some way but I don't know if that's

1252
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:24,340
going to be enough don't matter I know

1253
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:27,130
the answer noun genre sherry I agree

1254
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:29,680
with both of you actually I don't think

1255
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:32,230
this is anything this this problem is

1256
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:37,419
anything particular particularly unique

1257
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:43,960
to the transhumanist movement at all I

1258
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:46,960
really see this as as the problem that

1259
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:49,450
humans have faced for millennia which is

1260
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:52,410
how do we get along with each other

1261
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:56,710
how do we respect each other's values

1262
00:52:52,410 --> 00:53:01,720
how do we accept others who are

1263
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:04,090
different from us and I really think

1264
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:07,540
that has a lot to do with the you know

1265
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:10,060
sort of the political sphere rather than

1266
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:12,670
rather than any particular technological

1267
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:15,430
one John would you argue though that

1268
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:17,620
education and communication usually work

1269
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:19,279
to break down those barriers between

1270
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:23,080
tribes I mean

1271
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,460
wish you were director I really do

1272
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:28,430
now but now then you raise an

1273
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:30,590
interesting direction here because you

1274
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:34,009
know I am an educator I'm a professional

1275
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:39,080
educator I'm a professor I believe in

1276
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:41,390
education and there are new developments

1277
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,520
new technological developments that I

1278
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:45,109
think make those sorts of efforts much

1279
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,870
more difficult you know we're here you

1280
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:49,670
know when the current look on your

1281
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:53,359
Twitter feed and there's discussion

1282
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:55,430
about post truth and you know lies and

1283
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:57,980
what counts as lies and you get to

1284
00:53:55,430 --> 00:54:02,540
decide who's lying this is a real

1285
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:05,380
problem this is a new problem the other

1286
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:08,090
thing that's just that's that's

1287
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:10,790
disturbing about the the potency of

1288
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:16,190
educated education alone to make

1289
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:20,470
differences is is that you know the new

1290
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:23,510
the internet culture allows people to

1291
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:26,779
talk only to those people who mirror

1292
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:28,160
their own ideas and basically exclude

1293
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:32,470
others who don't

1294
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:35,149
mirror their ideas and that seems to me

1295
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:37,520
again this is my speculation that has a

1296
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:40,130
lot to do with the sort of radicalism

1297
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:42,620
that we're seeing a various strikes

1298
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:47,230
around around the world that then hear

1299
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:50,420
ups in these polarizing you know hate

1300
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:55,280
positions on a whole variety of issues

1301
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:58,850
and so in some ways I I see that this is

1302
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:02,030
a major challenge perhaps the major

1303
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:03,980
challenge for the future I would imagine

1304
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:08,050
though that if we're talking specularly

1305
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:10,900
far far future where you know

1306
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:13,580
communications more on a whim and

1307
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:15,500
emotional connection with people and

1308
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:17,870
cognitive connection with people we're

1309
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:19,760
talking singularity right where we have

1310
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:22,790
this kind of neural interface where we

1311
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:25,310
can communicate as a cognitive group you

1312
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:27,410
know being able to be educated not just

1313
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:29,509
from news of political human endeavor

1314
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:32,390
but like scientific fact and things that

1315
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:35,390
that could be tested empirically

1316
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:37,670
you know I do believe that we'll reach a

1317
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:40,129
point through technology where we can

1318
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:41,690
have this this understanding of each

1319
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:44,089
other even if we don't agree there's an

1320
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:46,069
understanding of intent and that

1321
00:55:44,089 --> 00:55:48,019
understanding of intent alone will help

1322
00:55:46,069 --> 00:55:51,859
defuse this kind of I hope your

1323
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:54,709
generation is able to reform education

1324
00:55:51,859 --> 00:55:56,299
so some of the fundamental skills that

1325
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:59,470
are so relevant today

1326
00:55:56,299 --> 00:56:05,119
in terms of being skeptical and critical

1327
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:08,480
will be regained in ways that I too much

1328
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:10,339
worry have been lost George I was

1329
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,349
thinking of an analogy to your question

1330
00:56:10,339 --> 00:56:13,038
about the transhumanist versus a human

1331
00:56:12,349 --> 00:56:14,569
Exceptionalist

1332
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:16,720
and one way to may it might have

1333
00:56:14,569 --> 00:56:19,489
instructive to think about and that is

1334
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:22,009
the two classes today if you think about

1335
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:25,309
this - the big clash I think in many

1336
00:56:22,009 --> 00:56:28,400
ways in it the emergence of technology

1337
00:56:25,309 --> 00:56:30,980
is the people who use their cell phone a

1338
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,749
lot versus the people are very critical

1339
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:34,759
but these people are always looking at

1340
00:56:32,749 --> 00:56:36,399
their cell phone you know I'm sure

1341
00:56:34,759 --> 00:56:39,079
you're aware of you've heard that right

1342
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:42,230
it's generational but it also crosses

1343
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:46,910
generations it's not just generational

1344
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:47,299
so who is it how do we how do we fix

1345
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:50,359
that

1346
00:56:47,299 --> 00:56:51,559
that that clash because that even

1347
00:56:50,359 --> 00:56:53,569
exceptional I think this is like the

1348
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:56,329
lost generation or the lost group of

1349
00:56:53,569 --> 00:56:57,680
people who never go beyond yet don't

1350
00:56:56,329 --> 00:57:00,380
connect with humans anymore because

1351
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:02,629
they're on their cell phone but well

1352
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:04,039
where we'll be a momentum V are we going

1353
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:05,569
to have more movements and coming from

1354
00:57:04,039 --> 00:57:07,789
the human exceptional aside or is the

1355
00:57:05,569 --> 00:57:10,788
momentum on the connecting with

1356
00:57:07,789 --> 00:57:12,619
technology side and I would suggest that

1357
00:57:10,789 --> 00:57:15,140
the momentum is really with the

1358
00:57:12,619 --> 00:57:18,650
technology side and is it changing us

1359
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:21,348
yes it is and then this the other group

1360
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:24,249
doesn't like what they see but if the

1361
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:27,680
momentum seems to be going this way so

1362
00:57:24,249 --> 00:57:30,078
how do we learn to cope with that that

1363
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,720
change and who we are and how we relate

1364
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:35,150
to each other because it is changing and

1365
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:39,680
I think that's where the momentum is yes

1366
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:43,249
you have that that to do these two very

1367
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:44,799
strongly opinionated divisions and how

1368
00:57:43,249 --> 00:57:47,410
we're coping with that

1369
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:50,080
one final question and then I'd like to

1370
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:53,109
have the the audience start to pitch

1371
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:55,360
their own questions and let's imagine

1372
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:56,650
that we're going to be gathering ten

1373
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:59,710
years hence it's going to be body hacks

1374
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:02,530
twenty twenty seven and I'll go as well

1375
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:05,680
the five of us will be here again um

1376
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:11,440
what will we be talking about it come on

1377
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:15,879
oh boy ten years hmm probably Mars

1378
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,300
colony I would hope that would be

1379
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,800
amazing

1380
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:19,510
that's a tight timeline but that would

1381
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:22,270
be amazing and probably the technologies

1382
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:24,810
that got us there both you know

1383
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:27,570
spacefaring but also human technologies

1384
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:30,820
genetics is going to be off the charts

1385
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:34,060
there's probably already going to be AI

1386
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:36,640
that's starting to creep into into human

1387
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:38,619
endeavor yeah it would be very

1388
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,118
interesting I think when you couple AI

1389
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:42,340
with talk the advancement then it's just

1390
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:45,310
like off-the-charts crazy but ten years

1391
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:46,960
of maybe a little too soon for that sure

1392
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:49,330
I think kind of backtracking to the

1393
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,830
cognitive enhancement drugs I'm hoping

1394
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:52,359
we don't have drugs that can keep us

1395
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:53,799
awake for 30 days or more without

1396
00:58:52,359 --> 00:58:56,700
needing sleep because I think that's

1397
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:58,630
like things like sleep and rest and like

1398
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:00,640
things of that sort are kind of

1399
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:02,560
fundamental to us being human so kind of

1400
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,000
backtracking also to being human and

1401
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,980
what makes us human I think I would be

1402
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,390
kind of a sad existence if our whole

1403
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,530
life just becomes like I'm going to take

1404
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:09,640
this because I have to go to work and

1405
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:11,080
the whole life's just gonna be work work

1406
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:13,509
work and being productive all the time I

1407
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,410
think that's a sad existence so I really

1408
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:17,530
hope that doesn't happen

1409
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:21,700
did you shy from sleep deprivation did

1410
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:23,950
you guys first you guys have mentioned

1411
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:25,480
all right there cancer Korean gamers do

1412
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:26,379
it all the time yeah but DARPA is

1413
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,790
definitely trying to create the

1414
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:29,890
so-called Super Soldier and they're

1415
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:31,660
trying to figure out how to create the

1416
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:33,460
soldier that either needs minimal amount

1417
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:35,290
of sleep or no sleep at all the first

1418
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:39,670
transhumans will be u.s. soldiers it's

1419
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:45,160
my institution there were studies funded

1420
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:47,710
by DARPA for knockout mice that don't

1421
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,899
need sleep and they're interested in in

1422
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:52,630
their behavior has anybody done

1423
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:54,180
polyphasic sleep it doesn't work that's

1424
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:56,470
great

1425
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:57,580
if you have you want to fill in the

1426
00:59:56,470 --> 01:00:00,430
audience what that is

1427
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:01,600
sure so polyphasic sleep is essentially

1428
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,710
where you're awake

1429
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,150
approximately three and a half hours

1430
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:07,270
they take a 20-minute nap and you're but

1431
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:09,460
awakened and getting into a tough

1432
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:11,230
getting out of it is even tougher for

1433
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:12,160
different reasons but essentially the

1434
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:14,040
idea is you can cut down your sleep

1435
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:16,029
requirement and still function at a

1436
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:17,590
decent level and I think there was a

1437
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:19,750
study done where it showed about a seven

1438
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:22,780
percent degradation performance but you

1439
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:24,490
gain the ability to essentially work

1440
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:25,930
much much more nerds where people do it

1441
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:28,089
but yeah so go sailing around the world

1442
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:30,609
and stuff like the rain I did it for

1443
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:32,290
time it was interesting those that I

1444
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:34,630
know who have done it said it's it's

1445
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:35,470
hard to do it the TIC to those schedules

1446
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:39,190
and make it work

1447
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:40,509
socially yeah yeah yeah John 10 years

1448
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:44,940
from now what are we talking about here

1449
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:48,880
I don't know what you're kidding

1450
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:50,860
Victoria I would say exiting issues I'm

1451
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:55,210
sorry equity yes I could be issues yes

1452
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:57,760
yes you are are only be be wealthy and

1453
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:59,950
well-to-do AVO your return answer cell

1454
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,660
yeah I mean today we're in the United

1455
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:04,740
States definitely grappling with the

1456
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:07,060
concept of universal health care and

1457
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:09,399
imagine you know 10 years 20 years hence

1458
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:11,049
when we have what could be arguably you

1459
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,790
know enhancement technologies on the

1460
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:14,410
market and there's no way that the

1461
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:15,730
government going to pay for those and

1462
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:17,020
that's going to be a bone of contention

1463
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:18,580
because you'll have people make the

1464
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:20,290
counter case that no no that's not a

1465
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:21,819
therapy that's that's right that's not

1466
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:23,410
an enhancer that's definitely a therapy

1467
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:24,970
and you should definitely be paying for

1468
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:26,890
this as part of you know state coverage

1469
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:29,140
so the government's already paying for

1470
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:30,368
things like that they're paying for cell

1471
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:32,259
phones for people that can't afford it

1472
01:01:30,369 --> 01:01:33,730
because there's no service right it's

1473
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:35,290
just some devices yeah yeah and they're

1474
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:36,430
paying you know libraries are places

1475
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:38,710
where you can go and access the internet

1476
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:40,629
so I think when one society gains a

1477
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:43,000
certain level you're going to get your

1478
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,990
you know your supercool commercial

1479
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,030
enhancement but then you have your

1480
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:47,470
government cheese version right because

1481
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:49,590
it's going to be required for society

1482
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:52,149
and just like you utila leader

1483
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:54,520
absolutely okay thanks and now

1484
01:01:52,150 --> 01:02:00,990
definitely open it up to some questions

1485
01:01:54,520 --> 01:02:00,990
and we had some yeah go ahead

1486
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:11,430
which is interesting I agree that the

1487
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:11,430
biggest worry

1488
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:34,129
yep so open devices and when you're

1489
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:36,560
talking about in vivo devices and so you

1490
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:38,540
know we're making a device mount called

1491
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:40,580
vivo key which is a Java card platform

1492
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:42,259
so you can load software apps onto it

1493
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:44,480
crypto apps things like that and kind of

1494
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:46,640
the ideas that you own your identity and

1495
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,619
part of the problem is that a certain

1496
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:51,020
section of that chip is off-limits to us

1497
01:02:48,619 --> 01:02:53,570
the JK comp operating system and so

1498
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:55,730
that's all controlled by n XP and we we

1499
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:58,130
can't touch it all of our apps that we

1500
01:02:55,730 --> 01:03:00,350
deploy our open source but that doesn't

1501
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:05,660
solve that problem that the operating

1502
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:07,250
system is closed it can however we it's

1503
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:09,350
above and beyond the capability of even

1504
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:11,119
a kick starter because to do that and to

1505
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:13,160
do it effectively when you're talking

1506
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:14,990
about a in vivo device you're dealing

1507
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,940
with very small spaces and very

1508
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:18,709
purpose-driven development of the

1509
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:19,369
hardware and so everything

1510
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:20,780
system-on-chip

1511
01:03:19,369 --> 01:03:23,270
you know if you're going to break it out

1512
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:26,210
and be far too large to put into body so

1513
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:28,430
to get a chip fab involved is millions

1514
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:30,650
and millions of dollars but there there

1515
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:32,299
is a drive there's already concerns and

1516
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:34,100
and thoughts of driving in that

1517
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:36,890
direction of being able to get your own

1518
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:39,290
chip created at a fab that's completely

1519
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:41,990
open everything's open that doesn't mean

1520
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:43,400
that the fab can't be playing evil made

1521
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:45,350
and put their own stuff I mean that

1522
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:47,150
happens a lot with a bunch of chips to

1523
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:49,279
go onto motherboards and whatnot but

1524
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:51,380
there is a drive to do that it's just

1525
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:57,100
we're at the baby steps now getting what

1526
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:57,100
we can yeah go ahead

1527
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:28,190
well the there is the president's

1528
01:04:25,849 --> 01:04:31,069
bioethics Commission and that was

1529
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:32,690
created why think it was Dolly the sheep

1530
01:04:31,069 --> 01:04:35,808
that actually inspired that first

1531
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:38,059
creation and then things like the

1532
01:04:35,809 --> 01:04:40,910
creation of Cynthia the first synthetic

1533
01:04:38,059 --> 01:04:43,640
cell that alarmed everyone that we

1534
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:45,440
created life wraps there was a huge

1535
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:48,049
hearing with the president's bioethics

1536
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:52,250
Commission I think for us in the United

1537
01:04:48,049 --> 01:04:54,079
States that is our Ethics Board for what

1538
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:56,000
we allow and don't allow at this point

1539
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:58,250
and it is because it's a bioethics

1540
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,690
Commission it's not law it doesn't do

1541
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:02,660
doesn't dictate what the law should

1542
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:04,640
become it's just really as as what we

1543
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:07,759
want and there are there any reasons we

1544
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:09,680
shouldn't do it so the President

1545
01:05:07,759 --> 01:05:12,559
appoints the members of that bioethics

1546
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:15,470
Commission if we wanted something that

1547
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:18,319
was less partisan perhaps we could get I

1548
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:20,720
think combined Commission which happens

1549
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:23,319
that is partly pointed by Congress

1550
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:25,819
partly appointed by the president so

1551
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:28,160
that's what I would suggest might be

1552
01:05:25,819 --> 01:05:30,799
another step is to make a more

1553
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:33,649
nonpartisan Commission it might be more

1554
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:36,319
universally interested in these issues

1555
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:38,480
there is a thorough science and tech

1556
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:40,609
boards in the military as well that

1557
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:43,099
don't feel very much with the with the

1558
01:05:40,609 --> 01:05:44,750
ethics issues but maybe we should maybe

1559
01:05:43,099 --> 01:05:46,220
start there because like I said I

1560
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:48,980
believe a lot of these come from the

1561
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:52,640
military a lot of the money goes into

1562
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:55,339
research DARPA and we could probably tap

1563
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:57,109
in earlier by going by that route

1564
01:05:55,339 --> 01:06:00,319
looking at ethics in the military as

1565
01:05:57,109 --> 01:06:03,259
well and thinking about it in that way

1566
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:04,700
but that's what I would do to increasing

1567
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:06,440
a personality of thinking about the

1568
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:08,990
ethics of this I think it's a great

1569
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:10,910
question by the way I mean that like the

1570
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:12,890
point you made as well like once we do

1571
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:14,629
start to have a more modified makeup

1572
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:17,900
about us should those individuals being

1573
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:19,160
included in in those panels and right

1574
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:21,230
now you're right it is up to the whim of

1575
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:24,259
the president and we saw under w bush

1576
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:26,089
rather backwards bioethics council and

1577
01:06:24,259 --> 01:06:28,009
now we are waiting with bated breath to

1578
01:06:26,089 --> 01:06:31,369
see what the President Trump does in

1579
01:06:28,009 --> 01:06:32,839
terms of that particular make up being

1580
01:06:31,369 --> 01:06:36,319
some like being a president who's

1581
01:06:32,839 --> 01:06:37,519
clearly anti science and we'll see where

1582
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:39,349
it goes that yes if we could make it

1583
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:41,269
anti-partisan yeah we're nonpartisan

1584
01:06:39,349 --> 01:06:44,589
rather that would be definitely a huge

1585
01:06:41,269 --> 01:06:44,589
step for it yeah go ahead

1586
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:50,009
that's a good question I'm thinking now

1587
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:51,920
about that that time line and I'm always

1588
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:54,390
mentioning how we are quickly more

1589
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:56,460
rapidly adapting technologies and

1590
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:58,650
beginning a TV took years for every

1591
01:07:56,460 --> 01:08:01,260
household to get one now every household

1592
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:02,970
is getting a new device much much faster

1593
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:04,769
you got a super curb so we can expect

1594
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:06,240
that to continue to happen so I'm

1595
01:08:04,769 --> 01:08:07,740
thinking the future of bioethics

1596
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:10,078
Commission is already going to be

1597
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:13,379
looking at adapted technologies by the

1598
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:14,760
time they even get to look at it so will

1599
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:18,440
a bioethics Commission be more a

1600
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:21,210
collective collection of norms

1601
01:08:18,439 --> 01:08:23,818
you know just assessing what's going on

1602
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:25,980
may we may be advancing so quickly with

1603
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:29,489
adaptation that a bioethics Commission

1604
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:31,408
is just trying to keep up with it so I

1605
01:08:29,488 --> 01:08:33,718
don't think they will set the norms

1606
01:08:31,408 --> 01:08:35,638
since my point I guess but they will

1607
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:37,439
discuss what I wanted to collect the

1608
01:08:35,639 --> 01:08:40,500
norms that we have now I don't see them

1609
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:42,719
setting norms so John you said you want

1610
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:48,000
so so one of the things meetings like

1611
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:51,170
this does is encourages universities

1612
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:55,738
with their scholars of varying stripes

1613
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:59,040
to become aware of and start to discuss

1614
01:08:55,738 --> 01:09:03,379
and explore and rigorously either study

1615
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:06,839
or analyze these sorts of issues and so

1616
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:10,620
I mean my response to your question is

1617
01:09:06,839 --> 01:09:14,130
how how will bioethics keep up with with

1618
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:20,729
body hacking or biotechnology whatever

1619
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:24,210
it it's it's basically a very old and

1620
01:09:20,729 --> 01:09:26,189
familiar mechanism which is goes for

1621
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:28,620
science as well as the humanities which

1622
01:09:26,189 --> 01:09:32,309
is a sort of division of intellectual

1623
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:36,778
labor the what one thing a plea that I

1624
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:41,069
could make to this audience is if you

1625
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:44,639
think what we do is important my field

1626
01:09:41,069 --> 01:09:48,620
needs bioethics needs financial support

1627
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:50,700
needs centralized you know federal

1628
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:52,920
grants support to

1629
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:55,559
do the kind of work that we do we tend

1630
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:58,590
to fall at the bottom of the barrel in

1631
01:09:55,560 --> 01:10:00,270
terms of commitments for research of

1632
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:02,790
this type which is unfortunate because

1633
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:06,600
in large part what we do is very

1634
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:09,720
inexpensive and many socially

1635
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:13,410
significant insights and analyses could

1636
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:15,660
be done for a relatively small financial

1637
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:17,340
commitment I think that's great if I

1638
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:20,269
just might cook up I going to interject

1639
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:22,170
myself here actually I can park it

1640
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:24,480
because it more of an anecdote but go

1641
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:25,950
ahead the federal funding I have a

1642
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:28,200
problem with that because you have to go

1643
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:30,330
to an IRB you have to follow all the

1644
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:32,160
federal requirements and you might have

1645
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:34,110
really run into some barriers with IR

1646
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:36,090
B's on this that's my only problem with

1647
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:38,070
federal funding but right that's really

1648
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:39,680
Banshees come from is a lot of federal

1649
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:42,929
funding but they would have to change

1650
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:45,780
this is the whole norm of you know

1651
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:47,790
medically required or that that's what I

1652
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:50,490
do to really experiment anything

1653
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:52,170
essentially yeah so essentially I'm I

1654
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:53,730
had an opportunity to meet with the FDA

1655
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:55,470
recently and all of our devices are

1656
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:58,139
non-medical they don't fall into three

1657
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:59,900
tenets of medical device so you know

1658
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:01,860
getting FDA approvals optional for us

1659
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:04,200
but what was interesting from the

1660
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:06,809
meeting is that the FDA it's very big

1661
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:08,160
bureaucratic institution but the thing

1662
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:10,770
that I walked away from the meeting with

1663
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:12,780
was there are several in the

1664
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:15,240
organization that they don't like to be

1665
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:18,809
surprised and so with bioethics board

1666
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:20,099
and FDA they're trying to vacuum up all

1667
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:21,270
the information of things happening

1668
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:23,070
independently out there and that's

1669
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:26,910
that's not a viable model as things

1670
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:30,299
increase in rapid rapidity so being more

1671
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:32,460
open and and maybe even offering funding

1672
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:34,260
for or incentivizing development of

1673
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:36,690
these technologies so they can be more

1674
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:38,610
engaging with these organizations I

1675
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:40,410
think would be interesting but so that

1676
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:42,179
you know in documented people the FDA

1677
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:45,000
like yeah we don't like to be surprised

1678
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:46,770
we much rather know about it and be

1679
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,050
prepared some will be less reactionary

1680
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:51,150
to it but on the other hand when it when

1681
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:53,040
I say okay how do we get engaged oh well

1682
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:54,570
then it's just super complicated and you

1683
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,460
know you got to pay much money to these

1684
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:58,170
independent review when really they're

1685
01:11:56,460 --> 01:12:00,210
just gatekeepers of the knowledge and if

1686
01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:03,900
the FDA was actually organized much

1687
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:04,320
better for accessibility it's small you

1688
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,490
know

1689
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,440
independent people could actually access

1690
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:09,510
those resources talk engage with them

1691
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:11,700
but it's it so bureaucratically shelled

1692
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:13,770
that these there's financial incentive

1693
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:16,590
for experts to be the gatekeepers to

1694
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:18,050
that and that was the the stopping point

1695
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:20,670
for us the roadblock was like well

1696
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:22,620
there's no point I don't have a million

1697
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:25,050
dollar budget to go talk to this expert

1698
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:27,930
who can help us through this process but

1699
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:29,280
there's a name for a malls concept which

1700
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:31,560
you all should be familiar with if

1701
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:34,950
you're not it's called citizen science

1702
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:37,920
and it's a very important thing for you

1703
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:39,809
all to consider yeah further to John's

1704
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,850
previous point about the funding for

1705
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:44,910
ethicists I also think there's a

1706
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:46,200
credibility problem for some reason at

1707
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:48,570
the system bioethicists in particular

1708
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:50,099
there's not part of the the popular

1709
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:51,570
conversation and astounds me I'm not

1710
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:53,670
quite sure why that should be the case

1711
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:55,759
and just one quick story about it kind

1712
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:58,290
of got me kind of thinking about that

1713
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:00,020
further to the work of the Chinese

1714
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:03,120
scientists as I was describing earlier

1715
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:05,040
it really created a holy moment

1716
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:07,470
here in the United States similar to

1717
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:09,269
Dali and Cynthia and of course even

1718
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:10,710
things like the first test-tube baby

1719
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:12,750
which we don't call test-tube babies

1720
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:19,230
anywheres now IVF of course the hysteria

1721
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:22,020
has died down but the very very

1722
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:24,959
concerned scientists and concerned

1723
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:29,070
individuals and citizens created a

1724
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:31,110
summit if you will in DC and what kind

1725
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:32,670
of Concerned me a little bit about it

1726
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:34,139
was the kind of demographic makeup of

1727
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:36,360
that summit it was basically all

1728
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:39,450
scientists there was one bioethicists

1729
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:41,460
was involved and I loved scientists of

1730
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:43,410
course I do but I sometimes find that

1731
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:46,260
they're not the best judges let's say of

1732
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:48,720
public policy of sort of you know of

1733
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:50,460
general analyses of society and the

1734
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:55,320
general thrust of you know where we're

1735
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:56,790
headed and perhaps well I was expecting

1736
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,690
actually the worst out of this summit

1737
01:13:56,790 --> 01:14:00,000
and I thought they were going to come

1738
01:13:57,690 --> 01:14:02,210
out of it with moratoriums and bands and

1739
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,710
this is that again we should not be

1740
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:08,970
working at all with you know human

1741
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:10,500
embryos with gene editing tools but to

1742
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:14,250
my astonishment they actually did come

1743
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:16,140
out of it with a roadmap to move forward

1744
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:18,030
we'll see if this roadmap now is going

1745
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:23,460
to be allowed to continue but

1746
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:26,610
here's kind of like a I guess a map to

1747
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:27,720
proceed based on ethical considerations

1748
01:14:26,610 --> 01:14:30,389
even let's say if these ethical

1749
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:32,550
considerations were predicated by the

1750
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:34,740
sensibilities of scientists and what

1751
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:37,980
they said was that yes we should be

1752
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:40,019
allowed to work on human embryos under

1753
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:41,549
his kind of strict set of criteria again

1754
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:42,840
you know make sure that there's consent

1755
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:45,240
make sure that the embers are destroyed

1756
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:46,680
after two days or whatever whatever

1757
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:51,090
whatever length that they have decided

1758
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:53,310
and most and most importantly they said

1759
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:55,380
that absolutely under no conditions

1760
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:57,480
should this embryo be implanted for you

1761
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:59,160
know full nine-month gestation as

1762
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,209
absolutely taboo at this point we may

1763
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:02,760
get there as you were alluding to at

1764
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:04,920
some point for whatever reason and to me

1765
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:06,180
that was actually huge because I mean

1766
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:08,070
scientists in the United States can

1767
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:09,660
actually get the green flag on this you

1768
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:11,490
guys can go ahead and you can actually

1769
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:12,990
you know work on human embryos with your

1770
01:15:11,490 --> 01:15:14,400
crisper and what other you know

1771
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:16,380
wonderful genetic tools that you might

1772
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:18,089
have so the only reason I bring up that

1773
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:20,010
particular story is I really wish that

1774
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:21,780
the summit the body there would have had

1775
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:23,310
a bit more inclusive with bioethicists

1776
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:25,230
what they do like that's what that's

1777
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:26,370
what they're trained to do that's what

1778
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:28,349
those are the most knowledgeable and

1779
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:30,240
there is this tension in my own mind

1780
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:31,740
these days you know when it comes to

1781
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:34,860
scientists trying to kind of influence

1782
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:36,330
of let's say avenues of research without

1783
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:38,429
being informed let's say by other

1784
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:40,050
informed parties so that's kind of my my

1785
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:42,380
take on the matter so I'll think one

1786
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:42,380
more question

1787
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:21,269
just the recent one that they've just

1788
01:16:20,130 --> 01:16:31,140
last week that was announced you're

1789
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:33,120
talking with ordinance yeah yeah if I

1790
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:35,060
might answer that question I actually

1791
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:37,620
think the answer that is no I think that

1792
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:40,050
chimeric research is as taboo if you

1793
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:41,580
will as it is working on embryos the

1794
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:42,930
thought of intermingling like reading

1795
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:44,519
kind of creating these transgenic

1796
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:46,830
organisms where you're mixing and

1797
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:48,480
matching genetic traits even let's say

1798
01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:51,090
if you've got a pig and you've now

1799
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:52,230
changed 0.001 percent of its genetic

1800
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:53,880
Constitution such as that you've

1801
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:55,110
included human characteristic that's

1802
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:57,870
still considered a chimera and a

1803
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:59,580
transgenic organism where we would let's

1804
01:16:57,870 --> 01:17:01,140
say it realistically realize oh that's

1805
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:02,640
nothing to be concerned about that's

1806
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:05,610
just a really minor change we're not

1807
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:06,900
talking half Pig half human but when you

1808
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:09,000
see the headlines and you see you know

1809
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:11,420
chimeric pig is half so it's got two men

1810
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,530
bits and pig bits is a hysteria about it

1811
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:15,450
what concerns me but that particular

1812
01:17:13,530 --> 01:17:17,190
line of research is ultimately what the

1813
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:20,550
goal is which is they want to grow human

1814
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:22,710
organs in a pig in a porcine model and

1815
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:24,150
I'm thinking isn't that kind of not

1816
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:24,780
where we want to be going like soon we

1817
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:26,639
be you're talking about

1818
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:27,900
regenerative medicine and other ways of

1819
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:29,940
you know we're growing our organs or

1820
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:31,830
even prosthetic organs just suddenly

1821
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:33,269
having this idea of farms filled with

1822
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:36,150
pigs that are growing hearts and livers

1823
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:39,230
and kidneys it's kind of dystopian to me

1824
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:42,410
and there is Laura Moreno a

1825
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:44,639
neurobiologist put out a paper out some

1826
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:46,650
stat magazine last week saying that

1827
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,420
there's other not only is there the the

1828
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:50,610
ethical issue as it pertains to what

1829
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:52,080
we're doing to these animals potentially

1830
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:53,910
humanizing these animals there's concern

1831
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:55,410
about actually kind of at a neurological

1832
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:58,320
level and downing them with maybe some

1833
01:17:55,410 --> 01:18:00,059
human level characteristics I personally

1834
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,349
don't believe that's happening but it is

1835
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:02,520
a worth it is a risk that's worth

1836
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:04,440
pointing out like my goodness could you

1837
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:06,360
imagine if the pig you know pigs are

1838
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:07,969
remarkably smart on their own we should

1839
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:10,110
assume that they're not you know

1840
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:12,060
I've heard it they're actually as smart

1841
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:14,219
as dogs for example not even smarter

1842
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:15,450
so the thought of actually adding let's

1843
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:16,890
say human characteristic might not

1844
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:18,599
actually improve their intelligence all

1845
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:20,100
that much but there is this kind of

1846
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,660
nightmare that you've created a pig with

1847
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:24,120
a human brain so basically what you've

1848
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:25,440
done is you've created ridiculous just

1849
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:27,930
to say that you've got a you know a

1850
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:30,809
human brain in a pig's body those are I

1851
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:32,280
think beyond the science and both in

1852
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:33,990
terms of what's possible but also in

1853
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:36,420
terms of the actual science that's being

1854
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:38,790
done so I think the wind from any of you

1855
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:41,100
guys wanted to chime in on that yeah I

1856
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:43,110
think the idea of considering a pig with

1857
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:45,660
human organs and farming human organs

1858
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:47,160
from pigs as somehow horrific is no more

1859
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:49,620
horrific than what pigs go through

1860
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:51,120
already yes there's no difference yes

1861
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:53,400
you take the heart out and then you get

1862
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,900
bacon I mean if you if you have eggs and

1863
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,429
bacon in the morning would you agree

1864
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:57,870
though that we should be moving to a way

1865
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:59,220
towards factory farming you know I did a

1866
01:18:57,870 --> 01:19:02,190
consumption of meat that comes from a

1867
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:04,530
livestock animals yeah I think the whole

1868
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:07,080
progression of animals meat or you know

1869
01:19:04,530 --> 01:19:08,969
lab meat basically is great and that's

1870
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:11,370
where we need to go I don't think that

1871
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:12,870
the research is binary I think that's

1872
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:15,630
you know they're probably looking at a

1873
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:18,000
stopgap measure before I agree after you

1874
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:20,520
know actual regenerative medicine that

1875
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,940
way but but yeah I think the overall

1876
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:26,910
drive of you know as human beings we are

1877
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:29,160
takers right from others it's just

1878
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:31,170
common and this is my like whole yeah

1879
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:34,500
you know my own s I guess kind of coming

1880
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:35,970
into play here but you know we use the

1881
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:38,790
environment and we consider ourselves

1882
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:41,340
above animals then just bottom line

1883
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:43,680
we're going to use them until there's no

1884
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:44,970
more use for them it's just yeah it's

1885
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:46,530
going to principle never going to stop

1886
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:48,780
one last thing that'll add to that sign

1887
01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:50,130
your organ donor cards people because

1888
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:51,840
that's why we're even talking about this

1889
01:19:50,130 --> 01:19:54,270
there is a matter of massive organ

1890
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:55,770
organs shortages here in the United

1891
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:57,570
States and if y'all just you know were

1892
01:19:55,770 --> 01:19:59,970
to sign that and have them forbid that

1893
01:19:57,570 --> 01:20:01,830
any of you would pass away such that you

1894
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:03,270
could be able to you know pass on that

1895
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:04,440
organ but that's altom Utley that's

1896
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:06,270
that's why we're talking about this

1897
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:08,759
ridiculousness of creating farms filled

1898
01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:10,980
with pigs with human organs and I have a

1899
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:13,400
question for the audience yeah please

1900
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:15,540
yeah okay given the trajectory of

1901
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:17,790
genetic research and cloning of Dolly

1902
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:20,010
and all that and then the supposed

1903
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:21,150
moratorium how many people think that

1904
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:25,700
rogue scientists of

1905
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:27,120
already created human clones hmm I

1906
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:29,010
believe that too

1907
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:31,230
I think they're trying I want to examine

1908
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:33,120
I think it's okay like literally like

1909
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:35,219
walking in a monks no I don't I think

1910
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:37,620
they've been brought to term and then

1911
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:39,720
probably either put on ice for organ

1912
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:41,670
harvesting or some other horrible

1913
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:44,370
outcome but I think it's happened yeah I

1914
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:45,990
don't think a moratorium stopped we are

1915
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:47,970
doing it with animals we are doing our

1916
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:49,980
mouth all the time yeah yeah the same

1917
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:51,690
science the science even a commercial

1918
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:54,209
service now we're in China we can clone

1919
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:55,679
your dog yeah there was a sort of peer

1920
01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:57,090
in this days for a while did it for some

1921
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:58,830
reason it died out I'm not sure why yeah

1922
01:20:57,090 --> 01:21:02,010
people creeped out there there is a UN

1923
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:03,300
treaty against human cloning I wanted to

1924
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:04,950
throw that out there yeah that's pure to

1925
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:06,900
get us against the law absolutely yeah

1926
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:08,220
you underground in Canada by the way

1927
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:10,230
it's also against the law to do any kind

1928
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:14,010
of chimeric transgenic really absolutely

1929
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:15,870
I'm Canadian and this is the Charter

1930
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:17,250
that we have that was set up is now kind

1931
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:19,500
of archaic it was set up now like

1932
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:22,820
thanked 15 years ago 20 years ago it has

1933
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:25,110
not kept up with the changes in

1934
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:26,639
technology and it's still quite it's

1935
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:28,469
very backwards and it needs a massive

1936
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:29,880
overhaul but not no one absolutely no

1937
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:31,920
one was even talking about that in

1938
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:33,600
Canada right now so call Trudeau get

1939
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:37,770
them on yeah yeah all right like sceptre

1940
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:38,940
bright about I do understand stuff a

1941
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:40,530
little bit not some questions um

1942
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:42,089
otherwise we're I think we're running

1943
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:44,509
out of time I don't want to be yeah like

1944
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:44,510
this go ahead

1945
01:21:50,840 --> 01:22:04,130
a real-world example family a hacker

1946
01:21:59,449 --> 01:22:08,589
first child a child the fact that they

1947
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:11,719
wanted to address and the therapy was

1948
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:15,170
was difficult because they would need a

1949
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:18,100
bone marrow transplant from a donor that

1950
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:20,650
had acidic properties

1951
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:23,710
and would be very difficult to do that

1952
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:26,740
so the reference to find that particular

1953
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:31,660
doubt so the recommendation why if they

1954
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:35,710
wanted to have another child will be

1955
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:37,039
provided left genetically the kind of

1956
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:40,719
child

1957
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:40,719
and then when that Java form

1958
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:49,450
my therapy cheese personality which they

1959
01:22:44,870 --> 01:23:10,630
did in the first table to work so

1960
01:22:49,450 --> 01:23:13,120
I don't see that any difference in that

1961
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:14,500
than having nine kids to run the farm I

1962
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:17,769
walked on the farm

1963
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:19,540
well said I don't see that is any

1964
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:23,800
different than having nine kids to work

1965
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:25,360
on the farm Oren Fox come yeah I I

1966
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:28,270
happen to agree I don't I don't think

1967
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:30,910
it's ethically dubious territory I guess

1968
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:32,530
at the most severus level you could say

1969
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:34,389
this child was a means to an end

1970
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:36,040
but ultimately if the parents are there

1971
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:37,960
to you know love and take care of that

1972
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:39,960
child and raise them and I have

1973
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:42,340
absolutely no issue with that yeah

1974
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:44,020
further de cloning as well I also think

1975
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:47,320
that that's also it's like you said it's

1976
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:50,560
against international law very serious

1977
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:52,000
but what's the big deal about it and we

1978
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,650
already we're already seeing through

1979
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,290
popular culture through shows like

1980
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:59,170
orphan black and this positive portrayal

1981
01:23:56,290 --> 01:24:00,850
of cloning where we're already we're

1982
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:02,170
kind of relaxing about it whereas maybe

1983
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:03,880
twenty years ago they would have been

1984
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:05,290
the monsters in our movies now the kind

1985
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:07,270
of the heroes in our movies in our shows

1986
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:08,950
I just want to clarify that a treaty

1987
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:10,570
it's government to government so it

1988
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:12,429
doesn't make it a crime for you to do it

1989
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:14,110
but it's between nations so nations are

1990
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:14,440
not supposed to allow it I think you got

1991
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:16,450
it

1992
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:18,759
I think cloning is one of the biggest

1993
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:22,179
non issues right now in bioethics and it

1994
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:25,720
says today the only reason that becomes

1995
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:27,850
an issue is because the the idea being

1996
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:29,380
that only the rich are going to start

1997
01:24:27,850 --> 01:24:32,230
this process and they're going to

1998
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:34,210
essentially make Lamar Gentiles yeah you

1999
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:35,860
hear their organ acutest yeah a great

2000
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:37,810
army of like Hitler's or something I'm

2001
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:39,730
not an army but your own personal organ

2002
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:41,800
donor right oh I see you got show you

2003
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:43,780
make a clone of yourself but you piss it

2004
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:45,310
and you keep it alive you're like cool I

2005
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:47,950
got a heart that's against the law

2006
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:53,500
yeah more there's a lot of boys doing

2007
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:56,139
horrible - if I did

2008
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:57,699
yeah but you also hear these kinds of

2009
01:24:56,139 --> 01:24:59,260
you know really judgy sorts of things

2010
01:24:57,699 --> 01:25:01,419
when it comes about or like why would

2011
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:02,980
you know someone be so arrogant and so

2012
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:04,599
narcissistic to produce a clone of

2013
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:06,730
themselves I might well that's not up to

2014
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:09,219
you to decide like that that's what they

2015
01:25:06,730 --> 01:25:10,659
want to do like raise a twin basically

2016
01:25:09,219 --> 01:25:13,000
raise their twin that's a generational

2017
01:25:10,659 --> 01:25:15,280
that's generation you know removed how

2018
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,400
could I be so much better if I raised me

2019
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:20,440
yeah yeah I think it'd be fascinating

2020
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:21,879
much of raising yourself I I'll never do

2021
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:23,409
what my parents did to me ice cream ice

2022
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:24,520
my own version my mind a little version

2023
01:25:23,409 --> 01:25:27,250
of myself and what I think it's probably

2024
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:29,409
more uh more likely that a parents will

2025
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:31,030
try to clone a dead child like like they

2026
01:25:29,409 --> 01:25:33,039
have an accident something do you have a

2027
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:34,840
problem none yeah well I mean they're

2028
01:25:33,039 --> 01:25:37,269
they're essentially trying to replace

2029
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:40,210
their child it's not going to be same

2030
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:42,150
cognitive development great would you

2031
01:25:40,210 --> 01:25:44,469
say these parents are misguided then

2032
01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:48,808
well I would say that their expectations

2033
01:25:44,469 --> 01:25:51,880
are not going to line with reality

2034
01:25:48,809 --> 01:25:54,099
they're often misguided patient parents

2035
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:56,949
out there if there are be that odd right

2036
01:25:54,099 --> 01:25:59,770
true enough sure enough and of course

2037
01:25:56,949 --> 01:26:02,769
cloning also allows let's say same-sex

2038
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:04,239
couples to have a biological mouth

2039
01:26:02,770 --> 01:26:06,670
spring if that's important to them which

2040
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:10,360
for many it obviously really is or you

2041
01:26:06,670 --> 01:26:12,309
know um Leslie turns out on that one but

2042
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:13,900
there there are I would say valid

2043
01:26:12,309 --> 01:26:15,940
reasons for allowing in sanctioning

2044
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:17,829
human cloning that's just my own figure

2045
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:19,480
that okay I'm worrying that we're moving

2046
01:26:17,829 --> 01:26:20,320
over time it is exactly one of collab

2047
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:24,750
we've been in here for ninety minutes

2048
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:24,750
and has been amazing thank you
