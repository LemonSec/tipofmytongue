1
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,889
glad to be back here at body hacking con

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,570
this is my second year here I was

3
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:16,860
speaking here last year on sleep I was

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,930
kind of curious as to how many people

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,970
would show up for a sleep talk at a body

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,340
hacking con had a great turnout last

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,448
year and had a great feedback from it so

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,029
they invited me to come back this year

9
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:30,920
and what I wanted to talk about this

10
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:33,720
year is genomics genomics is an area of

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,570
medicine that I practice precision

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:40,019
medicine I work as a concierge physician

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,180
doing precision wellness I don't

14
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:44,159
generally work in the disease model so

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,129
we work in human performance and

16
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:51,000
optimization model at the appear on

17
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:53,760
Center which is one of the places that

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,150
my wife and I founded we also have they

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,400
appear on Academy these are our two

20
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:02,839
businesses I have a podcast called the

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:07,140
Ironman executive for biohackers it's a

22
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:09,000
definite place to go to listen I talk to

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,470
a lot of the top scientists in the field

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,890
of human performance and human

25
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:17,189
optimization a lot of transhumanists

26
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:20,969
Zoltan Istvan a lot of the geneticists

27
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:24,538
that are researching aging and enhancing

28
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:28,380
human development but today I want to

29
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:29,939
talk about genomics and really before I

30
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,990
can get into it I want to give you guys

31
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:39,449
a kind of a about a 10 minute background

32
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:43,079
on what genomics is so we have the the

33
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:45,659
cellular gnomes that's the code so if

34
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,809
you think of a computer we have a code

35
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,119
in in embedded in there and that's the

36
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,329
genome the microbiome and the viral and

37
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,840
you can break that down further in the

38
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,279
in the genome to things like the

39
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:04,170
proteome the transcriptome the

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:07,770
metabolomic code that you have ok that's

41
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,270
embedded code we are just now starting

42
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,160
to figure out how to actually change

43
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,140
that code through CRISPR technology

44
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,840
where we can edit the code but

45
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,149
essentially the code is what you work

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,040
from so that's the base that you build

47
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,330
everything from then we have the

48
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,489
biosphere achill world

49
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:27,570
or the inputs that we have so we have

50
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:29,790
energy inputs into this this functioning

51
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,310
machine we have the functions of the

52
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,840
machine itself we have the mind and we

53
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,470
have the environment that we behave in

54
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:41,970
and it's important to understand that

55
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:44,550
from a from a DNA level every cell in

56
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:47,310
your body is constantly assessing the

57
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:50,040
environment in making changes in the

58
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,080
expression of that genome in order to

59
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,510
accommodate that environment that you're

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,110
existing in so it's a constant

61
00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:00,929
interaction that's occurring and we are

62
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,880
now in this whole new world of medicine

63
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,740
that is just exploding I mean this is

64
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,720
amazing what we've been able to

65
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,370
accomplish I mean CRISPR technology this

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,980
gene editing technologies like word

67
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,560
processors I mean you just go in and you

68
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,530
say I want to copy and paste this gene

69
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,910
code and put it in there their concern

70
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,350
because they think that this stuff it

71
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:23,430
can actually be done in basement

72
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:27,959
laboratories it's so simple to do and in

73
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:31,980
fact my podcast I interviewed the chair

74
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,200
of the gene doping board for the world

75
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,850
anti-doping Association because of the

76
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,160
gene doping that was occurring in the

77
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,079
Rio Olympics where people were adding

78
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,480
genes into their genome for performance

79
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,120
and it's very primitive right now but

80
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,660
what's coming it's gonna be quite

81
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,450
impressive but we want to talk about the

82
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,880
things that we can do that can actually

83
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,010
influence the expression of that code

84
00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:00,450
and how we can look at our own codes and

85
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:04,410
figure out what we can do to enhance our

86
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:06,810
individual performance so the code of

87
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,570
life ATC and G did anybody watch the

88
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:12,750
movie Gattaca yeah you know what Gattaca

89
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:16,469
is stands for it's the codes the genetic

90
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,918
code just rearranged so ATC and G is the

91
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,660
life code so we have these paired

92
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:23,729
deoxyribonucleic acids has been the code

93
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,180
of life for 4.5 million years until

94
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:28,919
recently when a lab created their own

95
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,800
code they added two letters to it they

96
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:34,859
call it a X&Y so we've actually created

97
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,100
life we are now the architects of our

98
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,530
own

99
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,650
evolution we can change things we have

100
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:44,460
created life we're gods okay and we've

101
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:48,440
got to get good at it so when we look at

102
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:51,239
our individual genomes we have 46

103
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,810
chromosomes that's 23 paired chromosomes

104
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,810
in that our genome has 3 billion of

105
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:01,830
those base pairs as 80 CS and G's there

106
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:05,010
are 3 billion of those now out of that 3

107
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:09,450
billion we only have 23,000 genes

108
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:14,099
I mean rice has more genes than Homo

109
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:16,050
Sapien rice has like 32,000 genes so the

110
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,960
number of genes doesn't translate into

111
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:22,290
complexity of the organism but how those

112
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,409
genes are expressed and how they change

113
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,210
in the process of post transcription

114
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,470
that should say which will get into an

115
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:32,280
epigenetics here in a minute

116
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:34,890
it's what codes for the complexity but

117
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,260
out of those 23,000 genes were able to

118
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:41,580
make over a million different proteins

119
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:44,310
through modifications so those 23,000

120
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,330
little pieces of code somehow end up

121
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:50,610
creating over a million proteins and

122
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:52,500
within those 3 billion base pairs

123
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,470
there's what we call these single

124
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,270
nucleotide polymorphisms there's 10

125
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,420
million of those about one in every 300

126
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:02,669
base pairs is considered this this is

127
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:06,620
what makes each of us different these

128
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,620
aren't mutations these are variations

129
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,700
and I'm going to get into single

130
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,289
nucleotide polymorphisms in a minute but

131
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,810
I want to talk to you about this first

132
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:18,060
because this is what we normally think

133
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,740
of when we think of our genetics that's

134
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,070
what those chromosomes look like right

135
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,620
well that's only at one point in a cell

136
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,690
cycle and string mitosis that the

137
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,010
chromosomes look like that the rest of

138
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,440
the time they look like this spaghetti

139
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:35,250
here okay this is their clumped

140
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,780
chromatin and in there you can see you

141
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,270
have the DNA strand it wraps around

142
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,789
histones and the histones coil and then

143
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,830
you have this solenoid chromatin fiber

144
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:46,050
and you know this is what it looks like

145
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,330
during division but the rest of the time

146
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,950
it looks like this just this bowl of

147
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,349
spaghetti

148
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:55,039
there and this is important as we get

149
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:57,920
into this a little further so of those

150
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,050
base pairs then we have these letters

151
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:04,010
and ever anybody here had their 23andme

152
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:06,290
done yeah and several of you you get

153
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:08,539
letters so you find these genes and you

154
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:12,740
have letters you have a and C or C and C

155
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,910
or a a and what it is is it is one

156
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,530
chromosome from your mother and one

157
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,690
chromosome from your father and they're

158
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,849
looking at a specific location on the

159
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:22,760
chromosomes and matching those so if

160
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:25,220
your parents had an AC and an AC at

161
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,010
those regions then the egg and sperm

162
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,030
would have an A or a C and a or a C and

163
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,130
you can come up with all these

164
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:37,460
combinations

165
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:39,409
this is inheritance and here is where we

166
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,140
talk about what makes each of us

167
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:45,950
different is the single nucleotide

168
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:51,650
polymorphism 99% of the entire world

169
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:55,310
population has identical base pairs well

170
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:58,940
99 percent of each of us has the

171
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,920
equivalent base pairs so there's only 1%

172
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,590
difference in your code from your

173
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,870
neighbors code from the guy in China

174
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:10,070
from the guy in Africa from the guy in

175
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:13,070
Iceland there's only 1% different but

176
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:15,770
that 1% is what makes us each an

177
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,060
individual and that's what we look at

178
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,979
when we look at single nucleotide

179
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,380
polymorphisms these are not mutations

180
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:25,040
these are not major inheritable disease

181
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,960
processes these are minor variations in

182
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:30,610
the expression of genes or the function

183
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:35,750
of genes that are coded in this genome

184
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:38,300
and you can see when we look at a gene

185
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:41,630
there are different segments of a gene

186
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:43,640
there are the non-coding portions of the

187
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,170
genome then you have the regulatory

188
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,939
sequences of the genome then you have

189
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,530
the coding region of the genome and then

190
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,250
you have the termination sequence of the

191
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:55,100
gene so you're you've got a lot of

192
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,600
controls placed in along there and you

193
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,180
can have variations in those base pairs

194
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,770
at any point you know mutations up here

195
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,239
in this non-coding region typically

196
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:05,590
don't create any risk

197
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,660
but when they're in the coding region of

198
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:11,860
the gene they can change your protein

199
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:14,079
and gets a little more complex than the

200
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,760
head even because within each coding

201
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:21,880
segment of a gene of what's called

202
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:25,720
introns and exons this is an editing

203
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,830
portion so the when a gene is read off

204
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,890
of your DNA

205
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:31,690
it creates an RNA strand and creates a

206
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:35,800
messenger RNA well the messenger RNA

207
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:38,140
edits out portions of that code to make

208
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,439
a viable code because these introns are

209
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:44,920
thrown away the interesting thing is

210
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,660
when you look at genetic variations when

211
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,790
we look at whole genome sequencing and

212
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,670
we look at population genetics one of

213
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:55,270
the most common variations for obesity

214
00:09:51,670 --> 00:10:00,069
is the FTO gene there's one region

215
00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:01,930
called the RS 9 9 3 9 6 or 9 and it's

216
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,510
potent I mean if you carry a certain

217
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,010
variant of that your odds of obesity are

218
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:11,170
really high because you have high

219
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:14,290
appetite low satiety habitual eating so

220
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:16,260
when you have that you tend to have that

221
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:20,020
response well the interesting thing is

222
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:23,530
that base pair is actually in an intron

223
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:26,380
it doesn't even code for anything so

224
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:28,390
we're like whoa this is confusing how

225
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,360
can that have such an effect on our

226
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:34,090
bodies when it doesn't code for anything

227
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,590
well it turns out that these introns can

228
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,020
function in different ways in the body

229
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:40,840
they can change the expression of the

230
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:45,310
genes in certain ways and that is

231
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:47,110
epigenetics so when we have a base pair

232
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,760
code that's in the coding genome and you

233
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:52,030
have an eighty there and it gets changed

234
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,370
to a GC it can change the folding of

235
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,839
these proteins so you may have a coding

236
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:58,620
region for a gene that's a hundred and

237
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:02,830
fifty thousand base pairs it codes for

238
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:04,840
20,000 amino acids on a protein but the

239
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,970
sequence of that is those amino acids

240
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:10,300
change how it folds how to interacts

241
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:12,040
with receptors how other molecules

242
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,729
interact with it so it changes the

243
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,529
function of that protein when you

244
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,170
these and this is what we can find when

245
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:22,260
we do our own genomic research we start

246
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:26,099
looking at our own genes we can start

247
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:29,130
seeing these variations and determine

248
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:32,130
what we're prone to and it's probability

249
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:35,430
base it's very cool I've done this on

250
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:37,740
over 1,500 of my clients and the

251
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,540
predictability is amazing with this and

252
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:43,170
I only look at about 500 different

253
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:45,329
variations within the genome and I can

254
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:48,510
predict their appetite I can predict

255
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:52,739
sugar addictions I can predict what kind

256
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:54,209
of macronutrient patterns they do best

257
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,800
with you know are you going to respond

258
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:57,420
best to a high saturated fat or a low

259
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,240
saturated fat or you're going to respond

260
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:03,410
best to high protein or low protein with

261
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,500
predictability it's not accuracy

262
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:10,079
precision but it's predictability

263
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:13,010
probabilities with this so don't get

264
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:16,439
confused with this code dictates your

265
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:19,860
destiny it does not and that's what we

266
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,690
get into it with epigenetics so we have

267
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,389
snips we have exomes and we have whole

268
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:27,720
genome sequencing snips is what you get

269
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:32,220
with 23andme on the backend of 23andme

270
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:34,769
there are 900,000 genetics snips or base

271
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,750
pairs that are coded you can go in there

272
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:38,490
and research that on your own it's very

273
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,589
simple to do if you know what you're

274
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,300
looking for they don't tell you about

275
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:45,180
that you have to go into the browser all

276
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:48,420
data section and find that then you have

277
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:51,479
XM XM analysis like companies like

278
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:55,199
Gino's where they will actually look at

279
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,760
whole protein coding sequences those are

280
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:58,769
more for mutations those aren't

281
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,260
necessarily for lifestyle variations

282
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:03,660
those are looking for major impact

283
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,850
heritable disease traits that you're

284
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,949
going to carry and then you have the

285
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,389
whole genome sequencing which is coming

286
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:11,939
down in price for getting down under

287
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:13,709
$1,000 to get your entire 3 billion base

288
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,910
pair sequence and once you have it you

289
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,989
never have to get it tested again

290
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,740
because it's not going to change unless

291
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:21,269
you edit it somehow but it's there so

292
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,829
it's a one-time test it's pretty cool

293
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:26,699
because you can then take that and

294
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:28,920
upload it into different things so most

295
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:31,349
of the studies on genetics are done we

296
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:34,400
what's called genome-wide Association

297
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:37,110
studies and here's where I talk about

298
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,090
probabilities so you have this group of

299
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,520
people that have a trait you have this

300
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,960
group of people who are controls and you

301
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,319
measure the percentage of the people

302
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,240
that have a certain code they carried

303
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,860
that trait and if you see a probability

304
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,700
it's 60 percent of the people who have

305
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,960
obesity carried this code whereas only

306
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,450
40 percent of the control population

307
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,370
carry it you have an association that's

308
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:02,130
what's called a genome-wide Association

309
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,990
study that's what most of the

310
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:07,110
predictability of this is based on so

311
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,610
you can see you know even though 62

312
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,320
percent of the population has a case

313
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,390
there's 38 percent of them that carry

314
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:18,900
that same code that don't have that

315
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:20,490
trait so it's probabilities and this is

316
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,010
how it's done I mean generally you have

317
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,680
a variation in the genetic code it

318
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:27,420
creates a gene and a protein it causes a

319
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,060
cellular process to occur and then you

320
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,800
get a trade but what we do when we do

321
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,359
the genome-wide Association study is we

322
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,089
look at that variation and we look at

323
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,940
traits so we bypass this whole segment

324
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:40,589
here as to what's actually happening and

325
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,600
just saying well we're seeing an

326
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:44,100
association it's not necessarily

327
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:49,589
causation but there is an association

328
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:53,160
here now this is the really cool stuff

329
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:58,580
this is where you guys have the ability

330
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:02,969
to create change you guys are truly the

331
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:05,970
architects of your evolution we

332
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:08,960
underestimate our ability to change our

333
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:11,790
genes the expression of these genes

334
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:15,720
every gene in our body is on a dimmer

335
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:18,660
switch can be turned on it can be turned

336
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,150
off it can be up regulated and it can be

337
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:25,260
down regulated depending on what you do

338
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:29,699
and the trick is figuring out how to do

339
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:31,170
it and that's what we work with so

340
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,550
there's all these different ways gene

341
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,800
expression can be changed

342
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:36,630
it says how this at the cellular level

343
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,900
this is the biochemical level as to

344
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:41,910
what's happening but let's talk about

345
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:45,660
how modifiable

346
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:50,790
this genetic code truly is think about

347
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:54,120
this you have these honeybees worker

348
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:57,050
queen and drone they all possess the

349
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:01,100
exact same genetic code

350
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:04,589
you know how the queen becomes a queen

351
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:07,020
royal honey their royal jelly is the

352
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:11,220
royal jelly has something in it that

353
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:16,610
inhibits a gene of the nmt it's a

354
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:20,580
demethylation the acetylation gene an

355
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:22,020
aged act by interfering with that it

356
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:25,680
changes the expression of the rest of

357
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:29,760
the genome so she gets to live 20 years

358
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:33,689
and these guys live usually a couple of

359
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:39,140
weeks changes that completely this is

360
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:42,170
another extreme example same exact code

361
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:46,110
and yet you see completely different

362
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:48,930
expressions of that code in the same

363
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:50,190
organism it's not like you know they

364
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,030
start off this way and they stay that

365
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:55,770
way this is one that actually transforms

366
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:58,620
its actual phenotypic expression anybody

367
00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:00,480
watch them this show Lucy where she can

368
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,770
actually change her appearance and

369
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,390
that's essentially what we're talking

370
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:06,329
about here when a caterpillar goes into

371
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:09,690
a butterfly but that's the genetic code

372
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:11,819
we all every form of life that we are

373
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:15,510
aware of on this earth possesses the

374
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:19,139
same four letters a T C and G it's exact

375
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:21,859
same code as biologic organisms we

376
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,540
shouldn't age we are programmed to age

377
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:27,300
it's not a process of gradual

378
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,950
deterioration there's animals in the

379
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,840
animal kingdom that do not age at all

380
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,490
there's plants that don't age at all

381
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,800
five hundred year old plant is no

382
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,150
different than the five year old plant

383
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,190
from an aging process because it's a

384
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:42,390
biological organism biologic organisms

385
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:45,000
can re can rejuvenate without any

386
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:48,330
problems the only reason we age is

387
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,040
because we're programmed to do so it's

388
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,970
in our genes it's a community-based

389
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,639
survival and yet there are even

390
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,500
organisms that can reverse age

391
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:03,240
you can actually go back to a pupil form

392
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:06,690
a true Benjamin Button style so this

393
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:11,220
this genome once we figure out how to

394
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:17,780
control it we will have amazing outcomes

395
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:20,460
that we can approach so when we look at

396
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,678
what we are capable of doing that

397
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,770
interacts with our genome that has an

398
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:28,530
effect on our outcome we look at these

399
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:31,740
seven major categories sleep stress

400
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:34,370
nutrition hormones movement and exercise

401
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:37,440
the environment we exist in in the mind

402
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:39,959
all of these have an effect on the

403
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:44,250
expression of our genes to create an

404
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:48,740
outcome think about every cell in this

405
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:51,990
in your body every individual cell is

406
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:54,450
constantly assessing what's happening in

407
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,909
its external environment just like you

408
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,500
you walk outside and it's raining you go

409
00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:01,200
back inside you grab a raincoat or grab

410
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,870
an umbrella all of our cells are the

411
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,760
same way if they sense a lot of stress

412
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,399
hormones circulating in the external

413
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,440
environment they change the expression

414
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,870
of the genes that are occurring inside

415
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,360
the cell

416
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:20,010
chronic stress chronic change in gene

417
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,299
expressions sometimes permanent so

418
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:25,049
there's all these things that we're

419
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:28,260
doing right now that can change the

420
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:32,389
expression of the genes or even seeing

421
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:36,179
things like posture if you stand

422
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:39,659
shoulders back chest out spine erect

423
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:44,070
chin down slightly you will change the

424
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:46,890
expression of genes in your body it also

425
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:49,980
changes your thought processes I mean

426
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:53,299
the body is an amazing sensing organism

427
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:58,110
all aspects of it we aren't just one

428
00:19:53,299 --> 00:20:00,570
organism or colony all of us we have

429
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,549
bacteria that work with us and on top of

430
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:06,090
the microbiome which is ten times the

431
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:07,580
number of human cells we have the vairam

432
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,059
which is ten times more than the

433
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:13,918
microbiome which there

434
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:16,139
is now researching all interacting so

435
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,049
all of this stuff interacts in an

436
00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:21,269
environmental biospheric or form that we

437
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:27,649
want to optimize in order to have

438
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:29,639
optimal health nutria genetics is

439
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:32,029
frequently people will say nutrigenomics

440
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:35,070
when they mean neutral genetics and

441
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:37,259
nutria genetics is actually eating for

442
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:40,259
your genes so if we look at your genetic

443
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:43,049
code and we say you know what you've got

444
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:45,299
an ape OE for genotype you probably will

445
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:46,889
have a high incidence of Alzheimer's

446
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:49,549
disease and heart disease if you eat

447
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:51,719
high saturated fat Heello saturated fat

448
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:53,519
that's nutria genetics so you're

449
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,480
altering your diet to match what your

450
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:59,909
genes actually code for in your body

451
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,129
with that we can actually tell somebody

452
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:03,629
should be high carb low carb what kind

453
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:05,998
of fats they should consume how much

454
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:08,908
protein what they're prone to from an

455
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:10,440
appetite satiety there's actually a gene

456
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:14,399
called we call it the sugar addiction

457
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:17,490
gene it's called TAS to our 38 and it's

458
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:20,518
a cool gene because if you have the a a

459
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:23,159
variant of this this particular region

460
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:26,369
of the gene your what we call the the

461
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:27,690
cookie addict if you have a cookie jar

462
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:29,519
you going to eat a cookie out of it

463
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,200
you'll keep going back to that cookie

464
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:32,929
jar until it's gone and not have any

465
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,289
awareness that you're even doing it

466
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:39,960
people mistake that for having lack of

467
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:42,179
willpower but it's actually in this gene

468
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,440
when you have this variant and use taste

469
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:48,869
sugar that that stimulus turns off

470
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:52,110
inhibition of appetite so you have no

471
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:55,439
appetite feedback at all it's just go

472
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:59,248
eat it's interesting we see quite a bit

473
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,049
of it mostly in females the it expresses

474
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:03,119
higher in females than it does in males

475
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:05,908
males will be like potato chips and

476
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:10,110
crackers guys females though they're the

477
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:12,659
cookies now nutrigenomics

478
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:14,639
which is a term you hear a lot about now

479
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:16,139
nutria genomics is actually altering

480
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:18,719
your gene expression by taking certain

481
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:20,219
nutrients or supplements this is a

482
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,690
really cool field because this is an

483
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,500
area where we can actually change

484
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,870
expression

485
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,280
of genes we can up regulate and down

486
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:29,280
regulate expressions we can enhance

487
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,840
expressions we can optimize expressions

488
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,120
specifically for the goals that we want

489
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:36,299
to achieve just a simple example

490
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,870
fructose will alter brain gene

491
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:42,780
expressions in a very negative way and

492
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:45,870
we can actually reverse that by taking

493
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:48,270
high doses of omega-3 DHA and it

494
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:51,090
actually reverses that Network change

495
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:53,280
that occurs in the people taking the

496
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,658
high fructose diet well I mean fructose

497
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,950
you get it in a lot of places I mean

498
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:59,250
it's what you get predominantly from

499
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:04,470
fruits and believe it or not it's not

500
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:06,780
the best thing for us some other

501
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:09,450
examples one of my favorite supplements

502
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:13,980
but co-commentary up regulates

503
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:15,750
glutathione which is our our oxidative

504
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,880
stress system you know all these people

505
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,370
take all these high-dose antioxidants

506
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,049
it's the worst thing you can do really

507
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:23,639
high dose antioxidants are probably good

508
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:24,960
for the couch potato that doesn't do

509
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,580
anything but they're not the ones that

510
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,970
tend to take high dose antioxidants it's

511
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,710
usually that people focus on health and

512
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:34,320
you're overriding a management system

513
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:36,600
the body that is designed to really help

514
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,820
keep you healthy I mean think about it

515
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:42,510
when you exercise you produce more free

516
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:45,510
radicals than any other time and it's

517
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:47,460
beneficial you get better strength and

518
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:50,370
you get better longevity from those free

519
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,750
radicals when you scavenge all your free

520
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,489
radicals you take the bullets out of the

521
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:56,760
gun of the white cells that they use to

522
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:58,830
kill tumors and bacteria so you don't

523
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,270
want to go overboard on this you want to

524
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:02,340
enhance the system that's there to

525
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:06,270
manage this I mean if you want another

526
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:10,559
truth we make 1 times 10 to the 24th

527
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:14,158
free radicals a day in our body that's

528
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:15,960
one with 24 zeros after it that's the

529
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,159
average number of free radicals we

530
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,559
produce and there's no way we're gonna

531
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,659
scavenge them that well but let the body

532
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,490
do it keep the body healthy keep it

533
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:25,380
functioning well that's most of the

534
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:27,830
stuff really well on its own without us

535
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:30,630
having to interfere believe it or not

536
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:33,809
choline choline is another common one

537
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:36,090
that we like to see there's a lot of

538
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:36,550
data on this one suggesting that

539
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,740
maternal

540
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:40,300
choline intake in humans modulates the

541
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,820
epigenetic state of the genes that

542
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:47,050
regulate fetal stress accesses

543
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:49,510
reactivity we also find that women who

544
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:52,060
have genes that code for an inability to

545
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:54,070
produce choline well will generally be

546
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:56,730
told you know what your baby's not

547
00:24:54,070 --> 00:25:01,629
thriving on your breast milk you need to

548
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:04,360
give supplements or do bottle feeding

549
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:05,830
and yet all they needed was more choline

550
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,300
because their body wasn't producing it

551
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:10,570
the baby needs a lot of choline to

552
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:12,790
thrive in the early stages holy basil

553
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:16,480
holy basil another one of my favorites

554
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:19,389
holy basil also called Tulsi active

555
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,490
components your Solek acid this actually

556
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,960
you can take this and it's like exercise

557
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:25,960
the brain thinks you're exercising when

558
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,590
you take holy basil because in the in

559
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:33,100
the muscle it produces this stuff called

560
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:34,480
fndc fndc v which goes to the liver gets

561
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,540
converted to iris and goes to the brain

562
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,210
brain says oh they're exercising here's

563
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,350
B D and F B D and F is a wonderful thing

564
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:45,160
in the brain it's called brain derived

565
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:47,590
neurotrophic factor and it is amazing it

566
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,510
actually goes in and inhibit these d

567
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:51,570
acetylation genes and increased memory

568
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:55,090
neuroplasticity and decreased depression

569
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:55,990
so holy basil is is the bomb this is one

570
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,520
that everybody should be on it also

571
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,800
increases growth hormone locally in the

572
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:04,840
muscles so it helps you to preserve

573
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:07,750
muscle mass as you age so these are just

574
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:11,439
some studies that I want to mention on

575
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:13,090
different areas about how what we do in

576
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,150
the environment actually affects

577
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:19,990
expression of our genes so stress

578
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:22,420
hormone the hormone itself what we're

579
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:23,980
talking about here is cortisol it can

580
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,990
alter gene expression lead to depression

581
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,980
and other mood disorders just from

582
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:31,570
exposing cells to the cortisol

583
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:35,950
cumulative lifetime stress and can

584
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:38,830
accelerate epigenetic aging as well so

585
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:40,780
we know we knew stress caused us to age

586
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,429
but we don't know how and what we're

587
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:44,830
finding now is it's actually changing

588
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:46,560
the expression of our genes these are

589
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:49,510
things that we have control over

590
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,399
it's that stress response it's not that

591
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:53,620
we feel stress

592
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,910
it's that expression of the cortisol

593
00:26:53,620 --> 00:27:01,090
when that cortisol gets out there we do

594
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:03,160
psychophysiological practice and we'll

595
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,360
have people come in and they'll say no

596
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,430
I'm not stressed we'll run them through

597
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,070
a stressor and they'll have all this

598
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:11,620
tension up here in the trapezius after a

599
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,850
stressor and this is after we remove the

600
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,590
stressor it persists

601
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:17,830
well they don't perceive that they're

602
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:19,480
stressed but their brain does their

603
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:21,939
brain is getting this feedback from the

604
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,550
tension in this muscle in causing

605
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,530
secretion of this cortisol so we're not

606
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:28,030
the best at perception of what's going

607
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,230
on in our bodies I want to show you

608
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:34,180
another study later that's really

609
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:36,790
impressive sleep one night of sleep

610
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:39,490
deprivation can alter the expression of

611
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:42,460
our clock genes I mean these are really

612
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:44,830
really important genes these are major

613
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:47,620
regulators in our body and we do not

614
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,030
want to mess with this one night of

615
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,290
sleep deprivation changes that

616
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:54,280
expression we don't know how long it

617
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:55,570
takes to reset that process twice asleep

618
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,950
is the first thing we address with our

619
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,800
clients it's what I spoke about last

620
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:02,470
year is sleep and you can find the talk

621
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:06,220
online if you go to youtube appear on

622
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:12,070
center you can find that talk on sleep

623
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:14,020
but really my my wife is a colonel in

624
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,510
the Air Force she works with human

625
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:20,620
performance there and the studies that

626
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:22,660
they did on sleep scary two to three

627
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,030
hours of sleep deprivation you have the

628
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:28,630
same vigilance level of somebody who or

629
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:32,770
four hours of sleep deprivation is

630
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:35,890
equivalent to two to three beers you

631
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:37,300
function at that vigilance level so if

632
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:40,390
you're an eight hour sleeper now that

633
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,919
was two hours for that one it was four

634
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:45,730
hours that they functioned legally

635
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:48,670
intoxicated 0.095 from a vigilance

636
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,890
standpoint that's scary stuff although

637
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:54,100
brain doesn't perceive it brain says oh

638
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:58,900
I'm fine but if you do testing their

639
00:28:54,100 --> 00:29:00,280
vigilance level goes down this was an

640
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,110
interesting study on vitamin D now

641
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,000
vitamin D is one of our our big

642
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,290
supplementation's because almost

643
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,410
everybody is deficient in vitamin D

644
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:11,680
vitamin D is a hormone hormones are

645
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:13,690
potent epigenetic modifiers at least a

646
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:17,110
hundred and sixty different processes in

647
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:18,730
the body are linked to this so you want

648
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:22,629
to make sure you keep your vitamin D

649
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:24,940
levels healthy hormones don't go without

650
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:28,420
youthful levels of hormones throughout

651
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:29,680
your life they change genes dramatically

652
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:32,500
estrogens one of the most potent

653
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:34,180
epigenetic modifiers that we know of so

654
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:37,300
you want to maintain healthy hormone

655
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:40,330
levels as we age aging is a disease it

656
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:43,409
is not a process that is and it's I

657
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:45,490
guess it is natural but it's not healthy

658
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:48,760
we don't want to age we're gonna do

659
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:50,410
everything we can to avoid that and a

660
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,790
lot of this is keeping some of these

661
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:56,680
things that here's what happens the body

662
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:59,980
we're programmed we've got programs in

663
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:03,130
our DNA that will tell processes in our

664
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:06,700
body and don't work as well anymore slow

665
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:10,030
down this this repair process don't

666
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:13,030
monitor that as well anymore that's how

667
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:14,860
we age and die because we're programmed

668
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:17,500
to do that once we find those programs

669
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:24,159
and turn them off we're gonna have some

670
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:29,920
pretty amazing stuff happen this is

671
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:34,840
about the omega-3s again and the Omega

672
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:37,450
threes have a profound effect on on

673
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,060
expressions of genes we can actually

674
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:42,580
change risk cardiovascular risk that's

675
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:45,970
why you know the the Mediterranean diet

676
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,649
is so effective the Mediterranean diet

677
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:49,600
is effective because of the Nutri

678
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:52,090
genomic capacity of the Mediterranean

679
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,790
diet hi olive oil intake hi seafood

680
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:57,810
intake works really well with modifying

681
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:59,860
genes and I can tell you in the 1500

682
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:04,750
people that I have reviewed their

683
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:07,270
genomics everybody starts off at a base

684
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,980
of a Mediterranean diet and I'm not

685
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:11,440
talking about the American Mediterranean

686
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:14,440
diet where it's heavy on grains the

687
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,930
traditional Italian Mediterranean diet

688
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,200
is heavy

689
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:22,890
on fish olive oil and vegetables and a

690
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,530
little bit of whole grains I used to be

691
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:28,800
paleo dot-com that was me I was a big

692
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:30,899
paleo guy and genomics kind of shifted

693
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,169
my view of this because I did see in the

694
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,700
genes of people that Mediterranean is

695
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:37,320
the core of what would build from but

696
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,880
then we can individualize that and say

697
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,530
okay well you're okay taking saturated

698
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,990
fat you got to lower your

699
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:44,850
polyunsaturated fat percentage intake so

700
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:47,370
we can modify things based on the

701
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:48,780
genomics but if you eat a Mediterranean

702
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:53,699
diet you're good

703
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:59,820
just focus on that this is interesting

704
00:31:53,700 --> 00:32:03,120
meditation 2209 genes were differently

705
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:06,389
expressed even in the short term

706
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:09,570
meditators eight weeks 1,500 genes were

707
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:12,320
expressed differently 874 were

708
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:17,100
upregulated 687 were down regulated I

709
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:18,480
mean this is impressive our mind

710
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,770
actually can't change our gene

711
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:26,460
expression that relaxation response

712
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:29,129
works really well we people used to say

713
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:33,000
that that was was tough but we knew it

714
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:36,270
weren't like placebo we know placebos

715
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,840
work if you believe something is gonna

716
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:41,309
work for you it actually does even if I

717
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,230
gave you a medication so you came in for

718
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:45,960
high blood pressure and I said you know

719
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:47,760
what this is this is a sugar pill but

720
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,640
it's gonna lower your blood pressure if

721
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:53,129
you trust me it will actually lower your

722
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,330
blood pressure if I say here's a

723
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:56,490
medication that will lower your blood

724
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:58,139
pressure and it's actually shown in

725
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:00,480
studies to lower your blood pressure and

726
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:04,350
you don't believe me and you don't trust

727
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:08,400
me it won't work very well that's the

728
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:11,850
mind changing the expression of genes it

729
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:16,230
actually works that way how about this

730
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:17,610
this is exercise exercise six months of

731
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:20,460
exercise and this is like two to three

732
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:24,270
days a week of moderately intense

733
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:27,990
exercise changes the expression of 7,000

734
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:29,310
genes in a positive way that's a third

735
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:32,480
of our genome

736
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:36,800
so you meditate an exercise you got it

737
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:39,240
almost half the genome taken care of I

738
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,610
mean these are genes these are really

739
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:46,230
important genes that are modified here P

740
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:48,899
part gamma people are G c1 a PDK for amp

741
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:50,430
k imp K is the longevity gene that's

742
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:53,610
what they're trying to target with

743
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:57,080
resveratrol and all we have to do is

744
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:57,080
exercise we want to take anything

745
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:03,629
berberine works really well to up

746
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:05,300
regulate that to glute for I mean these

747
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:09,510
are amazing genes that we're changing

748
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:11,639
with just exercising now this one's

749
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:15,390
gonna blow people away I just did a

750
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:17,100
podcast interview with Stephen Cole he

751
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:19,980
did a study with Barbara Fredrickson

752
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:23,489
where they looked at hedonic happiness

753
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:25,500
versus eudaimonic happiness everybody

754
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:27,928
agrees happiness is a good thing right

755
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,480
just be happy and you're gonna do well

756
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:34,260
right that's a healthy thing to do well

757
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,949
guess what if it's hedonic happiness you

758
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:39,780
actually don't benefit and what do we

759
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:42,899
mean by hedonic versus eudaimonic

760
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:45,210
well hedonic is just saying I'm gonna do

761
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:49,710
whatever it it is that makes me happy

762
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:51,659
and eudaimonic is basically living life

763
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:56,760
with a purpose how many of you in here

764
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:59,220
have a purpose about 1/3 of you that's

765
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,110
pretty good only about 20% of my

766
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:05,220
patients actually can identify a purpose

767
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:08,250
in life you need a purpose purpose gives

768
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:10,649
life meaning that meaning is eudaimonic

769
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:13,500
happiness and you know what when they

770
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:15,630
looked at immunological markers the

771
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,880
people with eudaimonic happiness had

772
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:20,010
huge boost in their immune system and

773
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,320
the people with hedonic happiness

774
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:25,110
actually went down and yet on

775
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:29,790
psychological tests they all tested very

776
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:31,620
high for happiness and well-being so you

777
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:37,980
know what our brain is not a good judge

778
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:39,660
of our body's response to things dr.

779
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,330
Cole is actually working on a device

780
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:44,549
that we can use that will self assess

781
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:46,830
in a very short kind of a home

782
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:49,800
assessment to see what we're doing is

783
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:52,200
actually benefiting us from a biological

784
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:58,440
standpoint as opposed to thinking that

785
00:35:52,200 --> 00:36:00,240
it's benefiting us so what can you do so

786
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,860
just remember that every cell in your

787
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:07,080
body is carrying the exact same code and

788
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:09,330
that code can be changed there is this

789
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,970
constant assessment of the environment

790
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:14,370
and the cells change their expression

791
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:16,980
based on what they're seeing in the

792
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:18,720
outside just as you would do if you walk

793
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,490
outside as cold and you said oh I'm

794
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,790
gonna put a jacket on and you walk out

795
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:26,669
with a jacket that's how every cell in

796
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:29,580
our body is actually responding and so

797
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:36,450
you can look at this genome these 23,000

798
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:38,430
genes yet these these areas here there's

799
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:39,509
all kinds of different interactions that

800
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,859
are occurring so you can look at the

801
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:43,200
base genome but you don't know what's

802
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:46,590
going on here when you go from 23,000 up

803
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:49,680
to over a million proteins all of this

804
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:52,530
is our lifestyle that changes to get us

805
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:56,779
to that end point of the protein which

806
00:36:52,530 --> 00:37:00,080
is really what makes our life what it is

807
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:01,640
so you can go get your genetic data

808
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,500
23andme

809
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:08,549
you don't need the 199 test you can get

810
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:11,160
the $99 test and if you use the 23andme

811
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:14,490
comm /dr stickler they'll actually give

812
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:16,290
you 10% off at checkout I don't have any

813
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:17,640
financial interest in 23andme and I

814
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,740
don't get any kickback from this one

815
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:23,029
just something they give physicians to

816
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:25,410
get their clients on board

817
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:28,860
you can go there and you can get the

818
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:30,240
900,000 genetic snips and you can go and

819
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,980
you can research these there's places

820
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,819
you can go online you can explore the

821
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:37,290
raw data you can go to snippy Viacom

822
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:39,660
look up things you can go to Liv willow

823
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:43,310
genetic genie from me thea is these are

824
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:45,990
all wonderful places to go to get data I

825
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:49,580
have to tell you avoid the

826
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:52,919
direct-to-consumer genetic reports

827
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:56,009
because as you probably figured out from

828
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:58,230
this talk so far today that code is

829
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:01,740
your destiny and that code is not a good

830
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:03,980
predictor of where you are yeah you may

831
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:08,939
carry the FTO

832
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:11,910
RS 99 three 96.9 but you know it could

833
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:14,190
be like a habitus like me well I had

834
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,569
that in AI should be morbidly obese and

835
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:18,180
all this and that's what the report

836
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:19,350
would tell me but these reports go

837
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,730
further and they tell you what kind of

838
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:22,799
diet to eat they tell you what type of

839
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:27,300
exercise you should do and it's not

840
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:30,750
accurate you can't use that to rely on

841
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:33,300
that report you have to be able to

842
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:35,310
interact with someone who understands

843
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,260
what it is and the best option is to

844
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:39,540
find a clinician or a coach that

845
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:41,970
understands genomics that can interpret

846
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:44,370
with you by understanding what your

847
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:45,990
lifestyle is understanding the

848
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:47,480
expressions that you have and understand

849
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,890
the goals that you have in mind

850
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,330
you know there's a difference in telling

851
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:53,839
someone what to eat if their goal is to

852
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:57,590
lose weight versus somebody who wants to

853
00:38:53,840 --> 00:39:00,630
optimize longevity based on the genetics

854
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:02,730
so your your eating patterns are not

855
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,800
predicted just by the genomics alone but

856
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:10,590
by the goals and the expressions of

857
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:14,880
those genes I've seen people that I had

858
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:19,310
a 78 year-old that was a mean fit guy I

859
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:22,260
mean very muscular fit

860
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:23,490
he's actually one of one of my doctor

861
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,290
stocker life I don't know if you guys

862
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:27,060
have seen him he's the guy in the

863
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:31,110
billboard with the Ohio State linebacker

864
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:34,560
body in the 70 year old face he actually

865
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:37,500
looks like that but he's he's one of our

866
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,970
doctors that appear on center he he had

867
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,740
me read his genetics he told me his okay

868
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:43,140
to talk about it but he was kind of

869
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:46,470
average from a exercise and fitness

870
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:48,660
standpoint I mean and you looked at him

871
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:51,419
when he was 57 years old and he looked

872
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:55,250
like his genetics but what he did from

873
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:58,560
the time he was 57 until now he's 78

874
00:39:55,250 --> 00:40:02,880
huge difference I mean the guy is his

875
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:05,820
fit he was pre-diabetic he was obese he

876
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,230
was had heart disease and all this stuff

877
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:10,660
that was going on with him at 57

878
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:13,960
and he made lifestyle changes with his

879
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:16,598
exercise did hormone replacement - so

880
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,640
exercise hormone replacement eating went

881
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:20,650
to a Mediterranean diet so all the

882
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,569
things he did without knowing his

883
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,859
genetics he just did the things that he

884
00:40:22,569 --> 00:40:25,900
naturally thought would work and they

885
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:27,578
worked right for him and as it turned

886
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:30,160
out he followed exactly what he should

887
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:32,829
have with his exercise with his diet

888
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,828
with his supplementation patterns so it

889
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:38,020
created an epigenetic response that he

890
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:43,630
wasn't programmed to have based on his

891
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:44,980
genomic code alright so I want to leave

892
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:47,819
some time for some questions I'm not

893
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:51,010
sure how much time we have right now but

894
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:53,849
you guys have someone be glad to to

895
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,849
field them for you

896
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,069
others there's a hundred companies out

897
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,910
there that you submit that sometimes

898
00:41:05,069 --> 00:41:10,920
they'll take your your 23andme data and

899
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:12,750
they'll provide your report sometimes

900
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,089
they'll ask you for saliva samples and

901
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:16,859
they'll provide you with a report if

902
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:19,349
they're not providing you counseling

903
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:22,230
with that report wouldn't advise doing

904
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:23,910
it because this reports are basically

905
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,740
useless unless you really are a

906
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:27,808
biohacker and you understand that

907
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:29,220
in-depth aspects of what each of those

908
00:41:27,809 --> 00:41:31,770
genes that they're looking at you know

909
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:34,140
what does peep rgc 1a actually code for

910
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:37,380
and why does this variant mean this to

911
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:39,000
me if you don't have somebody that can

912
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,180
coach you through that and give you the

913
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,680
details as to why that's happening and

914
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:46,589
relate it to you from a lifestyle

915
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:50,308
standpoint it's it's pretty much useless

916
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:55,380
I interviewed the guy who who led the

917
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:59,190
the European genomic-based weight loss

918
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:02,609
study and he's a researcher out of Spain

919
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:04,619
Nicola cross - and they found that when

920
00:42:02,609 --> 00:42:06,270
people followed a genomic based diet so

921
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:08,250
a diet based on their own genes they had

922
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,109
33% greater weight loss over two year

923
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:13,020
period

924
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:14,609
but even him as a researcher he said you

925
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,650
know you can't just take somebody whose

926
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:17,940
genes and say oh this is the diet you

927
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:20,430
should be on doesn't work that way

928
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:21,779
you've got to interact with that person

929
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:23,669
you know I've got people that you know

930
00:42:21,779 --> 00:42:27,059
we look at them and we look at an MCN

931
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:30,210
six and it says that they should be

932
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:31,859
gluten or lactose intolerant they know

933
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:33,930
lactose intolerance it's a probability

934
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:38,549
but if it came from a directed consumer

935
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:40,230
report or like Prometheus my wife got

936
00:42:38,549 --> 00:42:43,049
her Prometheus back and she's got high

937
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:47,220
risk for prostate cancer and and male

938
00:42:43,049 --> 00:42:49,109
pattern baldness okay I mean Prometheus

939
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:52,230
will scare you to death when you get the

940
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:54,150
report back so really you want to focus

941
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:56,010
on the stuff that you actually have

942
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:58,170
controls over the stuff that you can

943
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:59,549
actually have an impact and that's why

944
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,619
you want somebody who really understands

945
00:42:59,549 --> 00:43:03,000
lifestyle genetics they can give you

946
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:06,260
that direction and there there's several

947
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,260
companies out there they're doing that

948
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:19,790
oh yeah telomeres have been I mean

949
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,560
they've been popular for about the last

950
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:23,210
ten years I've been measuring my

951
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:27,049
telomeres regularly

952
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:29,720
the problem is telomere testing is it's

953
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:31,430
not the most accurate and and I use life

954
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,859
length out of Spain which is really the

955
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:35,750
the premier organization it's like 800

956
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,350
bucks to get your telomeres each each

957
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,170
year though

958
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:42,770
but even testing yearly is almost too

959
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:46,160
frequently with it and you see a lot of

960
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:52,100
variation in it there's there's better

961
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:53,750
ways to assess that and soon we won't

962
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:57,049
have to worry about was perish already

963
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:59,870
extended her telomeres by inserting a

964
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:01,580
gene liz is a is the CEO of a company

965
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:03,770
called by Aviva and I interviewed her

966
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:06,529
about a year and a half ago right after

967
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:09,830
she infected her genome with a telomere

968
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:12,230
telomerase gene and she reversed a short

969
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:14,630
telomeres 20 years so she got really

970
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:18,010
good results from it can't wait to get

971
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:18,010
myself enrolled in that one

972
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:32,460
well you you mentioned two things that

973
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,760
can potentially not really work together

974
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:37,760
like autism and depression autism a lot

975
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,190
of the times you'll find true genetic

976
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,930
mutations so not just a minor variation

977
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:46,080
in the in the genome you just actually

978
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:47,549
see some gene that's truncated or one

979
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,690
that's extended or something like that

980
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:53,100
it really depends on the cause and

981
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:57,840
there's a lot of different there's a lot

982
00:44:53,100 --> 00:45:00,360
of differences in the in the take go to

983
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:05,300
go to the Ironman executive podcast and

984
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:08,400
listen to an interview I did with hmm

985
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:12,750
yeah Jill uh sure

986
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:14,700
she runs Autism Society out of San

987
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:16,350
Francisco brilliant woman she's a lawyer

988
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,210
but man I couldn't believe the

989
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:21,560
transgenerational epigenetics that she

990
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:23,730
was able to talk about with autism and

991
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:26,520
she's of the belief that once it's there

992
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:27,810
it's kind of stuck I'm not you know I

993
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,540
think there's ways we can do it but I

994
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:32,279
think that there's a lot of a lot of

995
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:34,920
over hype on it on the internet about

996
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,720
all these interactions of all these

997
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,400
genes and how you can do this and you

998
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:42,419
end up micromanaging all this stuff that

999
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:44,760
really doesn't have a great outcome so

1000
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:47,250
you know from that standpoint I don't

1001
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,680
have a good answer from the standpoint

1002
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:52,770
of depression yes there's definitely

1003
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:55,020
things you can look at killer BDNF BDNF

1004
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:57,150
alone raising levels of BDNF expression

1005
00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:00,450
will actually suppress genes that

1006
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:02,370
promote depression you can look at

1007
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:06,109
neurotransmitter genomics and see if

1008
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:08,069
you're prone to low reward dopamine

1009
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:10,350
genomics or your balance of

1010
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:11,760
norepinephrine and dopamine are off so

1011
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,470
there's there's a lot of them that you

1012
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,420
can look at from that standpoint as

1013
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:17,189
opposed to just looking at it and saying

1014
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,840
oh these genes tell me you do better on

1015
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:21,480
this antidepressant than this one that

1016
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:24,510
that's precision medicine I do precision

1017
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:27,200
wellness so I focus on lifestyle

1018
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:30,680
components rather than medication per se

1019
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,680
did you have a question

1020
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:36,070
yeah it was just something he mentioned

1021
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,140
in the podcast that he's wanting to

1022
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:40,450
create I think he's in the process of

1023
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:45,450
creating it but it's gonna be testing

1024
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:48,339
things like like t-cell CD 95 CD 28

1025
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:50,109
which is what UCLA's pathology lab tests

1026
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:52,090
now for an immune function I get that I

1027
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:54,730
test myself on that because it's better

1028
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:55,630
marker than telomeres to determine

1029
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:57,610
whether you're doing something that's

1030
00:46:55,630 --> 00:47:00,120
making a benefit or not in a very short

1031
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:00,120
period of time

1032
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:19,460
now 25 years we're gonna be immortal I

1033
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:21,740
you know I George church the head he's

1034
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:24,890
one of the top geneticists at Harvard he

1035
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:28,310
is like the guru of aging and reverse

1036
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:28,910
aging and everything he's ever predicted

1037
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:32,690
has come true

1038
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:35,980
and a year ago December he said within

1039
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:39,830
five years we are going to have a major

1040
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:42,680
treatment for aging I mean the

1041
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:44,750
accelerated expansion of what we're

1042
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,940
creating right now and with this CRISPR

1043
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:49,460
technology it was only discovered in

1044
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:52,370
2012 this gene editing technology and

1045
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:54,110
we're in human trials we have human

1046
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:56,480
trials in China and we have human trials

1047
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:58,250
in the United States right now I mean

1048
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:01,130
they are curing cancers with this stuff

1049
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:03,940
I mean they're reprogramming the white

1050
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:06,110
cells to go right after the cancers

1051
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:10,130
there's I mean there's people doing

1052
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:12,800
thymic rejuvenation dr. Fahy i mean this

1053
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:14,120
stuff is amazing I mean it's an exciting

1054
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,060
time to be alive because I think what

1055
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:20,359
we're gonna start seeing is these these

1056
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:23,720
impacts that will have that will create

1057
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:25,430
steps in reverse aging so you know in in

1058
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,890
10 years we may be able to reverse age

1059
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:30,350
five years and then in another five

1060
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:31,910
years we can step back ten years and the

1061
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:35,360
net result is we're gonna gradually

1062
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:36,740
creep back until where of these 25-year

1063
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:39,680
old bodies it's just a matter of trying

1064
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:42,830
to find how it happens but it's genetic

1065
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,750
code we we have a code we just have to

1066
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:47,450
learn how to read that code and then

1067
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:49,430
we've got these tools to modify it but

1068
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:51,950
we don't know enough about it yet that's

1069
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:53,660
that's what's cool we're already one

1070
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:56,870
step ahead but we've got to step back

1071
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:59,240
and say okay well let's understand how

1072
00:48:56,870 --> 00:49:01,220
this works before we start using the

1073
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:03,529
tools that we've been provided it's like

1074
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:05,870
getting a hammer and not having invented

1075
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:08,960
the nail yet okay well what I use this

1076
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:11,799
for but now we're stepping back and

1077
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,800
actually looking at it

1078
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:27,780
is it possible to reverse aging it's

1079
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:31,730
possible is it oh yeah if something if

1080
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:34,500
there isn't if there is something in the

1081
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:37,440
in life that we're aware of that can do

1082
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:42,000
it we can do it yeah it's the same code

1083
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:43,770
we possess the exact same code as they

1084
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,500
call it the immortal jellyfish the

1085
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:49,830
immortal jellyfish reverse ages you know

1086
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:53,700
and sharks turtles I mean some of them

1087
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:58,350
have zero aging at all they possess the

1088
00:49:53,700 --> 00:50:01,259
same four letters that we do so if we

1089
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:03,810
can see that example in nature in in

1090
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:11,330
this biosphere we have the potential to

1091
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:11,330
replicate it George church

1092
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:22,710
I'm not one to say I'm not I have I have

1093
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:27,329
a kind of a contract with one of them

1094
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:29,249
and I'm in an NDA with them but it's

1095
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:30,839
gonna it's supposed to come out first

1096
00:50:29,249 --> 00:50:33,598
quarter of this year but it's probably

1097
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:36,690
the second quarter but within two years

1098
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,670
it'll be under $200 Illumina just came

1099
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:41,819
out with a new they're introducing their

1100
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:45,180
new machine which is like I mean it's

1101
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:47,400
the Maserati of sequencers and it's

1102
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:50,669
gonna we're gonna be under $200 within

1103
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:53,029
two years for full genome all right one

1104
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:53,029
more question

1105
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:08,850
not organizations but athletes yes

1106
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:10,560
you know I practice an area of medicine

1107
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:12,930
that's about optimizing performance

1108
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:15,810
period and it doesn't matter if you're a

1109
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:19,160
CEO whether you're a stay-at-home mom

1110
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:22,230
whether you're a professional athlete

1111
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:26,609
there's ways that we can enhance you

1112
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:31,410
know the way I see it is we all life on

1113
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:34,650
earth either evolves or dies and we are

1114
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:37,200
a very fragile organism were the only

1115
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:39,500
hominoid species on this earth it's like

1116
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:42,509
every bird on earth being a cardinal

1117
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:46,310
okay think about that that's where we

1118
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:49,590
are right now and we are very vulnerable

1119
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:51,240
and so you know what is the next stage

1120
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:53,040
of evolution and I think the next stage

1121
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:57,689
of evolution is the merging of

1122
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:59,279
technology with human physiology it's

1123
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:01,290
inevitable we're gonna have to get there

1124
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,720
at some point if we're going to survive

1125
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:04,200
as a species and I think it's pretty

1126
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,609
awesome

1127
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,100
you know people freaked out over the

1128
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:09,620
Borg you know they always make these

1129
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:13,770
merging 'he's like these evil things

1130
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:15,720
they really do and you know it's funny

1131
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:18,750
because the the the Borg was a hive

1132
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:21,629
mentality you know it was a collective

1133
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:24,300
consciousness and what we all talk about

1134
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:26,520
in in like yoga and stuff talk about the

1135
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,900
collective consciousness you know and

1136
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,540
yet it was like this evil thing when it

1137
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:32,190
was the Borg like like it all of a

1138
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:37,050
sudden becomes evil whenever it becomes

1139
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:39,420
a machine part of it but it's really you

1140
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:42,390
know I think I think we're gonna see

1141
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:43,680
some some huge advances over the next

1142

1148
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,600
