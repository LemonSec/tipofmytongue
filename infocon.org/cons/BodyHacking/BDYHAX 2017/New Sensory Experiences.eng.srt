1
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,369
yeah sure so everyone I'm Scott Novick

2
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:18,830
I'm the co-founder and chief technology

3
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,830
of a company called neo sensory we

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:24,349
develop wearable devices in this case

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,299
vest that's designed for taking

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,800
arbitrary streams of information and

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,890
mapping them to your sense of touch

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,900
using vibration on your torso we have a

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,670
demo over in the exhibitor area I

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,519
encourage you all to check it out right

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,920
now we focus mainly on sound and mapping

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,570
that to our sense of touch and we're

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,040
trying to capture and convey enough

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,620
information through our sense of touch

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,800
for people who have no sense of hearing

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,980
to be able to understand speech through

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,720
this and so this is a spinoff from my

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,870
PhD work that I did with this

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:59,390
neuroscientist dr. David Eagleman and a

20
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,269
lot of it is inspired by the brain port

21
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:05,089
and the research of paul bach-y-rita

22
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:09,530
over at why cab or the late bucky paul

23
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:13,670
bach-y-rita and i would say the most the

24
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:16,310
most mind-blowing thing i've seen would

25
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:19,250
have to be just the first time we got

26
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:22,010
like a really good working prototype of

27
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:24,200
our tech and let a person with no sense

28
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,940
of hearing try it on and we train them

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,430
up on just learning how to even just

30
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,259
identify some words so could say a word

31
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,630
without them reading my lips and they're

32
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:38,330
able to identify the word was like that

33
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:40,820
was a pretty special experience clinical

34
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,560
research director at recap and we cab is

35
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,440
the company that manufactures the brain

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,250
part v100 device we are an fda-approved

37
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,020
device

38
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,680
we're considered a medical device so we

39
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,570
had to go through FDA approval process I

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,300
have been working with the brain port

41
00:01:53,570 --> 00:02:00,110
for several years now I started off with

42
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:02,360
the FDA clinical trial so one of the

43
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,220
most profound things I've learned while

44
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,310
working with this device is that the

45
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,679
idea that vision is occurs in the brain

46
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,290
that we see with our brain that was an

47
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,000
idea that I've heard but after seeing

48
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,760
people being able to perform visual

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,769
tests with stimulation in their and

50
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,140
their tongue has really taught me that

51
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:23,510
it actually occurs in the brain that the

52
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:28,390
eyes are just one input and there are

53
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:30,120
other modalities that can be used mark

54
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,079
my name is Mark

55
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,209
I feel like I'm kind of the black sheep

56
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,750
of this panel here all these people are

57
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:39,150
very accomplished I am a PhD candidate

58
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,230
specializing in cross-cultural senses

59
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,700
the different ways that very societies

60
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,780
use their senses to make sense of the

61
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,670
world in different ways

62
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,640
but in addition to that I'm also a

63
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,048
grinder and as opposed to the people

64
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,429
here who are enhancing your senses I

65
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:55,440
guess I'm more interested in confusing

66
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,230
senses so a couple things I've worked on

67
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,180
are subdural armor and I'm currently

68
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,819
making a device that allows you to set

69
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,599
your level of sobriety with respect to

70
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:09,119
alcohol and so an interesting thing is

71
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,910
when I had some time on my arm which

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,000
I've now taken out a consistent about

73
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:17,069
non-newtonian fluid and so what that

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,920
means is when you're just taking it easy

75
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,560
it's very pliable and being valuable but

76
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,819
when you hit it hard it gets really hard

77
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,319
so when we were testing it out if you

78
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,179
were tentative about hitting that tool

79
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,500
box on the corner it would actually hurt

80
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,780
quite a bit you had to go full force

81
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,310
into it I thought it was interesting how

82
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:37,410
that changed how you had to interact

83
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:39,540
with your environment Olivia you told us

84
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,190
about north defense a little bit and you

85
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,950
said you were one of the first or second

86
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:46,639
person who had it off first and this if

87
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:50,160
we put it together at the same time okay

88
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:53,040
one of the first two so if you don't

89
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,780
know it's it's implanted pierced on the

90
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,519
front of his chest right here how much

91
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,129
time does it take to really engage with

92
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,919
the new sensor how long does it take to

93
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:04,768
become part of your reality it's it's a

94
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,379
very interesting point because we knew

95
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,940
from a lot that we learned from actually

96
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:12,298
from these guys it's interesting it's

97
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:14,099
reading from home and we do that you

98
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,989
know things the things that have to do

99
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,539
with brain chain with mind change take a

100
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:21,120
lot of time so we didn't expect anything

101
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:23,940
to happen in the first moment but then

102
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,070
we realized it did because the first day

103
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,130
that we put the knots and so on was the

104
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,349
day before we did they're kind of a

105
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,870
lounge and official lounge and it was in

106
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:35,880
Scotts living room the other guy that

107
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,599
has one of my partners it has the node

108
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:42,289
sense and the moment that we put it on

109
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:44,569
since that moment onwards I remember

110
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:47,149
been in his living room many times but I

111
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:50,659
will never forget now how the room is

112
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:53,599
orientated with you know with the earth

113
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:55,879
so it's something that actually started

114
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:59,688
working immediately so from that moment

115
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:03,110
onwards I remember every place by how

116
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:05,300
its orientated with with earth and from

117
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,749
then onwards as I said now I start

118
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:11,240
understanding and discovering new layers

119
00:05:08,749 --> 00:05:14,029
of the of the impact that the sentence

120
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,270
has on me so it's it's pretty much

121
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:20,029
immediately and it's in every day new

122
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,580
something that's happening with that and

123
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:25,849
without said I know that it's an endless

124
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,859
basically ongoing process so I'm not

125
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:29,779
expecting in a month or two or three to

126
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,629
get to the place where I said okay I'm

127
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:35,180
done with it because we continue

128
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:37,249
learning how to use our years you know

129
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,770
and our eyes throughout all our lives

130
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:43,969
it's not in it's not an endless it's not

131
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:45,438
an end point process I hardly know where

132
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,209
North is in my own house so it would be

133
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,389
great to be able Minh just intuitively

134
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:52,459
know Scott you're talking about the vest

135
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:54,379
and the same thing how long does it take

136
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:55,849
for somebody to come on and learn

137
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:56,569
something that's complicated like

138
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:59,330
hearing that

139
00:05:56,569 --> 00:06:00,800
takes us a while to bring on yeah so so

140
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,789
this is this is pretty interesting so

141
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,999
this this thing we're actually still

142
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:08,808
trying to figure out what is the case

143
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:10,819
sort of going back to I'm sorry

144
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:12,860
thank you yes sorry leave you leave you

145
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:15,979
okay I don't I wasn't I'm sorry if I

146
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,509
pronounced leave you there is certain

147
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:19,639
information that you can get and you

148
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:21,889
immediately can start to kind of

149
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,769
understand its meaning so for example

150
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:28,009
with the vest it has the property that

151
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:30,469
louder sounds on average vibrate more on

152
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:33,139
the torso so what that means is you know

153
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:35,839
if a car is driving by you you can feel

154
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:37,819
the vibration like growing more and more

155
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,069
intense as the cars going past you and

156
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:42,830
as it goes away but there's a lot more

157
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:45,289
information embedded in that signal and

158
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,419
I think what we're starting to find is

159
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:50,300
so so first of all taking a step back

160
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:52,279
and looking at some of the

161
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,560
neuroplasticity and training literature

162
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,440
there are all sorts of these interesting

163
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,840
experiments

164
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,250
so for example you have these prism

165
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,020
goggles experiments where you put on

166
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,150
this curve goggles on a person and it

167
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,590
like flips their world upside down or

168
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,479
flips left versus right and there all

169
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,950
these poor these darlings like poor

170
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,270
postdocs and grad students for their

171
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:13,229
professors make them wear these goggles

172
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,669
for weeks at a time and what you find

173
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,490
with these studies is that it's usually

174
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:19,860
on the order and these are adults on the

175
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,690
order of like three or four weeks for

176
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,180
their brain to kind of naturally flip

177
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,770
that representation around and it's not

178
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,930
just prison goggles studies there's also

179
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:29,880
study for like fake ears on people and

180
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,500
have them like try and like locate where

181
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,730
sounds are coming from against three to

182
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,030
four weeks there are studies there's

183
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:37,320
this famous neuroplasticity researcher

184
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,609
MERS Nick I think I'm pronouncing his

185
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,520
name right where he does these monkey

186
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,840
studies where you sever the nerves of

187
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,700
the monkey and you like look at what

188
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,380
part of somatosensory cortex goes dark

189
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,659
and then you see in three or four weeks

190
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:51,510
it gets taken over by other regions of

191
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,090
somatosensory cortex so I think that's

192
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:57,240
that's sort of the the time component to

193
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:59,520
really kind of large-scale neuroplastic

194
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,620
changes in the brain and that's under

195
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,289
the condition of what I would call like

196
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,910
extreme reliability on that employee so

197
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,960
if you're used to getting vision and now

198
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,070
all of a sudden you're not getting

199
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,479
vision but you're getting a vision

200
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,340
remapped in a totally different way you

201
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,770
have this kind of you're now a hundred

202
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,289
percent relying on your expending a lot

203
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,430
of mental energy trying to train up on

204
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,780
this sorry this is like a really

205
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,720
long-winded answer and I like tend to

206
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,039
just get like I dive down I'm interested

207
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,400
in it and I'm gonna pretend like they

208
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,470
are too so the short answer is we don't

209
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,090
know yet we're in the middle of

210
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,770
iterating over our algorithms and what

211
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,990
that means is every time we make an

212
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:37,380
iteration it's sort of kind of like

213
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,210
resetting back to to kind of step zero

214
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,070
and then sending people out the door

215
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,210
again so it's kind of an iteration right

216
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,650
now we're pulling out like the two week

217
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,000
mark but not the three are you seeing

218
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,350
the same thing with brain port Patricia

219
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,140
is that three or four weeks is that

220
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,880
about no it's actually a lot okay that

221
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,160
was really surprising is how quickly

222
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,630
people can adapt and learn to interpret

223
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:59,100
these signals we have found ten hours is

224
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,720
sufficient for and we do break it up

225
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,640
over two to three days to give people

226
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,320
time to process what they've learned

227
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,810
come back you know it's questioning this

228
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,280
is without a constant interface of the

229
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,910
device that's right just like putting it

230
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,290
on for

231
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,300
that amount of time yeah so it's paying

232
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,610
on for two to three hours per day over a

233
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,020
period of three to four days and and

234
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,460
that's something that we tested when we

235
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,130
were doing the clinical trial for the

236
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:22,980
FDA is how how much training is

237
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,170
sufficient to you know and be able to

238
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,120
enhance your performance and ten hours

239
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:29,010
this and people can put it right back on

240
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,960
and jump right back in yeah so and we

241
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,730
equated to learning a new language if

242
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,620
you're learning how to do this even

243
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,540
you're able to take it home after ten

244
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,940
hours and use it safely and

245
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,160
independently but you want to practice

246
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,680
it too to learn more with that so you

247
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,850
that we encourage practicing just you

248
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,849
know treating it like a new language

249
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,560
sorry I didn't dive in for a second I

250
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,300
think it also depends on sort of what

251
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,680
you're trying the I think it also

252
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,000
depends on maybe the complexity of the

253
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,859
task and what you're trying to get out

254
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,750
of it and I think the three to four week

255
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,280
mark that up and I just to clarify the

256
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,310
three to four week mark is like when

257
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,920
your brain kind of has that on on this

258
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,089
short time period is kind of the minimum

259
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,219
amount of time I think it takes for your

260
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:13,320
brain to click and develop what you

261
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,000
would call maybe a wholly new perception

262
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,440
so I think it's definitely the case that

263
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,750
with a lot of these devices including

264
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,910
the best you can start to perform like

265
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:24,870
you can start to use this information

266
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:26,160
immediately whether it's identifying

267
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,370
that car going by you whether it's

268
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,380
perfect like performing these tasks like

269
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:35,160
spatial relationships and your training

270
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:38,010
paradigms or you know or getting people

271
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,360
to learn a mapping of a pattern of

272
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,840
vibration that they're feeling to a word

273
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,940
or north but I automate maybe you can

274
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,850
also speak to when you you immediately

275
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,230
know where North is but how long did was

276
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,440
there some do you feel like there was

277
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:54,720
some sort of time at which between is so

278
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,100
like this is what north sense it's the

279
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,410
difference between having a compass and

280
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,690
being fed the information and intuiting

281
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:03,329
the information yeah so maybe a very

282
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,520
important point to stand on is the

283
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:08,160
difference between a tool in a sense

284
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,620
right so a tool as you say a compass

285
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,360
because some people come to us and say

286
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,550
but I have a compass in my phone I can

287
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,070
buy a one dollar compass in in a shop

288
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:19,109
why do I need the north cents so a tool

289
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,950
is something that you did you you

290
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,930
consciously decide to use it

291
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,750
cific time because you need it or you

292
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:29,060
want to use it you used it you took the

293
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,560
compass out of your boat of your pocket

294
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,739
you used it you know where the knot is

295
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,900
you put it back and that's it a sense is

296
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:38,300
not something that asks you or you

297
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,329
decide if you want to sense that thing

298
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,449
or not we do not decide you know because

299
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:46,910
we are we are now on a planet and I'm

300
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:49,220
just speaking I did not leave my eyes at

301
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,170
home or I did not leave my sense of

302
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,300
touch at home because I'm not using it

303
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:56,150
now it's with me all the time my taste

304
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,849
is in my mouth and say my not sense is

305
00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:02,030
with me so that's that that's a very

306
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:05,660
important you know difference to make

307
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:07,970
and according to what just to add a a

308
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,939
moment to what what they were speaking

309
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,680
about one of the immediate experiences

310
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,750
that I live in London and one of the

311
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,630
immediate experiences that I had was on

312
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:20,210
the tube on the Underground when you go

313
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,860
on the Underground most of the time you

314
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:24,520
are sure that you're going straight

315
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:27,800
because you have no idea you're in this

316
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,300
metal tube that is going that is going

317
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,160
somewhere and you're assured that it's

318
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,079
always going straight unless the time

319
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,780
that you hear like really noises over

320
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,420
Harter but then with the north's

321
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,730
suddenly the day after I sit in the tube

322
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:43,849
and I feel I feel my new friend

323
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:46,760
vibrating and I'm like okay so now we

324
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:49,310
turned and I you also understand to

325
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,490
which direction you turned and you start

326
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:55,400
understanding all your journey into you

327
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:57,350
know so I'm not I'm not blind but but

328
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,600
it's it's kind of the same the same

329
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,610
experience because suddenly I did you

330
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,650
know my eyes could not help me in that

331
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,050
that specific moment but there was

332
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:08,600
something else that helped me understand

333
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:11,089
so mark you didn't mention earlier

334
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,710
you've got several magnet implants a lot

335
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:17,420
of people describe that as having a

336
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:19,370
sixth sense I mean we don't how long did

337
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,130
it take to intuit

338
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,990
those signals how obvious are those when

339
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:27,290
did it become a part of your boring

340
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:29,210
everyday intuitive experience I do not

341
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,530
find it boring at all to this day I try

342
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,819
to remember how long I had them actually

343
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:35,429
I think is least

344
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:36,509
year-and-a-half since my first one but

345
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:38,129
they actually feel differently as well

346
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:39,179
well I have three of them and then one

347
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,949
of them I don't feel at all it was an

348
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:42,539
experimental coating so we got to just

349
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:44,399
put it in the meat to see how it did I

350
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:47,129
have one that's an M 31 that's a small

351
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,799
disc and then I have a rod and so the

352
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:51,239
disc is quite good at feeling shapes of

353
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:52,649
things and the rod is kind of

354
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:53,910
directional so depending on the lines of

355
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:54,389
flux coming out of the electromagnetic

356
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,309
field

357
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:57,839
I can either not feel it at all or I can

358
00:13:56,309 --> 00:14:00,539
feel it actually quite a bit stronger

359
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,160
so what mark is talking about is if you

360
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,689
don't know people some people have

361
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,749
magnets implanted in their hands and

362
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:08,789
we're effectively using them too they

363
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:11,579
vibrate when you get near electrical

364
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:13,589
signals or electrical fields do you want

365
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:14,819
to explain more about this sure for the

366
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:17,850
most part it's just a really fun thing

367
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:20,519
because it adds a sense of discovery to

368
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,289
your environment there are certain

369
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,669
places in San Francisco you can kind of

370
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:25,679
feel when the trend is about to start

371
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:27,089
even though it hasn't started yet so

372
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,160
that does like if you if you want to

373
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:30,959
have like a slice super weak superpower

374
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,589
you can tell when it's gonna move so you

375
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,748
can adjust your your balance accordingly

376
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:38,369
sometimes people find very surprising

377
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:39,479
just sheets of electromagnetic fields

378
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:41,639
that they don't know why they're there

379
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:43,470
it happens in banks sometimes just the

380
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,850
middle of nowhere and I mean your guess

381
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,819
is as good as mine as why it's actually

382
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,470
there what's causing Patricia how many

383
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:51,748
senses is too many

384
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,600
can we overwhelm ourselves with too many

385
00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:59,699
inputs in this way you have information

386
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:02,609
in this area yeah I'm gonna say no right

387
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:04,469
now I think that kind of the cool idea

388
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:06,989
about these different technologies we're

389
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,659
talking about is that eventually we'll

390
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:12,059
want to pair them together to gain a

391
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:16,049
greater you know perception of the world

392
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:17,999
so right now we just have people using

393
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:21,029
the brain part with with a king which is

394
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:24,809
a very conventional type of device and

395
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:26,399
or with a dog guide and they're able to

396
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:28,259
function well like that so I think that

397
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,959
we can or or even if they're using an

398
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:33,209
app on their phone for that might like a

399
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,459
GPS type thing variable to use that

400
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:37,199
together so I think just you know a few

401
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:38,549
devices are being pulled together a few

402
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,829
senses are being pulled together but I

403
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:44,159
definitely think there's potential for

404
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:45,899
for adding more and combining it's a

405
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,889
it's a little it's a learning process

406
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:48,989
you know

407
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:51,359
so it's it's time the same like asking

408
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:53,129
someone how many things can you learn at

409
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:55,290
the same time there is a certain

410
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:58,079
capacity of things that you can deal

411
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:02,069
with to really get to a place where it

412
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,868
becomes effective so same probably with

413
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:07,049
you know with with new senses and

414
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:09,059
artificial senses you you have one you

415
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,679
get used to it to learn it it learns you

416
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:13,519
use you know you have a whole new

417
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:16,350
relationship with your new body part and

418
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,290
from then onwards you know you can add

419
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:21,689
to it and the thing that you will add

420
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:24,179
the next thing will not only add to the

421
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:26,699
basic human that you were born but it

422
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:28,529
will add to the basic rumor that you

423
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:31,799
were born plus the sense that you had

424
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:34,769
before so you know so if you if you

425
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:38,879
people come in and ask us so when is the

426
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:40,290
next thing stands coming out and one of

427
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,839
the things that we say that we don't

428
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:45,358
intend at this stage to spray the market

429
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:47,939
with senses because we will do more harm

430
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:50,279
as people will get you know confused

431
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:51,929
fronting so dates it's a it's a process

432
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:55,019
it's now you know it's that's not

433
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:56,699
picking gears but well what what is

434
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,779
first off to everybody what is coming up

435
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:59,849
in the next couple of years is there

436
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:01,679
anything that you're excited about that

437
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:05,880
is almost done that research is being

438
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:13,230
done in this space on here are 13

439
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:17,120
questions that there's a lot there's

440
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:19,439
there's a few things that we work on and

441
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:23,869
some of them we research and some of

442
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:27,299
them are in a more advanced place of but

443
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:30,330
because so we we are a company and we

444
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:33,120
are not in a research only place so

445
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:35,010
people bought this thing from us and

446
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,518
soon they are gonna get it and it's

447
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:40,919
gonna be a unique first time when

448
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:43,860
because you have a few amazing people in

449
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:46,380
the world like moon and Neil who are our

450
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:49,320
partners in inside book nests and one of

451
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,120
the part of the cofounders but Neil is

452
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,370
the only person who has that specific

453
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,678
sense and moon is the only person who

454
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,678
has her specific sense now you first

455
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,150
thing we're going to have a big bunch of

456
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,120
people having the same

457
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:05,370
so there is a whole research stage that

458
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,080
that is gonna happen and we're gonna

459
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,810
learn for me they're gonna learn from it

460
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,919
and then we move we move onwards

461
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,780
well it's something we've got a lot to

462
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,000
learn after everybody puts North cents

463
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,960
on their chest yeah I mean Scott I know

464
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,760
you come at this from an engineering

465
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,680
perspective like what what kind of

466
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,090
hurdles do we have to deal with design

467
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,260
devices when we're coming up with these

468
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,179
sorts of things because they are new

469
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,250
yeah I think there's a lot of kind of

470
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:29,010
fundamental questions that need to be

471
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,810
answered if you have a specific

472
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,580
application in mind so I know a lot of

473
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,990
people are developing I mean at the end

474
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,340
of the day what we're developing could

475
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,260
be considered a bit of a platform

476
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,270
there's gonna be an API developers can

477
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,400
jack in wherever they want I'm sure it's

478
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:44,250
the same thing before yeah is there an

479
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:51,450
API for the the north sense for people

480
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:53,160
to plug in other things okay but what

481
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:56,510
fun people fundamentally need to

482
00:18:53,160 --> 00:19:00,810
understand every step of the process

483
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:03,420
when trying to give themselves a new

484
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:06,210
sense so just by way of example in the

485
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:09,510
case of let's say sound for your sense

486
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:11,730
of touch it's not as simple as just say

487
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,980
okay let's just take this audio file and

488
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,170
like feed it to speaker and put it

489
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,700
against your skin if you want people to

490
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:20,040
be able to understand speech so you have

491
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,200
to understand you have to start out like

492
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,360
what's your source information okay it

493
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,980
sound what's the task that I want people

494
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,110
to be able to perform with this source

495
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,240
information well I want people don't

496
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,010
understand speech the second you say

497
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,660
that that immediately gives you a number

498
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:36,090
of constraints you have to work in you

499
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,550
immediately know how much of that sound

500
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:42,270
information need to capture and convey

501
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:44,490
to your senses and then going down then

502
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:46,770
on the other side you have your skin and

503
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:49,290
your skin has all sorts of these other

504
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,910
properties and constraints to it so your

505
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,409
skin has various different different

506
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,120
types of receptors and they all have

507
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,830
certain different constraints themselves

508
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,729
so you have different receptors that can

509
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:02,010
sense heat or pain or vibration which is

510
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,530
what we use and you have to understand

511
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:06,990
these receptors that convey that capture

512
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:08,850
of vibration information the receptors

513
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,650
themselves this is the big idea they

514
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,550
don't care what information they're

515
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,740
actually capped

516
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,419
conveying there's just design for

517
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,220
capturing a specific type of information

518
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:20,220
and your brain is what's figuring it out

519
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,320
but you have to make sure that the

520
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:25,110
receptors are capturing enough of that

521
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,360
information and then in between you have

522
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:29,699
the interface so this would be the vest

523
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,169
in this case where we have these

524
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,510
vibration actuators you need to make

525
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,520
sure that those actuators are actually

526
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,500
working within the range of your

527
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,910
receptors so you have to model every

528
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,280
stage what's the information you care

529
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:44,370
about you know how fast for example can

530
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,780
these actuators actuate and how fast can

531
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:48,060
all of your different receptors pick up

532
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:50,550
information so that's why if you want to

533
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:53,070
design effective effective devices you

534
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:54,600
can't just take a speaker and place it

535
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,550
against the skins playing speech

536
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,679
otherwise most that information is going

537
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:00,000
to get thrown out and averaged away so

538
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,830
you have to really think about the math

539
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,590
that goes behind this and modeling each

540
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:06,720
each stage that's my whole do we have

541
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,370
any input from from you guys honey

542
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,960
you've got decades behind some of the

543
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:13,320
stuff which is way ahead of most of the

544
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,540
rest of us yeah so at this point because

545
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,820
we are in the market and we're selling

546
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,200
the device to the end-user it's

547
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,879
important for us as we're further

548
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,160
developing the device that there's a

549
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,010
good balance between user experience and

550
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,650
the actual development so we're

551
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:30,000
constantly thinking about how how is

552
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,100
this enhancing everyone's quality of

553
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,960
life the people who are using it how are

554
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,429
they able to better perform activities

555
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,740
how can we train them to do it what

556
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,850
other features can we add so those are

557
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,000
questions that were constantly answering

558
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:44,100
or trying to answer but we're always

559
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,020
asking ourselves and you know even at

560
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,820
the end of our clinical trials where

561
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,129
we're doing research and development we

562
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:53,399
always go back to the end user and we do

563
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:54,930
you know focus group and talk about what

564
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,430
was your experience like in a dream

565
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,320
world you know what would this look like

566
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,880
because we want to take that feedback

567
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,340
and then further develop in that way so

568
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,050
it's user driven and not just you know

569
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,639
what we're coming up in the lab and then

570
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:07,500
we're all saying oh this is so cool but

571
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,630
it's not really it's not doing anything

572
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,580
for anyone so we always want to make

573
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,710
sure that we are really enhancing

574
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,750
people's independence that's our goal

575
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:17,640
can I also dive in real quick I think

576
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:20,010
that's super important that's the other

577
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,530
fourth major dimensions especially when

578
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:24,220
it comes to sensory augmentation like

579
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,230
training is such

580
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,460
huge component it's not like just that

581
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,080
you can't just go out and design some

582
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,929
product that just immediately works

583
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:35,350
people have to be willing to put in the

584
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:38,799
time and mental energy to use this stuff

585
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:43,799
so the user designs super is like like

586
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:45,850
half of it yeah go ahead

587
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,049
sure what I'm most excited about is

588
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:49,539
actually getting these products and

589
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:52,240
breaking them as far as setting up like

590
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:53,379
confusing and environments where you get

591
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,059
a sense of discovery when I found out

592
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,919
who was on those panels ago I'd really

593
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:59,139
love to get all these things and it's

594
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:00,909
maybe instead of north or a set of

595
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,380
waypoints right I have a friend who does

596
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:07,260
research in local of media and

597
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:10,570
especially particular with mobile

598
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,830
tourism applications and so she was

599
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,240
doing research recently in New Zealand

600
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,740
and then there was an earthquake so

601
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,100
everywhere she went it was just ruined

602
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,630
everything

603
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,158
couldn't happen so what you could

604
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,929
actually end up doing is setting up

605
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,580
waypoints and it's creating sort of

606
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:22,690
obstacle courses for people to follow if

607
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,980
they can instead of following north

608
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,320
they're following like trying to find

609
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,130
some way to get through something I

610
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,830
think I could be an interesting way to

611
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:31,870
make people run into each other there

612
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:40,059
are lots of good ways to communicate

613
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:41,289
using other senses does anybody have any

614
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:43,809
questions real quick but they're really

615
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:46,150
excited about asking um do that and it

616
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:48,070
will go 200 olds I've been real quick go

617
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:50,140
ahead yeah I think the other that's the

618
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:51,850
other half of it so I think when I was

619
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,740
talking about my stack of thinking

620
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:54,699
through these devices was like you have

621
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,409
to know like kind of what you're

622
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,150
starting goal is but the other half of

623
00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:59,590
is like what if you don't know what

624
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,750
you're starting goal is and that's I

625
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,918
think that's another that's also another

626
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,690
way of looking at where you're throwing

627
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:06,909
information at yourself and then seeing

628
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,620
like oh it's more of an exploratory

629
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:10,150
thing like is there useful information

630
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,158
here sort of in the same way with the

631
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:13,929
magnetic implants right like when people

632
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,820
started putting those in they had no

633
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:17,679
idea that oh I'm gonna try and design to

634
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,270
I don't know feel these weird

635
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,919
electromagnetic walls and banks or

636
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:23,230
something yeah you get all these sorts

637
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:24,880
of strange discoveries and also when you

638
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,770
just jack in information streams and

639
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:35,350
you're not necessarily trying to

640
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:37,000
optimize for them yeah so one of the

641
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,580
interesting things if you are looking

642
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,570
for

643
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:43,550
in the future to see so there are

644
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:45,830
changes so in this stage for example

645
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:47,419
myself and Scott sometimes I called him

646
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,370
and I said you don't believe this

647
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,650
happened and he says that's exactly what

648
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:55,070
happened to me today as well so there is

649
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:57,200
a there is a first level of of let's

650
00:24:55,070 --> 00:25:00,050
call it generic changes that are going

651
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,290
to happen to anyone that's going to have

652
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:06,230
a specific sense but in the next stage

653
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:09,770
your personality comes into it as well

654
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:11,840
so as we don't as we've done all of us

655
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:15,110
use our ears in the same way because

656
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,240
some of us use our ears to create music

657
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:19,969
and some of these some of us use our

658
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:23,000
ears to listen to music so the same will

659
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:24,860
be with with artificial senses so there

660
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,450
is that the generic things that are

661
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,699
going to happen to everybody but from a

662
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:31,610
moment onwards there's gonna be okay

663
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:34,280
I took it to this direction and you took

664
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:36,560
it to this direction and and the impacts

665
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:41,030
are going to be slightly different based

666
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:43,159
on who you are the song can you hear me

667
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:46,460
yes my question is for leave you

668
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:50,150
yes so Neil Harbison from the cyborg

669
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:53,570
nest his color site didn't happen in a

670
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:55,130
day or a week or a year his current

671
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:57,590
arrangement was arrived at through a

672
00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:01,190
series of iterations on on the

673
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:04,070
technology which he had a lot of direct

674
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:06,620
control over since he was the first and

675
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:08,990
I think only user so I wonder if you

676
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,520
have a feedback model for users of the

677
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:14,840
north sense and I wonder how you get

678
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:17,840
feedback about its operation so if I got

679
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,820
your question right so so right now you

680
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,379
and Scott are talking back and forth is

681
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,179
there once you release it to everybody

682
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,910
is there a model as therefore right I

683
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:28,100
said I said we're gonna launch a big

684
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:30,350
research that is going to involve

685
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,350
everybody who will want to be part of it

686
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:38,209
out of the people that bought the nod

687
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:40,939
sense and again it's an exciting place

688
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:43,520
for the science community and for us as

689
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,860
well because as you say in in Harbeson

690
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,410
is an amazing person but he's the only

691
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:50,090
person that has that specific sensor now

692
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:52,070
there's going to be a

693
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:54,799
group of people having the same thing so

694
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:57,289
you could start seeing okay well we

695
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,620
share the places where we all have the

696
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:03,080
same impact which other places where

697
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,520
things become different or which are the

698
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,799
places where we thought this is going to

699
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:09,400
be impacted there is no impact

700
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:12,020
so definitely as there is a there is a

701
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:14,630
that's that for me that's the exciting

702
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:17,480
that was always the exciting part at the

703
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:21,140
end of the day to see the big impact

704
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:25,399
because we are creating a very personal

705
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:27,770
product but the idea is that that notion

706
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:29,770
of having artificial senses is something

707
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:33,830
that's going to change humanity in

708
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:35,750
general as us also starting to

709
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:38,750
understand the bigger picture is the

710
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:40,730
exciting part so what I really want to

711
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:43,220
know about is do you already have a

712
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,960
model for how that interaction works or

713
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:47,809
is it just kind of a free and open

714
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,880
landscape the the interaction of the of

715
00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:52,370
the research right so how do people who

716
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,110
have the north's sense you supply

717
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:59,090
information back to you and how do you

718
00:27:54,110 --> 00:28:03,678
we have a we have a team of researchers

719
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:06,139
that are going to work with them and the

720
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,649
idea is that it the research is going to

721
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:12,409
be built on three stages there is the I

722
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:16,158
would call it the the physical stage so

723
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:18,230
there was this experiment or test done

724
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,710
with cab drivers in Londo and I don't

725
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:23,840
know how a few people know but those

726
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:26,149
cabs in the famous black cabs in London

727
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,039
to be to be a driver or one of these

728
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:29,779
ones you have to go through probably one

729
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,480
of the hardest schools in the world you

730
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:34,370
learn about three years and I think

731
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,370
maybe I am wrong but only around 39

732
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:40,250
percent of the people graduate or get

733
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:43,129
the license and then they started

734
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:45,380
scanning the brains of these people and

735
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:48,169
they saw that there was a physical

736
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:51,770
change in their brain so a place called

737
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:54,830
the hippocampus physically grew and and

738
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:57,440
changed the shape of it so there is

739
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:59,600
there are going to be you know so we're

740
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,120
going to check if any of that will

741
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,699
happen to the people that are owning the

742
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,820
north side

743
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:09,779
including ourselves then there is more

744
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:12,149
the behavioral part let's call it or the

745
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:15,119
psychological part to start to

746
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:16,709
understand you know things like I was I

747
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,279
was telling now different different

748
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:22,109
impacts on your life and the third

749
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:25,320
pillar or layer of the research is to

750
00:29:22,109 --> 00:29:28,980
try to understand and again this will be

751
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:31,168
a part of shooting not in the dark but

752
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:33,899
shooting very far and try to understand

753
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:36,869
again what will be the implications on

754
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:40,369
the bigger picture is humanity how

755
00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:42,720
humanity with artificial senses and with

756
00:29:40,369 --> 00:29:44,488
additions to the body is going to look

757
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,779
in a few years from now how does this

758
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:47,279
reflect on some of your research you

759
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:48,749
said you talked about how different

760
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,669
societies interact with our senses in

761
00:29:48,749 --> 00:29:52,559
different ways and we refer to it

762
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:53,940
briefly that yeah there's a vast

763
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,350
spectrum of the world that we don't

764
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:58,139
perceive because we just don't have the

765
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:59,340
senses to do it and as we take on those

766
00:29:58,139 --> 00:30:00,988
we're obviously gonna have different

767
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,658
cultural reactions to those things so

768
00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:05,369
yeah one thing I'm interested in is how

769
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:06,989
you use senses differently over time and

770
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:09,988
in different circumstances and I think

771
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:11,669
that as we get to use these things more

772
00:30:09,989 --> 00:30:13,049
ubiquitously that we're gonna start

773
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:15,239
finding new ways that they get

774
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:16,830
information into us so I can't remember

775
00:30:15,239 --> 00:30:20,669
the the citation off the top of my head

776
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:21,720
I know I saw a talk about it talking

777
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:24,210
about how I I'm pretty sure was

778
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,830
Polynesian sailors would navigate when

779
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:28,109
it was cloudy by strapping someone

780
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:30,149
usually a blind person to the mast and

781
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:31,289
because of the depth of the ocean there

782
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:33,059
they could actually navigate where they

783
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:34,350
were going based on that alone there was

784
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:36,749
a skill that you developed over decades

785
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:38,699
and so I think that after decades is

786
00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:40,919
when we're really going to get to start

787
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,559
understanding the real nuances of what

788
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:46,799
it is that we're doing here any other

789
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:50,269
questions from the audience then we'll

790
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:54,600
get you Nick we only have a few minutes

791
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:57,269
so yeah I want to know from any or all

792
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,738
of you how you think each of these

793
00:30:57,269 --> 00:31:02,129
senses and technologies might interact

794
00:30:58,739 --> 00:31:15,629
with infants and children so infants or

795
00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:16,320
children use the brain I think we I'm

796
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:20,699
very interests

797
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:25,350
in that place so I think if you look at

798
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:27,179
the education system so I grew up in the

799
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:30,600
place where in the age where the

800
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:32,460
internet grew up and we did not have the

801
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,309
internet so we had books that you had to

802
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:38,009
go and you have the the whole idea of a

803
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:40,799
school was to gain knowledge now the

804
00:31:38,009 --> 00:31:43,169
whole idea of a school doesn't doesn't

805
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,700
go anywhere to gain knowledge you know

806
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:47,130
physical knowledge because you can learn

807
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,830
things if you develop curiosity in a

808
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:51,539
person he can go and learn things by

809
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:54,408
himself so you don't need someone to

810
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:57,419
force him to learn something so I

811
00:31:54,409 --> 00:32:00,269
believe that schools and education in

812
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:02,879
the future will become places where it's

813
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:06,269
not about learning in which year World

814
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:08,279
War two started but exactly to learn to

815
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:10,679
experience the world through new senses

816
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:13,529
through new things to new abilities so

817
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:15,600
you'll basically once you graduate or

818
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:20,309
you'll be kind of a grown up you're a

819
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:23,129
person that has a much wider range of

820
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:25,678
abilities and understanding of the place

821
00:32:23,129 --> 00:32:28,049
that you are part of then when you

822
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,870
started the education system so I think

823
00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:34,470
that kids and the young ages are are

824
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:36,000
extremely important and to get there you

825
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:39,480
need the rest you want to refer to that

826
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,629
kid so at the brain port we have just

827
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,759
started working with kids we think that

828
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:47,279
kids will probably be are our target

829
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:50,129
audience in the future because they're

830
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,929
you know they're like sponges and able

831
00:32:50,129 --> 00:32:54,600
to pick up on things a lot quicker and

832
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:56,279
also we're hoping that you know over

833
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,689
time wearable technology something like

834
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:59,460
the brain port is gonna become the norm

835
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:01,139
so if you start with kids and introduce

836
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,970
it in the classroom now you know when

837
00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:04,379
they're in kindergarten once they're in

838
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:06,029
high school they're not gonna feel so

839
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:08,309
self-conscious that's you know another

840
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:10,710
thing about technology that they that

841
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:12,000
people have to wear how how did they

842
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:14,639
feel do they feel like they're fitting

843
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,500
in society and its you know thankfully

844
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:18,449
it's not just about disabilities they're

845
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,879
not just assistive anymore I mean we're

846
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:22,440
hearing on the panel today is that this

847
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:24,600
is becoming the norm but if you

848
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,340
introduce it into the school systems not

849
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,350
only are you starting to teach some of

850
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,549
these things to blind children but

851
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,379
you're also teaching them

852
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:34,350
you know to integrate with her their

853
00:33:31,379 --> 00:33:35,879
friends and to be more social so that's

854
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,549
definitely where we're headed we have

855
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:40,379
applied for funding to work with kids

856
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:41,879
you know hopefully fingers crossed we'll

857
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:43,860
be able to do that so that we could

858
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:45,748
start testing some of these things you

859
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:51,559
know more scientifically and gaining

860
00:33:45,749 --> 00:33:56,309
more evidence so so you mentioned the

861
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:58,350
hippocampus how much of you know prior

862
00:33:56,309 --> 00:34:00,840
to integrating these technologies into

863
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:03,149
people do you do like brain scans to get

864
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,799
a baseline and then do another brain

865
00:34:03,149 --> 00:34:07,080
scan later to see if there's any changes

866
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:12,899
going on how much that is actually being

867
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:15,808
done so it's gonna get myself and Scott

868
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:18,629
one again one of the cofounders of no

869
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:22,859
sense we've we've fitted their nonsense

870
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:24,750
on our on our body a month ago and in

871
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:27,899
about two three weeks I hope we're gonna

872
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:31,199
start shipping the North sensors to all

873
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:33,839
the people that preorder them so very

874
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:36,270
soon after everything is going to happen

875
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:41,879
all the research stage is gonna is gonna

876
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:43,739
kick off from from day zero yeah for us

877
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:45,389
we haven't started with F we haven't

878
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:47,489
done anything like fMRI for brain scans

879
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:49,710
yet but I think as soon as we're feeling

880
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:51,868
really comfortable about things and we

881
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:53,250
start getting kind of really really

882
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:54,389
great results from the field research

883
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,399
we're probably gonna run some fresh

884
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:58,140
people and do these sorts of studies I

885
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,640
know I think the brain port with the tdu

886
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,500
there's been a number of my studies

887
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,890
which are pretty pretty cool yeah they

888
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:07,589
are yeah so what has been found is when

889
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:09,900
a person initially is training the

890
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:12,270
tactile areas the brain are are

891
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,280
activated but after they learn how to

892
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:16,349
train in the visual cortex which is

893
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,200
responsible for vision is activated so

894
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:20,369
we know that the way that people who are

895
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,868
blind this is only in people who are

896
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:23,640
blind which is not the same for people

897
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,750
who are sighted but people are blind the

898
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,058
way they're processing this information

899
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:29,520
on the tongue is the same way the vision

900
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:32,549
is processed so it's it's been you know

901
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:35,299
very interesting findings on that I got

902
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:35,299
time for one more question

903
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,840
so specifically for people who have new

904
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:46,580
senses and sensory augments that are

905
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,350
kind of always on like the north sense

906
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,490
what happens when you're asleep or

907
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:51,740
otherwise unconscious

908
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:53,509
oh so the north sense now is when I go

909
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:57,200
to sleep and it goes to sleep with me

910
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:59,200
and it wakes up with me together so it

911
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:04,490
doesn't doesn't bother me in any way

912
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:09,799
while sleeping how I sleep with it old

913
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:12,049
everyday I don't died so I as I brush my

914
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:15,140
teeth in the morning I take the nonsense

915
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:16,640
off for a second I clean it if I need to

916
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,920
and I put it back as I put the

917
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:23,240
toothbrush back but except that it's

918
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:25,610
always there and I shall with it I do

919
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,580
everything with it it's waterproof so I

920
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:31,220
don't you don't have the need to take it

921
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:33,950
off anytime it's completely comfortable

922
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:36,080
it's you know I don't I don't feel it I

923
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:37,660
don't know it's there and this it's

924
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:41,299
vibrating because I'm facing you know

925
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:43,549
like you had that I've had dreams where

926
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,840
I used my magnetic sense in the dream I

927
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:51,650
know there have been a few other people

928
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:52,520
have had similar experiences for me yeah

929
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:54,440
that's how it's been

930
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,110
yeah well that's actually one of the

931
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,120
things I think Neil says about really

932
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,260
coming to Intuit a new sense is that

933
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,150
once you start dreaming in it then you

934
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,070
know it's really a part of who you are

935
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:05,870
at that point we're running low on time

936
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,070
but I did want to tell folks here if

937
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:09,529
this kind of stuff interest you there

938
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:12,500
are projects in ways that you can get

939
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:13,910
involved here bulls are becoming a thing

940
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,950
right now we didn't really talk a lot

941
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,629
about putting in new sensory data

942
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:19,879
through our ears but we can process a

943
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:21,620
ton of stuff through your ears and so

944
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,470
there's a lot of stuff on the horizon of

945
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:25,940
feeding new sensory data through hero

946
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:28,160
bulls there's a project similar to this

947
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:30,230
called phantom terrains Frank Swain and

948
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:34,310
another guy were on it where he walked

949
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:35,480
around and could hear Wi-Fi and then

950
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:38,110
there's a couple things if you have

951
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:42,380
Android there's chroma phone with a K

952
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:45,320
and that lets you hear colors kind of

953
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:48,010
like Neal's setup is but it's not quite

954
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:51,050
as as interesting but there's a little

955
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:53,600
grid line on the phone

956
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,980
and you can change his pitch if there's

957
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,330
a different color and then there's a

958
00:37:54,980 --> 00:38:00,380
similar thing of the BrainPort called

959
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:02,450
the voice which has a scanning frequency

960
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,830
and tries to let you see through through

961
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,819
your ears so if you're interested in

962
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,590
this there's a ton of stuff that's

963
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,060
actually happening in this space there's

964
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:10,340
a lot of research that's been doing it

965
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,560
but I'm sure they'd love to talk to you

966
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,390
some more I know

967
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:16,850
Patricia and Scott are actually in the

968
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:19,310
hub this weekend so please stop by try

969
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:21,170
on the best go touch the brain port and

970
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:25,400
put it in your mouth if she'll let you

971
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:28,490
and you really want to okay but thanks

972
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:31,980
for coming appreciate having you out

973
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:31,979
[Applause]
