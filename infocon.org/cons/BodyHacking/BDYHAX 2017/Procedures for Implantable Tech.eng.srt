1
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,340
I'm a biohacker I've been involved in a

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,629
lot of it

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:18,100
grinding community I'm primarily

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:22,010
considered a kind of medical/surgical

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:24,110
body-mod person and the rarely though is

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,970
I'm neither a physician and I'm only a

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,310
novice body-mod artist they're

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,169
definitely more experienced modification

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,669
artists out there and some are willing

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,500
to perform procedures like magnet

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,120
implants but I don't know of any

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,820
developing devices or teaching the

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,500
skills needed to perform procedures for

14
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,300
example Steve Hayworth is involved with

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,580
cyborg Ness and was amongst the first to

16
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,930
offer magnet implants but he really

17
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,839
isn't someone most bio hackers could

18
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,370
call up and ask for advice I'm also not

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,390
a surgeon I work in the medical field

20
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,849
though and I've been in enough

21
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,110
procedures to know that I did my skills

22
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,559
or knowledge are on par with even a

23
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,879
mediocre surgeon but surgeons are

24
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,769
understandably unwilling to implant

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,680
homemade devices and most aren't really

26
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,180
even willing to give advice I'm not

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,100
trying to be modest I am skilled at what

28
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,229
I do however every time I perform a body

29
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,000
mod or give medical advice I try to

30
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:12,710
emphasize that I'm operating to the best

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,190
of my knowledge and my knowledge is

32
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,320
limited

33
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,300
I'm usually hesitant to speak in

34
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,678
absolutes but I've been active in the

35
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,209
bio hacking community for a long time

36
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:22,399
and I've recently realized something I

37
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:24,979
am absolutely sure about someone is

38
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:26,539
going to die okay something is some

39
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:29,030
point will go wrong a bio hacker will

40
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:30,080
end up dead in fact I'm so concerned

41
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,050
with this I think we need to start using

42
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,270
the slogan bio hackers die and I know

43
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,440
just humor me on this grinders are

44
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,240
community committed to radically

45
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,190
altering the body sometimes this takes

46
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,339
the form of treatments using devices

47
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:44,929
like transcranial magnetic or DC

48
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,700
stimulation and other times it's through

49
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:48,979
the use of previously untested chemicals

50
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,360
and sometimes the illustrations are

51
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,179
achieved through the implantation of

52
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,250
devices what I'd like to focus on today

53
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:58,580
is why despite all these risks being

54
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,720
taken a grinder hasn't died yet okay the

55
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,539
majority of you are probably familiar

56
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,489
with Tim cannon and circadian plant I'm

57
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:08,000
gonna read three comments I found posted

58
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:09,140
about Tim comment one is you idiots need

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,580
to look more into the potential

60
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,708
side-effects prior to doing these things

61
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,270
so this comment shows people to assume

62
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:15,860
grinders are ignorant about the risks of

63
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,510
what we're doing and they disregard the

64
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,420
months and in some cases even years

65
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,129
dedicated to researching a project okay

66
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,078
a comment - I guess if you want

67
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:25,609
flesh-eating bacteria sepsis and such

68
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,430
get one stuck in your body at a chop

69
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,290
shop

70
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,329
so on top of being ignorant apparently

71
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,828
grinders are also incompetent people

72
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:33,450
assume grinders are doing implants

73
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:36,269
without any regard for sterility or

74
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,589
safety comment 3 when it comes to

75
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:39,540
something like cutting someone's body

76
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,310
open skin open and putting some foreign

77
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,140
object under the skin then it should be

78
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,480
done by professional people not just

79
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,309
people at home yet this comment is an

80
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,929
admission that yes someone out there

81
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,609
does have the knowledge and skills to do

82
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,819
the stuff grinders are working on but

83
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:54,959
the assumption is it's just not us I

84
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,730
think the best way to address these

85
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,109
concerns is by showing how much

86
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,899
knowledge and skill it goes into even

87
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:02,400
the most basic of procedures first off I

88
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,650
have to admit yes to their art Granger's

89
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,879
performed procedures in their garages it

90
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,670
sounds terrible unless you've actually

91
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,500
been in one of these places they may be

92
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,030
Spartan compared to a fully stocked ER

93
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,099
but the ones I've seen are more than

94
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,620
adequate my procedure room has an

95
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,970
overhead surgical lighting system

96
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,920
adjustable procedure chair all the

97
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,900
surfaces are non porous and wipeable

98
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,149
there's a scrub sink and positive

99
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,950
pressure HEPA filtered air supply

100
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,019
there's sharps disposal area and most

101
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,629
importantly most importantly the rooms

102
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,949
setup to be easily cleaned okay now this

103
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:34,709
is usually the first point of contention

104
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:36,060
clean isn't good enough right for some

105
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:38,370
reason people think operating rooms are

106
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,980
sterile they aren't there are three

107
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,090
similar concepts people get confused

108
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:45,209
sterilization disinfection and

109
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,680
antisepsis antisepsis antiseptics are

110
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,750
cleansers intended to minimize the

111
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,250
number of pathogens on the skin you

112
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,599
can't sterilize skin there's no way to

113
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,030
eliminate all contaminants without

114
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,069
killing yourselves as well there's a lot

115
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,750
of confusion regarding antiseptics for

116
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,510
example the antibiotic soaps like Daioh

117
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,769
contain an agent called triclosan

118
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,090
triclosan is worse than plain soap

119
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:03,900
because it kills some of the bacteria if

120
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,709
it doesn't kill the ones that really

121
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,900
matter

122
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,099
staph survives just fine but you wipe

123
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,040
out all the other bacteria that would've

124
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:12,238
had to compete against alcohols also

125
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,129
have limited usefulness as it doesn't

126
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,190
kill pathogens responsible for diseases

127
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:18,750
like hepatitis and HIV most grinders are

128
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,820
currently using they're a mixture of 70%

129
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,729
alcohol with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate

130
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,500
or approved on iodine 12% either of

131
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:27,150
these are effective antiseptics and

132
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,130
iodine is nice because it's easy to

133
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,539
visualize where it's applied I prefer a

134
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,909
chlorhexidine because it's been shown to

135
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:33,479
have residual action for hours after

136
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:36,450
application

137
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:38,070
now disinfection this is the application

138
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,020
of a chemical which kills the majority

139
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,219
of infectious agents on a surface

140
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,650
operating rooms are cleaned and

141
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,509
disinfected between uses ideally an O R

142
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,280
would be sterilized true but chemical

143
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:48,930
sterilants like formaldehyde or

144
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,698
glutaraldehyde they're toxic and

145
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,470
corrosive fortunately there is a

146
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,479
disinfectant recommended recommended by

147
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,240
the CDC which is inexpensive and easy to

148
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,740
acquire it's bleach bleach is highly

149
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,479
effective at destroying even spores if

150
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,490
used appropriately for disinfection

151
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,289
grinders have been using bleach with a 1

152
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,569
to 10 dilution surfaces are kept damp

153
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:10,620
for about 20 minutes which actually

154
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:12,150
exceeds the CDC guidelines finally

155
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,460
sterilization this is the elimination of

156
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,840
all life sterilizations use for any

157
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,060
device or instrument which touches an

158
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,099
incision the two most common methods are

159
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,069
steam sterilization via an autoclave or

160
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:25,440
ethylene oxide gas eeo gas is a process

161
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:27,150
most commonly used by manufacturers it's

162
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,530
great because it can sterilize equipment

163
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,229
at low temperatures but it's rather

164
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,219
dangerous and expensive to work with

165
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:34,680
grinders who only occasionally perform

166
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:37,289
procedures purchase vo gas process

167
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,699
single-use instruments like these but

168
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:40,229
those who intend to do procedures more

169
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,819
often usually prefer reusable

170
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:43,979
instruments which need to be processed

171
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:45,750
in autoclaved reasonable instruments are

172
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:49,080
of much higher quality than disposables

173
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:51,479
I have to autoclaves ones a Ritter m90

174
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,789
22 the others a Mountain Gear Steamworks

175
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:56,159
sterilizer sterilizations achieved by

176
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:58,440
bringing our tools to 120 degrees Kelsi

177
00:05:56,159 --> 00:06:00,990
Asst at a pressure of 15 psi for between

178
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,639
21 and 30 minutes now processing and

179
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,870
sterilizing equipment isn't as simple as

180
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,789
bagging it up and throwing it in the

181
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,590
autoclave fact sterilization techs at

182
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:09,449
hospitals steady for around a year to

183
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,279
become certified tools our first clean

184
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:13,169
using special brushes and with enzymatic

185
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,150
cleansers which break down contaminants

186
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:16,318
they're cleaning off ultrasonic baths

187
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,330
and then treated with lubricants and

188
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,620
protectants the tools and supplies

189
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,568
needed to process certain equipment

190
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,029
somewhat expensive and it does require a

191
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:26,069
degree of know-how but this is a basic

192
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:27,599
prerequisite for grinders ok

193
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:30,060
not a single grinder that I know of has

194
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:32,370
ever contracted a blood-borne pathogen

195
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,659
from a biohacking project you know this

196
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,009
isn't because Gro this is because

197
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,930
grinders have collaborated over the last

198
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:39,270
5 years to develop the knowledge and

199
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,099
skills needed ok so we have a

200
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,630
disinfectant area with sterile tools we

201
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:44,009
applied the appropriate antiseptics at

202
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,500
this point we're both legally and

203
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:48,599
pathologically clean however the next

204
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,190
topics like antibiotics and analgesics

205
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:51,449
and control of bleeding we're gonna

206
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,270
start treading into the kind of legal

207
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:55,780
gray if

208
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:57,400
a blatant black okay some of these

209
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,140
methods I can't use because of where I

210
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,909
live but I'm gonna discuss them because

211
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,169
a lot of grinders are using them in

212
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,120
terms of alagaësia

213
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:06,670
the gold standards infiltration of

214
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,440
lidocaine either 1% or 2% lidocaine is

215
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,510
fine but it's important to use lidocaine

216
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,100
without epi nephron the use of lidocaine

217
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,780
is actually a lot more common in the

218
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,920
body mount community the need think and

219
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,510
I've heard artists advocating for the

220
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,290
use of epinephrine but grinders

221
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,969
generally avoid it

222
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,950
epinephrine constricts blood vessels

223
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,690
which is useful to staunch the flow of

224
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,760
blood and keep lidocaine in the area

225
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,230
longer and distal areas like fingers and

226
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,810
ears though epinephrine can do this so

227
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,710
effectively end up with necrosis

228
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,710
furthermore epinephrine ask cardiac

229
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:34,479
effects it's better to avoid it for

230
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,120
Megan implants most grinders often form

231
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,370
a flex flexor tendon sheath nerve block

232
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,800
this consists of inserting a 25 gauge

233
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,800
needle at a 45 degree angle just distal

234
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,790
palmar crease no blocks can stop pain

235
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,600
for as long as an hour and a half

236
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:52,240
allowing ample time for the procedure

237
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,970
now another options to use topical

238
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,470
lidocaine gel applying 5% top will gel

239
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,210
to an area for around an hour provides

240
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:01,000
adequate those slightly less effective

241
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,919
analgesia usually a minor procedure like

242
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,350
fixing a lacerated finger doesn't

243
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,730
require systemic antibiotics but these

244
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,740
procedures generally aren't leaving

245
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,570
something behind beneath the skin some

246
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,400
grinders have become begun pre

247
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,260
medicating with prophylactic antibiotics

248
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,419
the first-line antibiotic for such

249
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,430
procedures as ancef but most grinders

250
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,380
choose Clini myosin the reason for this

251
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,210
is as much as 10% of people have an

252
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,830
allergy to penicillin and those with a

253
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,109
penicillin allergy are usually allergic

254
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,599
to ancef as well clindamycin doesn't

255
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,830
have that cross reactivity control the

256
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,690
bleeding's achieved you at the use of a

257
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,069
tourniquet you know most first-aid kits

258
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,080
now don't even come with tourniquets

259
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:38,230
because the improper use can lead to

260
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,670
really serious consequences these

261
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,800
problems arise either from applying too

262
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:43,179
much pressure which can damage nerves or

263
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,310
from leading the tourniquet on too long

264
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:46,479
we're fortunate that we'll even have to

265
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,739
worry about the pressure because a

266
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,200
number of products are now being sold

267
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,640
specifically for fingers tearing

268
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,900
tourniquets apply less force than

269
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,970
traditional tourniquets and they cost

270
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,650
around five bucks this combined with the

271
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,060
fact that most procedures take less than

272
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,340
10 minutes actually makes control

273
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,349
bleeding relatively safe these are the

274
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,720
there are alternatives of course like

275
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,160
using a Penrose drain tube after the

276
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,709
tourniquets applied pressure supplied

277
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,089
the finger to effectively exsanguinate

278
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:11,790
the area allowing us to work without any

279
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:13,839
blood to obstruct our view

280
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,670
now so where are we we have a

281
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,959
disinfected area we've got a sterile

282
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,849
tools we have a clean site we're

283
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,649
pain-free antibiotics are on board

284
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,660
bleeding is controlled you know we're

285
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:24,209
ready to start well actually first we

286
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,740
have to plan where we're going to incise

287
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:29,018
skin does have a grain much like wood

288
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,279
collagen fibers naturally orient in one

289
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:32,769
direction resulting in what are called

290
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:33,879
lingers liens if we cut the direction of

291
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:36,250
the lines we get quicker and more

292
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:37,689
esthetic healing in addition to this we

293
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,220
need to study underlying structures so

294
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:41,949
we can avoid any large vessels or nerves

295
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:44,050
after we mark out our plant site we're

296
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:45,790
ready to cut okay some grinders use

297
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,920
large gauge gauge needles or even

298
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:50,019
injectors to place magnets but it's more

299
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,639
common to use either a number fifteen or

300
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:53,740
eleven a scalpel blade and number three

301
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,759
handle scalpels held with a pencil grip

302
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,680
and the dominant hand while the

303
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:57,129
non-dominant hand provides tension on

304
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,560
the skin

305
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,939
okay the initial incision created

306
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,739
slightly larger than the object being

307
00:10:00,939 --> 00:10:04,660
planted and once we've gotten to the sub

308
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,370
dermis the artist chooses between sharp

309
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,439
or blunt dissection sharp dissection

310
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,790
causes less trauma to the area but comes

311
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:12,069
with the added risk of cutting through

312
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,660
an important structure like a nerve some

313
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:15,729
artists have even developed personalized

314
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,170
tools to assist in blunt dissection

315
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,819
although the tips of a pair of

316
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,769
Metzenbaum scissors is more than

317
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:22,839
adequate at this point we create a

318
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:24,370
pocket for the implant pocket should

319
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:26,350
actually be as large as needed to find

320
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,089
skin laxity we want some loose skin so

321
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,589
that after the implant is placed the

322
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:32,769
incision can be approximated without

323
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:34,420
being under tension now closing the

324
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:36,160
incision should be performed using a non

325
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,990
absorbable suture like polypropylene and

326
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,750
with a 3/8 curvature reverse cutting

327
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,880
needle one or two sutures are placed

328
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,680
using instrument ties tourniquet is then

329
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,839
removed we let a small ibadah blood out

330
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,609
flushing out the wound apply pressure

331
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:50,670
for a minute and the bleeding stops the

332
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,959
wound is then dressed with steri-strips

333
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,279
healing takes around three weeks during

334
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,050
this time the focus is on controlling

335
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,120
inflammation using ice and ibuprofen

336
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:00,160
sutures pulled sometime between day

337
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,870
three and seven after which steri-strips

338
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,850
are kept on to prevent reopening

339
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,800
collagen fibers reinforce the wound

340
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,209
after a month although wound maturation

341
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,750
and remodeling could take as long as a

342
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:12,550
year I hope I've gotten my point across

343
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,160
despite how simple something like a

344
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:16,779
magnet implant seems to be being it

345
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,969
right requires a lot of work and a lot

346
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:21,040
of research and grinders are doing exact

347
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,689
leave this believe it or not that was

348
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,879
the short version we've skipped over a

349
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:26,740
ton you know it's important to learn

350
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:27,939
proper technique to wash your hands you

351
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,829
need to pay attention to selecting the

352
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:31,269
right tools and we didn't talk about how

353
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:32,620
to set up a sterile field or the

354
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:34,779
difference between surgical and exam

355
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,459
gloves I could probably talk for the

356
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:38,050
next hour without exhausting all the

357
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:40,359
considerations the grinders put into

358
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,979
procedures my point is that grinders

359
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,290
performing procedures or anything but

360
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,089
ignorant and incompetent okay and while

361
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,430
there may be safer and better ways to do

362
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:49,540
these things we're going after that you

363
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,910
know we're always learning we're always

364
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,019
working to hone our skills okay short of

365
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,699
having a physician perform these

366
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:57,970
procedures there really isn't anyone out

367
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:59,649
there I'd trust so why is it that I'm

368
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:02,259
convinced someone is going to die

369
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:03,970
in 2011 there was a BMG case report

370
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:06,490
titled body piercing with fatal

371
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,139
consequences which described a man in

372
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,329
his 50s who died from a mesenteric

373
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:12,009
infarct secondary to umbilical piercings

374
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:13,899
this means that over time his

375
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:16,139
bellybutton piercing migrated deep into

376
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:18,430
his abdomen and blocked off blood supply

377
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:20,199
mesenteric infarct SAR on my list of

378
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,300
most terrible ways to die I've seen a

379
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:24,490
few my career person shows up to the air

380
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,559
and they're complaining of abdominal

381
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,540
pain and swelling when they're opened up

382
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,490
for exploratory surgery the GI tract is

383
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,099
found to be gray and dead there is

384
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,540
nothing to do it's already too late they

385
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,339
close the person up and tell them to say

386
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,079
goodbye to their loved ones patient

387
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,250
usually dies within 24 hours and you

388
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,319
know the engineer because they start

389
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,639
vomiting feces okay

390
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:44,860
this wasn't a unique his situation

391
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,079
either people do die from body piercings

392
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,120
and ABC article in 2009 reported that a

393
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:51,399
22 year old man died from multiple brain

394
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,949
abscesses related to an infected tongue

395
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:55,750
piercing 2005 a 17 year old boy from

396
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:57,490
Britain died of septicemia which was

397
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,500
traced to a recent recent lip piercing

398
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,959
okay I'm convinced someone is going to

399
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,389
die because between two and four deaths

400
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:07,089
a year on average in the US occur from

401
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:08,620
shaking vending machines okay

402
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:11,050
even people who take every precaution

403
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,759
and a meticulous about aftercare are

404
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,859
taking a risk a small risk but

405
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,809
nonetheless risk and what I'm concerned

406
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,300
about is the backlash from that first

407
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:21,790
inevitable death okay the media has been

408
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,050
too kind to biohackers so far a lot of

409
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,309
what we've been done has been painted in

410
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,540
the most complimentary of lights

411
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:27,009
you know people been sticking metal and

412
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,959
whatnot through the skin going back to

413
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:30,339
antiquity but make it a magnet and

414
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,579
suddenly we're innovators who've been

415
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:33,890
invented in extras

416
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,360
okay our food technology goes back to

417
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:37,850
World War two the healthcare industry

418
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,200
even tried in the early 2000s to use our

419
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,269
fits to track medical histories

420
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,149
however bio plaque biohackers implant

421
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:45,709
them the media calls us cyborgs okay

422
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:47,540
everything we do gets sensationalized

423
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:48,500
100-fold I've been in an interview and

424
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,319
had the journalist asked me the same

425
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,120
question in different forms over and

426
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,100
over until I finally answered in a way

427
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,440
that focused on how risky what we do is

428
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,360
we all know if it bleeds it leads and

429
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,820
let's be honest a magnet implant is if

430
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,260
anything safer than a piercing we open a

431
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,149
small hole with sterile instruments and

432
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,529
close it back up a piercing is intended

433
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:08,180
remain open and represents a risk of

434
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:09,920
infection even years later when we

435
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:13,750
played along with the media and making

436
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,680
the procedures we do seem risky okay

437
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,360
we've actually been helping to build

438
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,979
this narrative and the higher we build

439
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,769
it the farther we're going to fall when

440
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,880
that first death occurs we already know

441
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:24,589
what they're going to say don't we

442
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,820
they're going to say work that we're too

443
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:27,050
ignorant and we should have all locked

444
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,000
in to the risks of what we're doing

445
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,709
they're going to say that will get

446
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,079
sepsis and flesh-eating bacteria and

447
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:34,760
it's soo more incompetent they'll say

448
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:36,589
procedures like this should be left to

449
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,560
someone else someone else who has the

450
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,970
knowledge and competency to do it right

451
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,680
the nature of sensationalism means

452
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:44,329
no-one's going to write about the twenty

453
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,920
minutes I just spent talking to you guys

454
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:48,229
about the relative benefits of

455
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,540
disinfectants okay what we need to do is

456
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:53,360
define the inevitable now we need to own

457
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,860
it now okay and as a society we already

458
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,589
make decisions about which deaths are

459
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,899
okay in the u.s. or over 32,000 motor

460
00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:01,850
vehicle deaths in 2014 but it would be

461
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,680
ridiculous to talk about banning cars or

462
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,510
making a ten mile per hour speed limit

463
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,729
we risk death out of necessity we

464
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:10,130
haven't seen any cars right we're okay

465
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,690
with this but think about cigarettes CDC

466
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,120
report over four hundred eighty thousand

467
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,770
deaths is being cigarette related people

468
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,750
risk death for short-term pleasure and

469
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,970
we're also for the most part okay with

470
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,829
this but water grinders risking death

471
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,180
for I'm not arrogant enough to think

472
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:25,430
that any of my projects are gonna make

473
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,899
people immortal or cause any positive

474
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,579
sweeping societal changes but I do

475
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:30,529
believe if these happen they're going to

476
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:31,729
be because of people like me you know

477
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,140
they might not even call themselves

478
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,930
grinders but at the very least they'll

479
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,890
be people who share the grinder ethos

480
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,599
we're risking their lives because we

481
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,790
hope to create the futures we desire

482
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,010
this is a better reason to die then so

483
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,839
Bob can make it to the office on time or

484
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:47,510
take the edge off at the end

485
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,850
day right yeah but being a grinder I

486
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:52,150
know the risks and accept them because I

487
00:15:49,850 --> 00:16:02,210
think it's important I accept that

488
00:15:52,150 --> 00:16:04,100
biohackers die thank you thanks Jeff or

489
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,070
not uh my name is Marc and my half of

490
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:10,930
the talk is basically building on Jeff's

491
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:14,410
and that somebody is going to die but

492
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:14,410
hear me out on this

493
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,370
all right so continuing on the theme of

494
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,040
procedures after they've left Jeff's

495
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:23,690
laboratory for example it becomes less

496
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,290
about medical procedures and more maybe

497
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:30,230
about biological and social procedures

498
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:31,790
okay okay all right

499
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,440
so an implant is obviously not this

500
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,630
one-time thing it's in your body until

501
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,340
you take it out so what sort of post

502
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,790
implant procedures need to be considered

503
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,750
but before I get into the thick of this

504
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,010
I'm gonna give you a little bit of my

505
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,500
background to help you contextualise

506
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:47,390
where I'm coming from so I have an

507
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,660
interdisciplinary academic background in

508
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,439
sociology anthropology and criminology

509
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,780
specializing in circulations of

510
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,160
knowledge and social control but I'm

511
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,510
also a grinder I don't think I'm a

512
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,819
particularly good one but a couple

513
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,800
things that I've worked on are subdermal

514
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:04,010
armor which I worked on with Jeff and

515
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,300
I'm currently working on a contraption

516
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,790
that allows you to adjust your

517
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:10,190
drunkenness immediately I'm gonna talk

518
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:11,930
about these a bit more later I think so

519
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,790
my latest research interest back to the

520
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,410
academic kind of thing is on

521
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,450
cross-cultural senses and in

522
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,340
particularly in particular a sensory

523
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,390
modification so when I say I'm going to

524
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,619
be talking about post implantation

525
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,360
procedures I don't just mean the

526
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:25,250
physical and material outcomes but also

527
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,990
some of the social consequences and

528
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,850
they're related and I think that's why

529
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:31,070
they're important so the first thing I'm

530
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,060
going to talk about is briefly I'm going

531
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,340
to talk some of the less discussed

532
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,690
effects of body modification and in

533
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,189
particularly sent some sensory

534
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,930
modification to show why it's important

535
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,580
in general and then I'm going to get to

536
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,640
specifically why I think a grinding is

537
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,110
important and building modifying senses

538
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,880
is important by addressing some of the

539
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,610
common criticisms that I hear through

540
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,600
the work that I do from other people so

541
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,850
the first thing what's the big deal

542
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,149
about senses we all have more or less

543
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:57,469
the same senses but how they're used and

544
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:59,210
regulated and conceptualized and valued

545
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,789
about very

546
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,960
historically from culture to culture so

547
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,390
obviously senses are an important aspect

548
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,429
of how our we develop historically a

549
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,289
couple of quick examples Canada where

550
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:10,940
I'm from largely exist the way does

551
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:13,580
today because Europeans like the feel of

552
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:16,610
fur from the 15th to the 17th century

553
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:19,520
pain pain Spain Portugal England and

554
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:21,469
Holland fought wars over spices in every

555
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,320
cinnamon bun is a little trace amount of

556
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,850
the poor the blood of the Portuguese but

557
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,939
as we learned in Doon the spice must

558
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,918
flow so if you want more if you want a

559
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,450
more recent example of a newly

560
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:33,590
discovered sensory experience that's

561
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,940
sweeping the nation you could think

562
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,559
about something like crystal meth right

563
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,600
that's a battle that's playing out it's

564
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,178
very complicated so the discovery of

565
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,799
things my point is is to sense something

566
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:44,000
is to quickly open up these political

567
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,129
disputes that may surround the

568
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,190
distribution of what is allowed or

569
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,110
considered sensible so senses are also

570
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,179
important to how we organize and are

571
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,490
organized in our day-to-day lives

572
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:58,490
so in this classical sociological study

573
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,899
Cambodia French guy examined how people

574
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,510
came to distinguish their sensory

575
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:04,459
experiences taste develops from infancy

576
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:07,190
but it happens differently for different

577
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,740
people so for example which confers are

578
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,299
consumed and normalized is largely a

579
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:13,340
function of income it's what he found in

580
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:15,799
the 80s in France so low income means

581
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,330
less expensive food out of necessity but

582
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:19,940
this is also accompanied by a culture of

583
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,230
how to present and eat that food so as a

584
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,450
result people who grow up the lower

585
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:26,090
income homes are unlikely to know how to

586
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:28,520
act like a rich person and likewise a

587
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,990
rich person is likely going to have

588
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,809
difficulty fitting in with the common

589
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:34,010
people as a result

590
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:35,629
so the upper-class see the lower-class

591
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:37,700
is culturally naive and the lower-class

592
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,649
see the upper-class is pretentious so

593
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,169
taste his point is that it's largely

594
00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:44,689
unintentionally learned behavior that

595
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:45,799
seems natural to the taster perhaps you

596
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,480
felt this awkwardness when making

597
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:49,820
cultural in the steppes while travelling

598
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,409
now obviously pedagogy was a French guy

599
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,450
and so they have like this deep-seated

600
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:54,830
hatred between classes it's a lot more

601
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,940
apparent than it is here I think I'm not

602
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,860
from here so it may be I shouldn't say

603
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:01,659
that but I mean they did have almost a

604
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:03,649
revolution like 40 years ago but anyways

605
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:05,330
his point was that the way you end up

606
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:07,729
using your senses is tied to its social

607
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,639
context at least in no small parts such

608
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,750
as education or socio-economic mobility

609
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:13,100
so it's not just how they're used but

610
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,440
how it's legitimate to use

611
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,299
sentences the most obvious example I can

612
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,590
think of is sex I don't have any like

613
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,510
peer-reviewed journals to back me up

614
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:23,750
here but it's unquestionably a sensory

615
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,950
experience as I understand it so which I

616
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,600
think everyone can agree with is is

617
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:29,720
highly regulated on multiple levels

618
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,370
right even who gets to know and when and

619
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,840
where and how and at what time of night

620
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,668
on what channel you can see these things

621
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,139
to talk about these things it's all

622
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:37,820
regulated but you can also think about

623
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,789
other sensory experiences that are

624
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,379
supposed to be for example shameful like

625
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:45,320
farting in an elevator or listening to

626
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:47,179
Nickelback so while the government has

627
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,740
an influence via laws and rights we also

628
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,909
regulate ourselves right I mean a few

629
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,350
people at least laugh at that horrible

630
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:52,700
Nickelback joke but like how did you

631
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,799
come to understand that Nickelback's a

632
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:59,000
shameful thing the government never told

633
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:00,440
you that even if maybe they should so

634
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,210
shameful the shamefulness is brought

635
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,289
about by like a social process that is

636
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,570
once again centered on the political

637
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:06,679
distribution of the sensible so my point

638
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,120
is that the way that we organize our

639
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:10,100
lives is around our senses I don't think

640
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,418
that's a very you know controversial and

641
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,399
even though my senses are my own though

642
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:15,380
I may not necessarily fully understand

643
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,620
everything they do how they got this way

644
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,059
and how far the consequence is extended

645
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,860
so I'm gonna get into grinding which is

646
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:23,120
why we're all here anyway I think so

647
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,219
when it comes to being a sociologist I

648
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,360
guess I take that pretty seriously but

649
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,320
when it comes to being a grand I'm a bit

650
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,939
of a jackass

651
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,710
so my interests as a grinder are

652
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,110
disrupting these kind of taken for

653
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,370
granted and nature of our senses

654
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,168
something I do basically cuz I think

655
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,459
it's fun I think it's fun to go around

656
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,970
and do things that you weren't able to

657
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,590
do before

658
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,970
I imagine it's a lot like tasting

659
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:44,178
cinnamon for the first time for those

660
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:46,100
Portuguese people so my latest research

661
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:47,750
combines my academic and Grindr

662
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,730
interests to examine how creating and

663
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,780
modifying senses works out and through

664
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,919
this research I've been in fairly

665
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,539
frequent contact with a number of

666
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,250
grinders about their projects so I feel

667
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:56,780
like I can share with you some follow-up

668
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,659
on what Jeff was talking about about

669
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:01,490
procedures and hopefully they suggest

670
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:02,840
why grinding to find senses is important

671
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:06,049
even if no wars have been fought over

672
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,699
tiny magnets yet so I want to point out

673
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:09,168
a couple quick things first of all I

674
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,000
don't make any money off this so I'm

675
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:12,679
gonna address a couple criticisms that I

676
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,570
commonly hear about grinders or grinding

677
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:16,159
and I think it's gonna be an honest

678
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,960
appraisal based on my own experiences

679
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,190
but also as well think there's things

680
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,200
I've learned from other grinders I

681
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,790
definitely don't speak for grinders

682
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,200
though I'm giving you my opinion which

683
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:26,000
is informed by things I've heard from

684
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,910
them this doesn't mean they're gonna

685
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,130
with me so the first main complaint that

686
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:34,190
I often hear when I present the sort of

687
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:36,710
research that I do is that implants seem

688
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,570
kind of extreme for not much gain simple

689
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:41,360
things like magnets just don't seem

690
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:43,250
worth it so there are that many articles

691
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,959
written about what happens six months or

692
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,030
you know two years after somebody gets a

693
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,260
magnet implant

694
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,399
do they still love it do they hate it

695
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,540
sort of they forget about it what are

696
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,450
the outcomes like what does it actually

697
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:54,470
do for them is it worth it and I think

698
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:57,260
this is actually a really complicated

699
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:59,180
question for the most part for something

700
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,250
like magnets yes people really do love

701
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:03,680
them even much later but they don't love

702
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:05,360
them unconditionally and for a lot of

703
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,330
grinders the magnet itself is maybe not

704
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,250
even the point right now the kinds of

705
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,600
things were working on it's more about

706
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,820
finding out how certain systems work

707
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,889
together you have to find out ways to

708
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,929
successfully put things inside your skin

709
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,790
and this is mostly about finding the

710
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:22,400
right coatings for a particular

711
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:24,649
application so it may be the magnet

712
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,120
isn't exactly the point for us all the

713
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,250
time but whether it works is obviously

714
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,419
still it's important right the outcomes

715
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,090
are different for different people

716
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,310
however so other than death or illness

717
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:36,620
the worst case scenario is usually

718
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:38,450
rejection certain things it's obvious

719
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,979
why it's gonna reject yeah you don't

720
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,600
follow proper procedure you'd do

721
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,100
everything that Jeff said not to do and

722
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,050
you don't do the things he said to do

723
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:48,050
maybe you coded it in something stupid

724
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:49,580
or not at all which I've heard of maybe

725
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,200
you hit it with a pan or maybe you

726
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,460
accidentally cut yourself and it falls

727
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,500
out these are things that you don't

728
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,490
really always think about ahead of time

729
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,940
when you're gonna put something in your

730
00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:01,760
skin but knowing why it rejects is

731
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,740
sometimes difficult people tend to blame

732
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,300
the procedure or the aftercare but it

733
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,290
also could be body chemistry it could be

734
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,000
a number of things that we haven't even

735
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,100
thought of I have a friend who can't

736
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,500
wear a wristwatch because the the

737
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,419
acidity of his skin or his sweat just

738
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,430
corrodes it immediately and he can watch

739
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,900
that happen but if it's implanted inside

740
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:19,490
and you can't watch it happen so that

741
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,650
makes it quite a bit difficult and as a

742
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:23,660
result if you want to diagnose a new

743
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,310
coating you have to put it in wait a few

744
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,440
days cut it out look at it put another

745
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:29,960
one and wait a few weeks and so long

746
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,340
building it up so even if it doesn't

747
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,470
reject however we still have to figure

748
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,570
out like a maximum placement for the

749
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:37,310
greatest efficacy if you take the

750
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,290
placement of a go magnets for example it

751
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,929
actually comes down

752
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:43,240
- I think a decision between

753
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,890
discoverability versus annoyance it's

754
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,630
the most common spot to put a magnet is

755
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,370
in your non-dominant hand on your third

756
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,930
finger on the outside and some people on

757
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,159
the inside is also kind of common and

758
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,540
you put it there because it's out of the

759
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,700
way you can still grab things you can go

760
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,170
about your day and do most of your you

761
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,700
know common tasks without it getting in

762
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:03,430
the way and I have one there and I like

763
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:05,680
it there it's very it's not annoying in

764
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:07,990
any way but at the same time I also have

765
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,510
one of my thumb which I catch on things

766
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:13,450
all the time and I find that I I

767
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:15,129
discover a lot more about the magnetism

768
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:17,440
and the magnetic spectrum of the world

769
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:19,180
out there because it's in this spot that

770
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,300
actually gets in my way along the time

771
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,380
so when you're choosing a spot it

772
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,700
there's pros and cons to different

773
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:28,590
places for it and we're still kind of

774
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:35,110
figuring out which one's work best

775
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:36,129
oh I've also have a head know some

776
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,689
people that have put magnets in their

777
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,680
bodies and lost them they can't find

778
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,880
them and they want to take them out and

779
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,860
they cut themselves open and they're

780
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,390
looking around and so like you just you

781
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:47,860
can forget about it and actually it

782
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:49,270
forgets about you too so these things

783
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,889
are difficult to predict I've seen

784
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:52,450
people with sausage fingers where they

785
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,860
implant on magnet and it's still

786
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,060
sticking out a quarter of an inch and it

787
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,679
gets in their way and they play with it

788
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,570
and it starts to feel like it's bruised

789
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,980
for other people they put a magnet in

790
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:01,720
and it's you can barely tell that they

791
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:05,320
even have one and you really don't know

792
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,970
until you try sometimes it hurts like if

793
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,470
I catch my thumb one while the zipper

794
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,670
gets caught it's painful like very

795
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,260
briefly but I don't think it's a big

796
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:17,110
deal it passes just as quickly as it

797
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:19,000
comes and it's really not that bad so

798
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:20,260
I'm still lucky talking about like

799
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,550
really tiny things in the body I'm using

800
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,680
examples of magnets because they're the

801
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:25,389
most common thing but if we're gonna end

802
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,370
up going full cyborg as some people who

803
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:29,440
want what about larger things that you

804
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:31,030
put in your body this was partially the

805
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,710
reason that Jeff and I built the

806
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:35,980
subdermal body armors to test how much

807
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:38,830
abuse the body can take when you put an

808
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,570
implant in under ideal conditions so we

809
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,100
made a number of prototypes and we

810
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,560
settled on putting a non-newtonian

811
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,600
sponge core sealed and far mat BPT

812
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,490
tubing so the non-newtonian sponge

813
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,620
basically is really soft and pliable and

814
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:52,160
comfortable when you're not hitting it

815
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,350
but as soon as you hit it on some

816
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:59,120
terms really hard we ripped it off of

817
00:26:54,350 --> 00:27:01,159
some motorcycle armor and so after we

818
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,719
implanted it was about the the prototype

819
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:07,220
was just a 2 or 3 inches and we put it

820
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,570
into my forearm and I wanted to have it

821
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,480
in a position where I could use for

822
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:14,030
maximum like karate chopping and for the

823
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,340
most part it worked pretty well I ended

824
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:17,660
up if first of all I had to wait wait

825
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,709
three or four weeks for it to heal

826
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,170
because you can't just go ahead and

827
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:22,580
karate chop right away and right towards

828
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,960
the end of that period I ended up doing

829
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:27,050
some urban exploration where I was

830
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,550
running around in some tunnels and I

831
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:31,940
bashed it on a lot of concrete some

832
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:33,830
exposed rebar and even got cut and it it

833
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,390
ended up migrating a little bit

834
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:37,040
I cannot remember which direction it

835
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:38,000
migrated I can see the two scars but I

836
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,800
don't remember which ones didn't which

837
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,620
ones out but they're like they're like

838
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,120
1/2 inch or 3/4 of an inch apart and so

839
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,709
then it wasn't in an ideal position for

840
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,909
karate chopping anymore which kind of

841
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,670
made me sad so it's something that we're

842
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:52,640
still working on figuring out how to you

843
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:56,180
know nail down a shape that's gonna work

844
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,920
properly but ultimately this this

845
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,960
affected the final testing when I cried

846
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,520
chop some bricks and direct hits worked

847
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,350
really well they didn't hurt at all I

848
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,790
thought it was actually pretty pretty

849
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,620
cool I thought it wasn't gonna work I

850
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:08,090
was kind of just for a laugh but that

851
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,489
was pretty cool I'm gonna work on it

852
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,810
some more I think but if you hit it

853
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,610
indirectly there was a pretty sharp

854
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:18,169
pinching pain so yeah we need to work on

855
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:19,969
a way to hold things together so whether

856
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:21,200
people like their implants my point is

857
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,880
is that after a period of time it really

858
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,790
depends on their placement and how it

859
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,960
works out for your individual situation

860
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:28,850
and that brings me to my second

861
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,040
criticism of grinders which is a quite a

862
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:32,360
bit more abstract and it's that they

863
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,879
haven't really come up with much that's

864
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,199
new magnets and RFID d--'s have been

865
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,220
around for a really long time and

866
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,070
there's been you know a couple really

867
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,770
cool things particularly by grindhouse

868
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:44,240
that have come up but for the most part

869
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:47,720
it's taking a long time to get things

870
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,560
out so why is this so hard in addition

871
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,910
to the fact that we're still figuring

872
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,169
out these systems that's really

873
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,450
difficult to fully appreciate their

874
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,740
potential I think so you take magnets

875
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,230
again since they're the most popular

876
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,670
sensory nod you do get an almost

877
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,830
immediate sense of electromagnetic

878
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:03,290
fields that it's quite rewarding and it

879
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:05,060
feels good but what use is it beyond

880
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,600
feeling good or picking up tiny screws

881
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,940
or winning

882
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,139
our vets well for a lot of grinders

883
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:13,250
that's totally worth it right there

884
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:14,390
already myself included but I think that

885
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,370
magnets are actually only scratching the

886
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:17,570
surface of their potential for three

887
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,649
reasons I don't know that all of these

888
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:20,960
are gonna pan out or anything but I

889
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:22,760
think that they're worth looking into so

890
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,309
the first reason that we're only

891
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,470
scratching the surface is that we just

892
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:29,149
don't have enough practice yet :

893
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,679
Blackmore or Blake more of Cambridge

894
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:33,289
University did this experiment where he

895
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:34,610
raised kittens in cylinders and in the

896
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:36,740
different cylinders he had painted on

897
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,270
different patterns and so one kitten was

898
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,130
raised in a cylinder that had only

899
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,360
horizontal lines in it no one was raised

900
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,230
with only vertical lines and then he

901
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,120
would let them out and he would play

902
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,679
with them and if he held a stick

903
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,059
vertically the vertical stripe do what a

904
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,590
cat would play with it and if you hold

905
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:50,780
it horizontally the horizontal static

906
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,340
cat would play with it but the other cat

907
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,470
the one that wasn't you know the right

908
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,320
orientation would a quote look about

909
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:58,730
vacantly so there's similar though

910
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,649
inconclusive evidence for magnet

911
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:02,030
implants some people that I talk to say

912
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:04,909
that everything feels the same but

913
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:06,408
others have a number of ways of

914
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:07,789
describing how their magnets work for

915
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:10,100
them so one person who had these

916
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:12,770
implants with a he had a particularly

917
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,600
strong magnet implanted like five or six

918
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:17,299
years ago so quite a bit before most

919
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,520
people especially myself he had a lot of

920
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:21,168
ways of describing the way magnetic

921
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,200
fields can feel he talked about

922
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:26,990
screaming cables fuzzy bubbles wires

923
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,100
that whisper or leaky wires eventually

924
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,780
he just ran out of adjectives and

925
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:33,199
started making noises for things that

926
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:34,760
felt different ways like whoop and he's

927
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,309
like that's that feels like that it was

928
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,480
pretty interesting so like kittens maybe

929
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:40,280
we're just not exposed to these new

930
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,750
patterns and in a way that we can make

931
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,120
them sensible yet and it's just going to

932
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,530
take time the second reason I think we

933
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,870
might be only scratching the surface is

934
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:49,940
that our senses are possibly limited by

935
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:51,889
our language and this has real

936
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,570
consequences so I don't have you've

937
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:56,570
heard of the sapir-whorf hypothesis it

938
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:58,990
was a semi popular exaggerated plotline

939
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:01,340
of the current blockbuster movie arrival

940
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,960
and basically what it states is that the

941
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:06,080
structure of language determines or

942
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,460
greatly influences our behavior so for

943
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,168
example there's a study published by the

944
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,370
National Academy of Sciences that show

945
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:12,049
that there are two words in Russian

946
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:13,639
four different shades of blue where

947
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:16,040
English only has one word for it and

948
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,809
that Russian speakers are faster just at

949
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,500
discriminating between these two shades

950
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:21,170
and

951
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,260
speakers are so it seems that words can

952
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:26,210
prime parts of the brain to work better

953
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,080
so how might words affected grinding out

954
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,880
a new sense

955
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,350
well how our sense is limited by

956
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,640
language is the questions it's a

957
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:35,480
difficult question that's why this is

958
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:37,130
kind of disputed or controversial one

959
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,930
thing you think about is how many senses

960
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:40,400
do you have a lot of people say that

961
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,900
they have five senses and this goes back

962
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,970
to Aristotle or if you want to be really

963
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,650
a critical speck to Heraclitus but it

964
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:50,090
doesn't matter just all made it popular

965
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:51,890
anyways so he basically his system is

966
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:53,389
that you have a dedicated receptor for

967
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:55,220
each sense you see with your eyes and

968
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:56,510
hear with your ears and so on but even

969
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,080
by that definition you would also have

970
00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:01,370
proprioception or a vestibular sense and

971
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,139
some people would even argue for a Romeo

972
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:05,229
nasal sense they use smell pheromones

973
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:08,030
now the difficulty with that is that

974
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:10,310
because it produces no concept conscious

975
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:12,050
reaction people don't know whether it

976
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:15,379
works or how exactly it would work in a

977
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:16,879
human beyond that the sense of touch

978
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,980
involves different receptors for pain

979
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,810
cold heat and pressure so is that one

980
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,060
sensor for sense other senses work

981
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:25,700
together like your sight or sorry like

982
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:27,409
sound sorry the touch and sound at a

983
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,030
loud concert and sometimes they

984
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,990
contradict each other like sound insight

985
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,160
and then McGurk effect

986
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,660
I don't feel familiar with the McGurk

987
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,160
effect we should definitely look it up

988
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,650
on YouTube is it's a really trippy way

989
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,380
of ruining your aural sense with your

990
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:40,310
visual sense and they contradict so you

991
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,960
can't even really separate them

992
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,760
sometimes so what is a sense it's not

993
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,960
really a settled idea and so our

994
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,550
language about what we're actually

995
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,040
trying to do or how we think about it

996
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:51,350
might be holding us back kind of drive

997
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,240
this point a bit further consider a

998
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:55,189
trickier kind of sense maybe once you

999
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,450
get out of this five sense that you have

1000
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,760
five senses to go with your sense of

1001
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,710
time how do you make sense of time on a

1002
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,450
sensory level certainly your body has

1003
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,950
all sorts of reactions to the cycle of

1004
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:06,680
the Sun like production levels of

1005
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:07,550
vasoactive intestinal peptide but how

1006
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,650
does your language affect your

1007
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:11,440
understanding of it and some cultures

1008
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:14,180
instead of having a past present future

1009
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,240
orientation that they talk about they

1010
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:18,920
can see the of time as an oscillating

1011
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,350
opposites so you have day and night but

1012
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,960
you also have now and not now instead of

1013
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:25,129
past present future so recently I was

1014
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,420
reading some ethnographic research

1015
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,450
published by the University of

1016
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,860
California Press and it really showed

1017
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,029
that this can have like symptoms huge

1018
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:34,729
consequences

1019
00:33:32,029 --> 00:33:37,279
the the study was about this crisis in

1020
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:39,080
the rising suicide rates of the Inuit of

1021
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,549
Baffin Island and the government was

1022
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,259
throwing tons of money in debt trying to

1023
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:44,120
tell them you know this promising future

1024
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:45,379
you have this promising future don't and

1025
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,959
you know trying to work people towards

1026
00:33:45,379 --> 00:33:50,870
that kind of response and it didn't work

1027
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,129
at all because in that culture they

1028
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:54,739
don't conceive of the future in the same

1029
00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:56,178
way they see it is now or not now so

1030
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,740
they don't have a future like we see it

1031
00:33:56,179 --> 00:33:59,450
in using those words actually or not

1032
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,649
being able to use those words completely

1033
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:06,230
affects the way that you think about

1034
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:07,158
time so if we're trying to figure out

1035
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:09,079
new sentence and how they work with

1036
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:11,750
existing senses or how their outcomes

1037
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:12,980
might take a while this might be you

1038
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,780
know this might be a long time it might

1039
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,069
take a lot of experimentation we

1040
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:18,859
shouldn't assume that we all experience

1041
00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:20,389
sentences in the same way the final

1042
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:22,960
reason I think we might be only

1043
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:24,909
scratching the surface of senses is

1044
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,319
something called the cognitive

1045
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:29,450
penetration theory and this goes back to

1046
00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:31,310
have a research that was done in the 40s

1047
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:34,040
and I think the most recently I've seen

1048
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:35,899
it reproduced is in 2007 it's also

1049
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:39,079
fairly unsettled though is it's really

1050
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:40,520
trippy so the cognitive penetration

1051
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,020
theory states that one's perceptual

1052
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,149
experience and the content of those

1053
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,918
perceptual experiences are influenced by

1054
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:49,368
your thoughts beliefs desires and other

1055
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,989
states of the cognitive system so for

1056
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:52,970
example one of the the types of research

1057
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:54,888
that comes out of the Center for the

1058
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:57,109
Study of perceptual experience in the

1059
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:58,609
University of Glasgow talks about this

1060
00:34:57,109 --> 00:35:01,160
experiment where they take paper that is

1061
00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:02,869
bright orange and then they cut it into

1062
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,730
a number of shapes and some of those

1063
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:06,530
shapes are things that we commonly

1064
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:09,200
associate with red like an apple or lips

1065
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:11,240
or a hard flaking on that stereotypical

1066
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,500
heart and then they would have a screen

1067
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,000
that would go up behind the test

1068
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,010
subjects we're in front of the test

1069
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,260
subjects sorry and it has a dial that

1070
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:20,030
goes from yellow to red and remember the

1071
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:22,819
papers Orange and so they're instructed

1072
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:24,470
to hold an object in front of the the

1073
00:35:22,819 --> 00:35:26,020
subject and then they have to turn the

1074
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:27,980
dial until it's indistinguishable

1075
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:29,420
indistinguishable between the two colors

1076
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,680
and when they would hold up an object

1077
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,660
that's traditionally red even though

1078
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,430
it's completely orange the person turns

1079
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,420
the dial until it was the back of the

1080
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:37,578
screen is red and they say it's

1081
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:39,560
indistinguishable now the thing that

1082
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:41,420
sucks about this is that once you know

1083
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,160
about it it doesn't work right so I've

1084
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,960
just ruined it for all of you I never

1085
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,770
get to try this experiment and that's

1086
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,210
why it's kind of contra

1087
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:49,340
because you can you can set these things

1088
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:51,740
up in a laboratory but you can't really

1089
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:53,270
test their effects very easily you can't

1090
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,240
set up an experiment in the real world

1091
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:58,040
for these things but if we come to learn

1092
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,180
about how we experience the world in

1093
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,830
these kinds of ways that actually really

1094
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,790
throws a lot of stuff off it kind of

1095
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:03,770
goes back to what I was saying about

1096
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:05,180
that french guy paranoia yeah that your

1097
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:07,850
social experience really affect how your

1098
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:10,399
senses work you might be even think

1099
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:11,360
about tasting expensive wine being a

1100
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,340
good example they've done a lot of

1101
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,560
studies on people being primed for that

1102
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:17,180
to taste better and also I can give you

1103
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,020
like an anecdotal evidence when I got my

1104
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,669
first magnet

1105
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,200
I was actually unlike a lot of grinders

1106
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,030
very patient and I didn't use it I

1107
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,919
waited for it to heal and then one day I

1108
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:26,510
woke up and I thought to myself today I

1109
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,119
you know I bet my nerves appealed I'm

1110
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:30,320
gonna see and so I had a fan beside my

1111
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,240
bed and I turned it around so it would

1112
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,250
blow the other way and I turned it on

1113
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,629
and I some reason I like retracted all

1114
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,070
my other fingers and I only hold the

1115
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:38,660
magnet finger up as if these were gonna

1116
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,490
interfere somehow it was look I just

1117
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:42,200
woken up so like give me a break

1118
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,939
but uh so I held them one finger up and

1119
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,618
I felt a breeze and I was like oh I only

1120
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,210
feel the breeze I guess it didn't it

1121
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:48,920
hasn't healed enough yet and then I

1122
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:50,090
realized well why am i holding other

1123
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,800
things and there was no breeze on the

1124
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:53,869
other fingers so I was kind of a you

1125
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,330
know cognitively primed to think that I

1126
00:36:53,869 --> 00:36:57,859
was going to feel a breeze but that was

1127
00:36:56,330 --> 00:37:01,759
actually the magnet vibrating but that's

1128
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:02,540
how my mind initially interpreted it so

1129
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,220
having looked at some of these

1130
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:06,800
biological material and social processes

1131
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:08,270
of post implantation I returns of the

1132
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,390
question is grinding worth it

1133
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:14,390
well I guess I really demand it depends

1134
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:16,009
on it worth to whom to die you know I I

1135
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:17,390
probably don't think so other people

1136
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:20,210
definitely disagree they think it's you

1137
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:21,618
know a very important thing to do and

1138
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,090
I've only really talked about magnets

1139
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:25,100
but this applies to any other sense that

1140
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:26,869
we're currently developing we have to

1141
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:29,150
get over the things we already know to

1142
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:31,580
find ways to know things that we didn't

1143
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:33,320
know were knowable so I mean that's what

1144
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,640
we're up against right it's not if you

1145
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,840
could even understand that sentence

1146
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,200
you're like halfway there probably

1147
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,460
because I don't and I wrote it soon so

1148
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,230
someone's going to die but I actually

1149
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,609
think it's important I don't think it's

1150
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,410
important enough to encourage people to

1151
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:50,000
get involved but I do encourage people

1152
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:51,770
to support it at least enough people die

1153
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,510
for cinnamon I guess so and it wasn't

1154
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:57,950
that worth it I don't know really so the

1155
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,710
distribution of the sense is ultimately

1156
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,390
a

1157
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,830
little question and so for it to be

1158
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,299
undertaken by grinders as opposed to

1159
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:05,040
private industry like what Cory Doctorow

1160
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,990
was talking about I think it's really

1161
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,339
important it's fun to engage in

1162
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:10,859
something that you haven't that hasn't

1163
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:12,450
been overtaken by regulation as well so

1164
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:14,160
yes you can die from but yes you could

1165
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:16,500
also die from over-regulation right if

1166
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,839
you live to 100 by regulating every

1167
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,369
aspect of your life to avoid risk I mean

1168
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:22,650
that to me is like a messed-up sense of

1169
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:25,020
time and you could put it so you can

1170
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:27,060
disagree with me it probably will but I

1171
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:29,940
guess my point is that senses don't

1172
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:31,290
happen all at once they happen it's a

1173
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,089
it's a historical question it's an

1174
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:34,950
instantaneous question it's also a

1175
00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:36,150
question of the future and alternative

1176
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:38,430
ways of trying to understand what

1177
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,960
actually we're trying to get it and I

1178
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:42,270
didn't get into any evolutionary stuff

1179
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,349
either so about how since it's developed

1180
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,820
so it's actually really really

1181
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:46,920
complicated now that's why I'm so

1182
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,390
excited about it that's all I have to

1183
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,070
say about that now we're going to take

1184
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:56,580
some questions if Jeff wants to come

1185
00:38:50,070 --> 00:39:07,339
back up right so what do you think of

1186
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:07,339
that thanks bird yes

1187
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,140
right

1188
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:34,509
oh yeah I mean I'm gonna have to give

1189
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:36,150
the same answer that a quarry doctor

1190
00:39:34,509 --> 00:39:39,640
gave when you predicted the future is a

1191
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:40,569
tricky business who knows what's gonna

1192
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,788
happen

1193
00:39:40,569 --> 00:39:44,109
it's like everything I mentioned him it

1194
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:45,819
may not pan out at all and nobody's

1195
00:39:44,109 --> 00:39:47,680
gonna care and rule I'll get magnets in

1196
00:39:45,819 --> 00:39:50,279
will do Bar tricks and that's that's

1197
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,999
where it ends I don't think so though

1198
00:39:50,279 --> 00:39:56,109
who knows because think about things

1199
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:57,759
don't think about if you don't think

1200
00:39:56,109 --> 00:39:59,200
what your senses are actual physical

1201
00:39:57,759 --> 00:40:01,569
things if you think of them more as a

1202
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,189
relationship to the world you think what

1203
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:04,749
the problems that you have now that are

1204
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:07,229
in sensible things you can't make sense

1205
00:40:04,749 --> 00:40:09,430
of so if you wanted to sense like a

1206
00:40:07,229 --> 00:40:11,859
really practical example would be like

1207
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:13,029
carbon dioxide leak you can't feel that

1208
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:14,348
but that's something that you know

1209
00:40:13,029 --> 00:40:22,420
threatens you because you live in a

1210
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:24,729
confined space maybe okay to plug

1211
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:27,279
dangerous things there the vevo key

1212
00:40:24,729 --> 00:40:29,828
that's coming out a sense of digital

1213
00:40:27,279 --> 00:40:32,170
identity once you start thinking about

1214
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:33,759
relationships to how you understand the

1215
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:37,509
world as a sense instead of you know

1216
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:39,309
appendages it actually opens up a lot of

1217
00:40:37,509 --> 00:40:40,779
a possibility for when you're thinking

1218
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:42,549
about sensory modification and future

1219
00:40:40,779 --> 00:40:44,249
projects so the VGO key if anybody

1220
00:40:42,549 --> 00:40:46,390
doesn't know it's like an encrypted

1221
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:47,738
implantable I don't even really know how

1222
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,249
to describe it can anybody do better to

1223
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:53,859
have than me

1224
00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:55,328
it's uh anybody yeah it's a two-factor

1225
00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:57,880
authentication key that you implant and

1226
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:59,890
it basically secures your digital self

1227
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,559
in your physical sense itself in a way

1228
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:04,690
that fingerprints can't or even optical

1229
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:06,309
scans can't so I think that's really

1230
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:08,710
promising and exciting it's like a

1231
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:11,670
really excellent practical example

1232
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,670
that's actually coming up soon

1233
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:34,670
yeah sure okay well yes and no oh oh

1234
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,980
sorry yeah he was saying would we

1235
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:38,690
consider you know externals like

1236
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,790
wearables to be you know the equivalent

1237
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:43,640
in terms of being like a enhancement of

1238
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:47,440
sensation right get that right okay yeah

1239
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:49,520
yeah I I really that's the thing is

1240
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,750
that's kind of a weird thing in grinding

1241
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,190
because there's you know we always kind

1242
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,330
of try to jump to the solution of

1243
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:55,970
putting it in your body just because

1244
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:57,980
that's you know so we do it but no I

1245
00:41:55,970 --> 00:42:00,049
mean that's actually the reason why I

1246
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:02,390
think that magnets and our kids are kind

1247
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,590
of so popular and you know a lot of the

1248
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:07,640
other stuff hasn't taken off as much as

1249
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:08,990
because of the fact that they need to be

1250
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,430
in your body I mean the point is is I

1251
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,569
you can't leave without your keys if

1252
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:13,069
they're implanted in your hand you know

1253
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,120
and the same with the magnets is we

1254
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:16,070
don't have anything that you can wear

1255
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,720
that's the equivalent of that you know I

1256
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:19,580
mean it really is dependent upon being

1257
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,980
implanted where is you know other senses

1258
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:24,290
things like I don't know you know the

1259
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:25,130
belts that due north and things like

1260
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,930
this or that kind of stuff

1261
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:29,570
oh no I mean that's totally that's

1262
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:32,509
totally valid and it doesn't necessarily

1263
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:35,210
need to be implanted so you know but

1264
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:35,930
it's the same thing and I yeah I mean I

1265
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:38,600
think it would have the same effect

1266
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:39,649
overall yeah I'll just add that those

1267
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,000
three points that I made at the end

1268
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,870
there about cognitive penetration and

1269
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,420
those sorts of things if they're

1270
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:45,620
implanted you can't do well maybe not

1271
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,400
you can't turn them off but if you don't

1272
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,109
turn them off and if they're

1273
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,150
continuously with continually with you

1274
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:51,470
if they become ubiquitous in your life I

1275
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,790
think that there's a lot more chance of

1276
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:55,310
discovering like the full extent of the

1277
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:56,540
potential and if you're just taking it

1278
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:58,250
off if it runs out of batteries and if

1279
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,690
you get bored of it and you put in a

1280
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:02,080
drawer obviously none of this is gonna

1281
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:02,080
happen

1282
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:40,880
um you know that's a question that I'm

1283
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,410
currently weighing out myself cuz the

1284
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,810
thing is is that when I first started

1285
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:47,060
doing procedures you know I didn't start

1286
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:47,600
from I'm a body mod address or a piercer

1287
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,490
or something

1288
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:52,819
I started from life I'm watching people

1289
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:54,109
on the internet you know showing doing

1290
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:56,480
procedures cutting their fingers open

1291
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:59,030
with like totally inappropriate tools in

1292
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,740
like a dirty kitchen you know and like

1293
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,670
seeing this I'm like I'll do that I mean

1294
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,689
you know I don't know how to do this but

1295
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,910
I'll tell you what that's not the right

1296
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:06,560
way and so you know I'd like to have

1297
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:08,629
this procedure done I'm not gonna pay

1298
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,790
like 500 bucks for somebody to do it cuz

1299
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:12,890
it's like I know it you know I know it

1300
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:14,779
can be done you know relatively easily

1301
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:17,180
so I started you know looking into doing

1302
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:20,120
it and now it's kind of um that's what

1303
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:21,799
I'm looking at it's really should it be

1304
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,839
done by someone who's you know a

1305
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,400
professional you know is it okay to do

1306
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,930
some of these procedures at home which

1307
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,370
ones are okay I mean when you think of

1308
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:30,200
like the art fed injections they're so

1309
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:31,640
simple I don't see a reason why someone

1310
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,290
wouldn't want to do an injection on

1311
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,540
themselves you know when you take out a

1312
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:37,190
scalpel then you know that starts

1313
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:40,160
getting to a point where now it's like

1314
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:41,750
you know I do I want to do this myself

1315
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,100
some people may feel comfortable you

1316
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,540
know and at that point it'd be like okay

1317
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,490
well let's talk about it and maybe I can

1318
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:47,990
give you some pointers if you're gonna

1319
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:50,330
do it anyways and I can stop you from

1320
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:51,680
maybe messing yourself up I don't know

1321
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:53,750
so the thing is is I mean I guess that's

1322
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,730
the thing is being acceptable to kind of

1323
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,690
be the broader you know people are doing

1324
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:58,040
this I don't think there's ever going to

1325
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:59,690
be a point where anybody at homes just

1326
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,640
like oh yeah we keep there you know our

1327
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:03,770
implantation kits over in the bathroom

1328
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,569
you know with the medicine cabinet and

1329
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:06,620
go ahead and catch yourself up dude you

1330
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:09,860
know I don't think we're gonna ever

1331
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:11,000
really get to that point but you know I

1332
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,590
don't know it's it's a weird thing

1333
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,780
because you know the difference being

1334
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:16,220
talking about robotics being accessible

1335
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,200
and stuff like that is you usually

1336
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:21,859
aren't dying from robotics if you mess

1337
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:23,569
up you know where is it can be dangerous

1338
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:25,370
and of course death I'm going to the

1339
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:27,650
most extreme more likely it's gonna be

1340
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:29,359
you know you end up losing a finger or

1341
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:32,090
you end up with a nasty infection or you

1342
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:33,500
know you give you know a hepatitis B to

1343
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:34,850
your buddy or something you know it's

1344
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,380
like I mean those are horrible things

1345
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:40,190
but it's like you know these these are

1346
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:41,630
large risks you know so I mean it's kind

1347
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:43,100
of I'm still kind of weighing that out

1348
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:45,350
you know this should should it be

1349
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,220
exclusively people who are professionals

1350
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:48,319
and trained and

1351
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:50,450
and you know really know what they're

1352
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:53,660
doing or is it okay to work on yourself

1353
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:55,220
I don't know I mean I started as a Schmo

1354
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:57,470
didn't know anything and I do a lot of

1355
00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:00,259
procedures now so I don't know I mean

1356
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:01,790
like if I hadn't you know gone on the

1357
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:03,170
route to try to do it but I don't know

1358
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:07,120
what's the normal pathway to get there

1359
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:07,120
you know before you are okay to do it

1360
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:25,690
well I I people have done the the gluing

1361
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:27,190
a magnet to your fingers have heard or

1362
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,810
to your fingernail I've actually never

1363
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:31,750
tried it so I don't think that can make

1364
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:34,150
it a full honest appraisal of that but

1365
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:35,800
in your finger I assume and from what

1366
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:37,030
I've heard from other people it's quite

1367
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,430
a bit more sensitive once it's under

1368
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:42,220
your skin as far as other reasons to do

1369
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:43,600
is measuring biometrics it's a lot

1370
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:48,490
different under the skin then above the

1371
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:51,850
skin I don't yeah I mean I guess another

1372
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:53,109
example yeah yeah I mean you Vic witness

1373
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:55,450
trying to find sex or things being

1374
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:57,490
surprised if you're into it for the the

1375
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:59,919
exploration of a city I mean Pokemon go

1376
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:01,120
is really popular for a minute there and

1377
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,170
this is basically like that you go

1378
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,970
somewhere then all of sudden like

1379
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:06,460
yesterday I found out that American

1380
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:08,200
change is not magnetic and Canadian

1381
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:10,390
changes so I kind of do a half my bar

1382
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:13,330
tricks now it sucks going back to Canada

1383
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:15,160
tomorrow make some money at the bar just

1384
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,330
make some beer but like the discovery is

1385
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:19,120
part of it sorry to interrupt you there

1386
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:21,040
oh yeah and I don't think it is just

1387
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:23,770
like for example with the with the like

1388
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,050
NFC's for example like I have my work

1389
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:27,820
badge online so you know I work at a

1390
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,900
hospital so everything is everything is

1391
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,340
connected to your badge you know it's

1392
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,110
like every door you go through every

1393
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,270
every place you go you know pulling meds

1394
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:37,030
doing whatever it's just really simple

1395
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:38,590
to use I mean that that isn't something

1396
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:40,450
that it's really it's a great

1397
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:42,010
convenience that a wearable said well I

1398
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:43,390
have two water bullets here it's a badge

1399
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:45,130
and hey you know I could use it but I

1400
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:46,750
actually end up using my hand a lot more

1401
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:48,220
and I think with the magnets like he was

1402
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:50,290
saying it's if it was something you to

1403
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:52,149
wear or think about you wouldn't

1404
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:53,380
necessarily use it where is I commonly

1405
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:55,000
with magnets it's like you run into the

1406
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,310
oh whoa what was that you know and it's

1407
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,050
it ends up just occurring when you're

1408
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:01,960
not expecting it most and that's when

1409
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:03,460
it's kind of a lot of fun I think going

1410
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,260
back to the convenience thing to it's

1411
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:07,180
convenient for particular kinds of

1412
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,800
people so our fits for him makes a lot

1413
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,870
of sense but I'm basically homeless and

1414
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,550
I live in a car and I trade that car in

1415
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,170
every couple years for something else so

1416
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:16,240
I'm not gonna go all the trouble of

1417
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:18,250
fixing up my car you know unlock it I

1418
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,959
don't have like a I'm not especially

1419
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,970
gainfully employed I work for a

1420
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,050
university but they don't have like up

1421
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:24,910
in Canada we don't really use that as

1422
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:26,770
much as they do put in Silicon Valley

1423
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:28,240
for example so it's it's not worth it

1424
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:31,410
for me some things are going to be good

1425
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,410
for some people some things aren't

1426
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:35,820
who's next

1427
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:45,650
oh um actually I was using a default

1428
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:49,880
solution it's usually 70% alcohol

1429
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:53,990
I believe it's 70% alcohol with actually

1430
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:57,680
I have it in my notes throw yours over

1431
00:48:53,990 --> 00:49:00,430
that I think was 2% or exiting gluconate

1432
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,430
let me double-check

1433
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:17,839
here we go oh it was 70% alcohol with 2%

1434
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:19,519
clerics named gluconate

1435
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:21,199
yeah that's but that's um usually when

1436
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:22,968
you buy it that is the percentages they

1437
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:25,039
go in you know and I you know I got

1438
00:49:22,969 --> 00:49:28,729
really detailed on these things and in

1439
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:30,859
reality it's the point of the of being

1440
00:49:28,729 --> 00:49:32,448
so detailed was not to bore you but

1441
00:49:30,859 --> 00:49:34,098
rather to try to point out that it's

1442
00:49:32,449 --> 00:49:36,169
like there is quite a bit to this you

1443
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:38,899
know there are other percentages there's

1444
00:49:36,169 --> 00:49:40,609
higher percentages for example if you go

1445
00:49:38,899 --> 00:49:42,229
to an O R now a lot of the hand

1446
00:49:40,609 --> 00:49:44,328
scrubbing and stuff that like you know

1447
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:45,678
I've really been advocating for and like

1448
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:46,999
having people in the community like ask

1449
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:48,619
five had minutes man you got to do it

1450
00:49:46,999 --> 00:49:50,479
this with it and turns out now they had

1451
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:52,069
like a really strong version of

1452
00:49:50,479 --> 00:49:54,589
chlorhexidine so the surgeons are like

1453
00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:56,058
walking in and just like that's it you

1454
00:49:54,589 --> 00:49:58,149
know it's like that's the that's the new

1455
00:49:56,059 --> 00:50:01,149
version of the hand scrub you know so I

1456
00:49:58,149 --> 00:50:01,149
yeah

1457
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,030
mm-hmm

1458
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:45,200
oh yeah it goes in front of you there

1459
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:47,840
it's multiple yeah yeah well okay so uh

1460
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,430
you probably read about richly richly is

1461
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:52,610
the guy who had the magnet implants put

1462
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:54,350
into his uh into his ears he's in the

1463
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:56,900
other room right now unsalted he didn't

1464
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:59,120
come in here no but no originally I had

1465
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,050
a magnet there tragus implants and they

1466
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,180
vibrate

1467
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:03,590
I think he's last night he was even

1468
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,870
talking about him where he is

1469
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:08,120
relatively happy with them I think that

1470
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:09,259
he said that he would like the volume to

1471
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,430
be a little higher and he strayed a

1472
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:12,410
tweak to find a way to make that happen

1473
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:13,609
there's a number of the other people

1474
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:15,529
who've gone at though who said they're

1475
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:17,900
they're very happy with with a volume of

1476
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:19,400
it ok and then that of course is like a

1477
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,260
passive thing you don't have any

1478
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,550
circuitry or anything it's really a coil

1479
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:27,040
that you're wearing that's driving him

1480
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:32,900
whereas uh Ben BZ he's been working on

1481
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:34,580
what's the name for it yeah you know

1482
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:36,560
which is essentially is a Bluetooth

1483
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:38,600
right it's bluetooth can interact

1484
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,670
directly with your phone you know and it

1485
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,990
would be implanted under the skin it's

1486
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:44,270
you know rechargeable through the skin

1487
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:46,790
using an induction charging and and all

1488
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:48,950
that fun so now in terms of the bone

1489
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:51,140
conduction that one's a bit kind of

1490
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:53,509
weird point on it and this is where as

1491
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:55,819
I'm like you know building up my space

1492
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,810
and I'm like doing more projects you

1493
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,520
know I'm trying to figure out where I

1494
00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:01,220
want to draw the line yeah

1495
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,840
because uh you know anything under the

1496
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:04,580
skin doing subdermal stuff it's like ah

1497
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,690
that's relatively easy you know when you

1498
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,910
start talking about getting into bone

1499
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:09,530
though that's where I'm kind of you want

1500
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:11,330
to cross this line because it's not a

1501
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:12,860
normal generally endeavor you do with

1502
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:15,259
piercing and the risks are entirely

1503
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:17,540
different and your start going up there

1504
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:19,580
so you know while uh Ben's you know it

1505
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,930
actually would vibrate even through the

1506
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:22,670
skin if you held it up as opposed to

1507
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:25,430
being whatever it you're getting the

1508
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:27,170
same eye same results as bone conduction

1509
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:31,120
be but it's not gonna be the same as if

1510
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:33,740
you actually had a what are they called

1511
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:35,180
the basically the hearing aid thing with

1512
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,680
the bone conduction system that sits

1513
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,879
outside I forget the name off the top of

1514
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,330
my head but I mean that actually is

1515
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,370
drilled

1516
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:41,600
yeah cochlear implant as I'm thinking up

1517
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:44,270
and yeah I mean that's actually is

1518
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,620
directly into bone and it comes with

1519
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:46,880
certain risks you know and I I

1520
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,470
personally wouldn't feel comfortable

1521
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,210
dealing into someone's head like that

1522
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:51,720
you know I think that's usually

1523
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:54,780
proprietary stuff to you

1524
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:56,220
from what I've heard oh there was

1525
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:59,300
another question over here earlier I

1526
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:59,299
don't know if it still exists

1527
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:08,009
true

1528
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,900
mmm

1529
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:47,390
sure oh yeah and that's that's largely

1530
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,220
what the government tried to do in that

1531
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:51,618
case that I was talking about with the

1532
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:56,149
suicide on Baffin Island but at the same

1533
00:53:51,619 --> 00:53:58,309
time you can think about try to imagine

1534
00:53:56,150 --> 00:54:00,589
a world where the time is considered as

1535
00:53:58,309 --> 00:54:02,690
now or not now I find that incredibly

1536
00:54:00,589 --> 00:54:04,220
difficult to undertake conceive of a

1537
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:07,099
world where there is no future because I

1538
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:08,868
haven't thought of it yet and it's

1539
00:54:07,099 --> 00:54:11,559
really difficult to change the way you

1540
00:54:08,869 --> 00:54:21,160
think about things that have been

1541
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:21,160
normalized in your body pardon me

1542
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,019
so you have the words for them is what

1543
00:54:32,779 --> 00:54:35,019
you're saying

1544
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,299
right

1545
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,730
yes

1546
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,899
mm-hm

1547
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:13,899
I agree that it sounds it sounds that

1548
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:17,680
that it should be that simple but in

1549
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:20,349
practice from decades of cognitive

1550
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,879
linguistic anthropology it's hard I'm

1551
00:55:20,349 --> 00:55:26,760
not but you're right you're right it is

1552
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:26,760
you're right but it's just not that easy

1553
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:31,150
according to the literature and it is

1554
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:32,410
controversial and I'm not a linguistic

1555
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:35,170
anthropologist so I'm not gonna argue

1556
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:36,279
because you have no idea I mean I've

1557
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:38,050
read the literature I know what they say

1558
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:40,890
I'm just telling you what they would

1559
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:40,890
argue yes please

1560
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:11,450
um no really I'm interested ya know it's

1561
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:13,550
uh you got to think it's it's

1562
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:16,279
interesting that some of this you've got

1563
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:18,950
to think is also I want to put it okay

1564
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:20,660
so for example grindhouse Brian house is

1565
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:23,029
coming out with like their v2 which does

1566
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:24,890
all kinds of amazing things with gesture

1567
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:27,140
recognition and interaction writer but

1568
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:28,640
their v1 of the North Star it was

1569
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,540
specifically lights its lights that

1570
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,549
shine through your skin this is an

1571
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:33,110
aesthetic project you know their first

1572
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:34,880
one was an aesthetic project so when you

1573
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:36,560
think about it it's part of this I think

1574
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,710
is that kind of it's almost like getting

1575
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:41,630
a tattoo you know so you know some of

1576
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:43,790
this stuff the point of it really is in

1577
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:46,580
and of itself to have the process occur

1578
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:47,810
and to have this as the end result you

1579
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:49,910
know for some people it's going to be

1580
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:51,440
the end result is trying to gain an

1581
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:53,390
ability the end result is going to be

1582
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,920
trying to you know achieve these senses

1583
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:56,810
and it doesn't really matter how for

1584
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,910
other people it's you know I like this

1585
00:56:56,810 --> 00:57:00,920
process and I'm doing this thing so you

1586
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:02,359
know it's yeah I agree they do have I

1587
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,070
mean you could probably make something

1588
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:06,410
like a ring the vibrates using a

1589
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:08,150
vibration motor and tie it into devices

1590
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:09,830
and you get you know a very similar

1591
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:11,780
effect you could definitely have some

1592
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:14,270
some system to do that I'm not saying

1593
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:16,250
that I that wouldn't be useful I'm not

1594
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:19,400
saying that it's not something worth

1595
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:21,650
pursuing for someone but it's just not

1596
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,630
the it's not the direction like I'm

1597
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:25,520
personally it's it's I'm not looking for

1598
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:28,310
a simple way to do this it's like you

1599
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:31,340
know I'm I'm interested in kind of the

1600
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:33,170
biohack can we integrate technology into

1601
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:36,830
the body type of solution you know there

1602
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:39,380
are other ways for example on the other

1603
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:40,730
hand apparently Disney is patenting this

1604
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:43,490
thing that I don't know how it works at

1605
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:45,200
all magic Disney magic but you can touch

1606
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:46,279
something and advice sending electricity

1607
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,810
through it they can make you feel

1608
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:50,690
different things even though the actual

1609
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:52,250
surface is flat and so if something like

1610
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:54,830
that comes out yeah it completely

1611
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:56,120
undermines a lot of projects and you

1612
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:57,009
wouldn't need to cut yourself open and

1613
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:59,089
that's awesome

1614
00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:00,770
that's great I mean there's something

1615
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:01,970
better comes out then use that if you

1616
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:05,680
don't have to cut yourself open it don't

1617
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:05,680
cut yourself open that'd be great

1618
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:45,960
yeah well okay so a lot of the stuff

1619
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:47,190
that we've been working on is stepping

1620
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,810
stones yes so you think about the

1621
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,090
magnets like he was saying a lot of it

1622
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:52,140
is that we're actually working on

1623
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:54,000
biocompatible coatings and you know

1624
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:56,040
having a slew of biocompatible coatings

1625
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,020
that work with different devices and the

1626
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,400
end goal would be having some kind of

1627
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:00,990
interface I mean we're looking at

1628
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,990
interfacing the nervous system with

1629
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:06,000
devices right and you know really

1630
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:09,180
something like going to the head EKG I'm

1631
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,310
sorry EEG work and such it's relatively

1632
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:13,040
limited because of how much noise you

1633
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:15,000
have compared to trying to isolate

1634
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:17,580
signals and whatnot but in peripheral

1635
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,360
nervous system is relatively simple and

1636
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:24,090
you know you need things like you know

1637
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:25,440
I'm thinking of who get the implant for

1638
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:29,120
work yeah I'm thinking we're weak you

1639
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,120
know things like we're we going to the

1640
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:34,020
but uh you know and being able to

1641
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:35,400
interface with the nervous system

1642
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:38,640
essentially this is this is kind of the

1643
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:40,800
direction we're moving towards right so

1644
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,589
although you know magnets they're you

1645
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:45,240
know it's a it's a novelty right but I

1646
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:46,200
think that you're not gonna be able to

1647
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,879
find if you could find a way to

1648
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,290
interface with your with your nervous

1649
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,820
system without actually having an

1650
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:52,320
implant or something that's great I

1651
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:54,450
don't I don't personally see that

1652
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:56,220
happening so I'm part of what we're

1653
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:58,439
doing is just kind of building up all of

1654
00:59:56,220 --> 01:00:00,060
our techniques and building up our

1655
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,530
knowledge base in order to have these

1656
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:04,410
larger projects that really will make a

1657
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:07,080
difference because I mean really magnets

1658
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:08,549
and our feeds are not it's not an

1659
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:11,220
amazing thing it's not like it's really

1660
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:13,080
gonna have some once again huge sweeping

1661
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:14,790
social change yeah but once you get to

1662
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:16,740
something where you're actually having

1663
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:18,600
direct send a nervous system interface

1664
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:20,250
with computers that's that's a whole

1665
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:22,410
different thing and who's gonna work on

1666
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:25,380
it it's a question because you know you

1667
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:26,730
don't have Google working on a project

1668
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:28,230
like this because the liability

1669
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:29,820
associated with doing these types of

1670
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:31,110
procedures you know Google's not gonna

1671
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:33,870
drill into someone's head and start

1672
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:36,420
putting in implants you know I mean

1673
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:38,069
there's just so much here the entire the

1674
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:40,590
way the medical system works is you know

1675
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:43,070
we don't our medical system in the US

1676
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:45,450
has no interest in making people better

1677
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:47,970
okay because you know any procedure

1678
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:51,750
comes with risk and they weigh out the

1679
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:53,169
amount of risk versus the amount of

1680
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:55,059
benefit in terms of maintained

1681
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:57,190
someone at what's considered a baseline

1682
01:00:55,059 --> 01:00:58,900
human right so you know they're not

1683
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:01,030
gonna prescribe you modafinil because

1684
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,470
you want to be smarter because there's a

1685
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:04,030
risk dude you could die I'm not gonna

1686
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:05,859
risk my license prescribing you this

1687
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:09,010
crap so that you can stay up and you

1688
01:01:05,859 --> 01:01:11,040
know right next you know study more for

1689
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:13,329
your tests or whatever you know it's

1690
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,558
really they cut it off at that line of

1691
01:01:13,329 --> 01:01:16,540
work we're trying to maintain you at

1692
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,250
standard human whereas what grinders

1693
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:21,099
trying to push past that and willing to

1694
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:22,780
take on the the risk I think really

1695
01:01:21,099 --> 01:01:23,430
that's what we need in order to get

1696
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:27,059
there

1697
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:29,649
there's just the way the system is built

1698
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:33,180
corporations and such they're blocked

1699
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:33,180
from kind of pursuing this I think

1700
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:53,670
you also put all the coatings I mean the

1701
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:58,360
are you talking coatings or devices okay

1702
01:01:53,670 --> 01:02:00,730
list it's hard to say because a lot of

1703
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:04,780
them are pipe dreams if you want

1704
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:05,770
actually produce things you probably be

1705
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:06,360
better off talking anybody from

1706
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:08,590
grindhouse

1707
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:11,950
talking to Ben they're in the second row

1708
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:13,180
here I could list things off but they'll

1709
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:16,649
be able to give you way more details

1710
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:20,350
about its various kinds of interactive

1711
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:22,390
sensory things that's the worst answer

1712
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:24,430
it various kinds of interactions okay a

1713
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:26,589
list of things that free exist how about

1714
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:28,660
that so you have for example the the

1715
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:31,290
North Star which is an implant you can

1716
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:35,980
talk to if you'd like to see some in

1717
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:37,300
vitro I don't know hey there you go the

1718
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:39,520
the newer version actually does

1719
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:42,970
interphase wirelessly it doesn't you

1720
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:47,710
gesture recognition right now right no

1721
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:49,419
but like version two is done there you

1722
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:51,310
go another good person to talk to you

1723
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:52,540
yeah and so that's a real thing being in

1724
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:54,549
planet that's done and it's far more

1725
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:56,890
invasive than a magnet you know but

1726
01:02:54,550 --> 01:03:00,010
there's also what are they fireflies

1727
01:02:56,890 --> 01:03:04,240
which are essentially tritium filled

1728
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:07,690
vials that are they're actually what is

1729
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:09,700
it they have well they're basically

1730
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:11,350
shielded so that you're not getting a

1731
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:13,569
dose of radiation or a significant dose

1732
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:14,920
of radiation but it can be implanted and

1733
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:16,300
actually shines through so if you had a

1734
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,160
tattoo or whatnot you're gonna have

1735
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:21,130
light shining through also hey we got a

1736
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:24,339
one down here yeah that's true yeah I

1737
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:26,710
know it's it's not hot it's a it's good

1738
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:28,120
yeah it's it's not bad it's like an

1739
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:31,120
x-ray everyday that actually opens up

1740
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:32,170
this stuff for backlit LCD displays

1741
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,970
under the skin and I know someone

1742
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:35,170
working on that as well yeah that you

1743
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:36,490
wouldn't have to have a battery in it

1744
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:38,170
because it's the tritium lining it up

1745
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:39,490
you would still need a battery for the

1746
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:40,780
other part but the light is the part

1747
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:43,509
that scoffers are gonna take a lot of

1748
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:46,990
energy of course there's a number of

1749
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:49,120
variants on the magnet thing there's the

1750
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:51,189
bottle nose which essentially extends

1751
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:53,319
the use of magnets magnets pencils not

1752
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:55,210
really that useful but when you can wear

1753
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:57,760
something that is essentially

1754
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:59,440
transmitting a magnetic field and it's

1755
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,780
telling you about for example maybe

1756
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,520
ambient radiation or pressure or

1757
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:05,170
anything you would want to sense you

1758
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:08,530
know you can actually wear a device that

1759
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:10,660
is going to transmit to your back that

1760
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:12,790
and then you can be picking up that

1761
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:15,520
sense which you know extends the utility

1762
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:17,050
of magnets quite a bit what else exists

1763
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:19,119
another project I'm really excited about

1764
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:22,089
that has kind of been delayed quite a

1765
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:23,319
bit is a Deadman switch where it is just

1766
01:04:22,089 --> 01:04:24,609
measuring whether you're alive and if

1767
01:04:23,319 --> 01:04:26,319
you're not it sends out a message to

1768
01:04:24,609 --> 01:04:27,819
delete your emails and whatever else

1769
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:29,470
that you don't want to have around when

1770
01:04:27,819 --> 01:04:31,329
you're dead which i think is a really

1771
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:32,828
good idea it's really important for like

1772
01:04:31,329 --> 01:04:36,400
political activism and that kind of

1773
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:37,839
thing it's a it's really important no

1774
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,460
problem there's other ones too I just

1775
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:46,150
off the top mine there's a lot of stuff

1776
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:49,720
yeah oh I love Tron the look yeah I have

1777
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:53,230
his card right here is from richly he is

1778
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:58,689
the CEO of cyborg as mix and it's an

1779
01:04:53,230 --> 01:05:03,190
implantable in a vibration device yeah

1780
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:07,030
oh yeah and then it been also had a big

1781
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:17,310
part in that so don't forget been sorry

1782
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:17,310
then I was just reading the card yeah

1783
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:30,910
like transdermal 'he's

1784
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:35,660
I

1785
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:45,610
you know what I've done implants right

1786
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:47,650
implanted like a USB memory stick hub

1787
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:49,390
thing and this and that you know it's

1788
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:51,940
doable the thing that's gonna push it is

1789
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:56,440
actually there was some new technology

1790
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:58,270
that's come out regarding what is it

1791
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,550
called essentially a prosthetics right

1792
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:02,830
most prosthetics kind of suck to wear

1793
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:04,960
because of the way it interfaces with

1794
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:06,130
you know your leg or whatever you're

1795
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,630
wearing and now they've come up with a

1796
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:09,340
new design that passes through the skin

1797
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,620
it can be bound directly to bone and

1798
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:13,960
it's kind of like a porous titanium with

1799
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:15,520
I don't know off the top of my head the

1800
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:17,200
material but it's it's coated with the

1801
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:19,030
material essentially that a bone can

1802
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,740
interweave with you know hard reason

1803
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:21,970
what not can move in it actually it's

1804
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:24,850
good enough that you can passage the

1805
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:26,410
skin and the skin will bond in that area

1806
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:27,970
to where you no longer have this being a

1807
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:29,620
risk of infection so you have people

1808
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:31,689
that are you know significantly better

1809
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:33,609
results from their prosthetics because

1810
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:36,040
it's it's like an extension of them you

1811
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:37,390
know and based off of this it's the same

1812
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:39,009
concept if you wanted something that's

1813
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:40,870
actually is gonna be transdermal you

1814
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:42,760
know you wanted something to to be able

1815
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:44,560
to hey look I'm gonna plug into myself

1816
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:46,330
and do this and this it's doable there's

1817
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:49,120
a guy he actually we spoke here last

1818
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:51,370
year it's remember his real name but

1819
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:53,259
it's chironex I'm Justin Justin yeah he

1820
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:55,299
spoke here apparently last year and he's

1821
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:57,130
done some experiments with this too

1822
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:58,870
where he coded a few things with this

1823
01:06:57,130 --> 01:07:00,970
material to see how they bind you know

1824
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:02,290
and that's that once again gets back

1825
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:03,819
into this whole thing of like we talked

1826
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:05,290
about coatings and it's like that's a

1827
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:07,330
huge topic because you know for example

1828
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:08,950
that coating it's great for the

1829
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:11,230
application of having something that's a

1830
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:12,759
transdermal you know very specific with

1831
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:14,680
a lot of other stuff you don't want your

1832
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:16,680
you don't want your tissue to bind to it

1833
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:19,120
you know if I have you know for example

1834
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:20,919
you know some of these other implants

1835
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:22,720
you know I've had to switch out implants

1836
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,250
on people and do some stuff you don't

1837
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,509
want adhesion it really makes it

1838
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:27,970
terribly and sometimes you're gonna have

1839
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:29,650
to take a you know a tool and actually

1840
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:32,140
had to work around and break off all the

1841
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:33,730
adhesion of tissue bound to this implant

1842
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:35,379
you know so in that case you want

1843
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:37,360
something the different coating you know

1844
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:38,980
that has actually a major part of the

1845
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:41,050
stuff people are working on is is not

1846
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:43,660
only building the devices but you know

1847
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:46,150
finding an appropriate way to shape the

1848
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:47,529
devices and coat the devices and there's

1849
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:49,300
a lot to it with that that's you know

1850
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:50,770
definitely a big issue how many

1851
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:52,140
different ways have you tried to code a

1852
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:55,660
vibrating

1853
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:56,680
like the the Bluetooth headset oh yeah

1854
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:58,149
because you need something that moves

1855
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:06,460
but you also need something that doesn't

1856
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:10,259
move so yeah so it takes a while yeah a

1857
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:10,259
lot of trial and error in the back

1858
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:28,990
Oh screw things like MRIs yeah okay I

1859
01:08:22,779 --> 01:08:30,759
went into an MRI with an M 3031 it can

1860
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:33,460
be painful you get real close to it and

1861
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:34,990
man it hurts but if let's say you had to

1862
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:37,330
get an MRI if you wrapped your finger

1863
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:38,469
with a piece of tape you should be okay

1864
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:41,229
I mean it's not gonna pull out of the

1865
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:43,690
skin it will apply a lot of pressure and

1866
01:08:41,229 --> 01:08:45,549
I kind of heard that said another person

1867
01:08:43,689 --> 01:08:47,229
I work with who had a magnet went in and

1868
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:49,120
was working with a patient the MRI and I

1869
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:53,019
had to cut her magnet out later it

1870
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:57,220
somehow caused a breach in the coating

1871
01:08:53,020 --> 01:09:00,010
and ended up causing rejection so in

1872
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:02,010
terms of the MRI itself since the

1873
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:04,750
locations were doing at doing it to that

1874
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:05,859
you know you're gonna lose resolution in

1875
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:07,600
that area so if you were getting

1876
01:09:05,859 --> 01:09:09,910
specifically an MRI of your finger and

1877
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,080
you did a high-resolution it's that but

1878
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:13,569
I mean really how often does that happen

1879
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:18,490
I'm moody MRIs of the head we do MRIs of

1880
01:09:13,569 --> 01:09:19,899
you know abdomen and yeah so it's a

1881
01:09:18,490 --> 01:09:22,510
question of lifestyle like I was saying

1882
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:23,979
I know a couple people that they're a

1883
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:25,450
couple and they wanted to get the so

1884
01:09:23,979 --> 01:09:26,769
called lovers magnets where they get one

1885
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:28,599
kind of in their hands and were thinking

1886
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:29,980
hold on and they're really attracted to

1887
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:32,470
each other that's the pun and it's funny

1888
01:09:29,979 --> 01:09:33,939
and whatever but like before they did it

1889
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:35,620
he went skateboarding and fell down and

1890
01:09:33,939 --> 01:09:37,059
scraped off his whole hand usually wait

1891
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:39,099
a second it's probably not a good spot

1892
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:44,020
given that I skateboard a lot it's gonna

1893
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:47,850
come up pretty much immediately any

1894
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:47,850
other questions yes

1895
01:09:55,659 --> 01:10:01,059
it's really cool DARPA has a paper that

1896
01:09:57,790 --> 01:10:04,290
was written like and I think it was 2010

1897
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:04,290
or something where they're talking about

1898
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:08,259
basically talking about some of these

1899
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:09,670
things and things that they could do in

1900
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:11,560
terms of you know how useful there's a

1901
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:13,300
try to personally enhanced soldiers with

1902
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:17,290
either you know implantable technology

1903
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:18,730
or nootropics or whatnot and really the

1904
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:20,920
conclusion of the paper was you know

1905
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:22,780
watch what people are doing and not just

1906
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,949
industry and watch like the individuals

1907
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:25,780
because somebody's gonna come up with

1908
01:10:23,949 --> 01:10:27,190
something interesting and then you go to

1909
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:29,920
DEFCON and they're like all over the

1910
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:32,019
biohack village just like yeah it's a it

1911
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:34,139
was really interesting um you know I

1912
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:37,630
don't think it's something like they

1913
01:10:34,139 --> 01:10:39,190
aren't interested or that you know

1914
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:40,630
they're like you know they can't see the

1915
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:43,089
potential that we see or something I

1916
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:45,070
just don't know how they could legally

1917
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:48,340
get away with these things you know

1918
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:49,509
there's just so much to it to where you

1919
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:52,719
know I mean essentially you're getting

1920
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:56,380
into human experimentation you're and

1921
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:58,570
it's not with an end in mind that has to

1922
01:10:56,380 --> 01:11:00,190
do with healing or curing someone you

1923
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:01,449
know so if when you're saying like you

1924
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:03,759
know hey we want to be able to have this

1925
01:11:01,449 --> 01:11:06,610
person have this cool feature or

1926
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:08,860
whatever you're not curing them and if

1927
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:11,739
it goes wrong and they could die so how

1928
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:13,269
do you justify this you know I just not

1929
01:11:11,739 --> 01:11:14,589
set up I mean it's just something that

1930
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:16,469
hasn't been addressed there's no leeway

1931
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:22,110
for that at this point I just don't

1932
01:11:16,469 --> 01:11:22,110
think that there's a path for them

1933
01:11:56,190 --> 01:12:00,530
like the actual infrared device under

1934
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:00,530
the skin you may

1935
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:18,519
yeah I don't know anybody working on

1936
01:12:16,389 --> 01:12:22,110
that specifically but there is Tim foot

1937
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:22,110
has had a course template assigned up

1938
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:53,220
right

1939
01:13:04,119 --> 01:13:06,629
your body

1940
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:21,110
any other questions I don't even know

1941
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:31,280
who to look to you for when we're cut

1942
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:35,889
off for time either oh thanks

1943
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:35,889
[Applause]
