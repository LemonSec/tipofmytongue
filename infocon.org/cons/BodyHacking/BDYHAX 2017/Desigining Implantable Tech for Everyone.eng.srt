1
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,570
how's it going everyone this is this

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,100
panel is designing implantable tech for

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,020
everyone we're gonna be discussing

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,720
designing and building implants and

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:22,029
testing for safety of these devices I'm

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,220
Jeffery Tibbets and I'm moderating this

7
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:26,980
is amol Groff stuff Malgosia

00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,450
is a founder of dangerous things company

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,239
that markets implantable texts such as

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,920
the Flex NT and the Flex DF which are

11
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,880
high-performance NFC transponders

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,770
encased in a flexible biopolymer next we

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,390
have Ryan Shay Ryan O'Shea is

14

collaborative responsible to projects

16
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,599
such as the circadian and implantable

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,949
which collects biomedical data and the

bottlenose a wearable which interacts

19
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:52,149
with compl anted magnets and we have

Alex Smith founder of cyber ëismí cyber

21
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:56,170
Esme provides products such as a

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,940
subdermal temperature sensor and the

23
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,640
Firefly an implant which emits light to

24
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,920
the skin all right well my first

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,300
question is why are you involved in bio

26
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:10,270
hacking well me personally because I was

27
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,550
lazy I I wanted to get rid of my keys

28
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,020
and going through this door constantly

29
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,149
was really annoying and I wanted the

30
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,710
door to just know that was me I looked

31
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:19,390
at like fingerprint scanners and iris

32
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,250
scanners and it was kind of clunky and

33
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:24,100
still is today but not really

34
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,329
well-suited for outdoors so the expense

35
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,179
of everything I just didn't wanna do so

36
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:30,008
RFID seemed like the best way to go but

37
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,920
trading a key for a card wasn't solving

38
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:35,500
the problem and I looked at pets doing

39
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,219
in this implants for decades and I was

40
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,530
like yeah let's do that

41
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:40,899
wait it was kind of a no-brainer and so

42
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:45,460
I did that and then kind of everybody

43
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:49,630
freaked out and like yeah well when was

44
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:52,179
that first those 2005 I think I've

45
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:54,280
always been a transhumanist I guess I

46
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,200
just never knew that vocabulary and that

47
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,549
it was an actual thing that existed

48
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,899
because I always thought that science

49
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:01,240
and technology would be used to overcome

50
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:02,710
human limitations just something just as

51
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,689
we've been using it for thousands of

52
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,130
years already and I I knew that this

53
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:08,019
future was coming and then when I saw

54
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,179
things being posted that people were

55
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,370
doing this I definitely just dived right

56
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:14,260
into the industry and I self-identify as

57
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,730
a biohacker and a transhumanist now

58
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,649
because I think now that I have the

59
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,530
vocabulary to describe that and that I

60
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,970
first found out about it probably around

61
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,890
2013 so I've been in the community for

62
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,540
for for you

63
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,700
is now working away but I've always had

64
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,929
that passion for futurism in science and

65
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,239
technology so for me basically I read

66
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,280
too much science fiction as a child

67
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,010
wanted to be a cyborg and this is the

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,240
closest thing I could get I originally

69
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,190
started getting other peoples implants

70
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,840
and then like hit the limit of what was

71
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,060
available and I'm like I want something

72
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,100
more so I had to play with myself and

73
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,630
once you put one thing in study it

74
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,920
snowballing in you know you made other

75
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,750
people want what I was building so

76
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,140
mm-hmm make it available to them too

77
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,520
yeah okay well how far do you see these

78
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,109
kinds of implants going in the next

79
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,190
thirty years now this is like I was

80
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,180
saying I have some of these you know

81
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,670
this is kind of an interpretable

82
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,200
question you know by far I mean what

83
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,208
kind of both how far is it going to

84
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,829
encroach into society and how far in

85
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,080
terms of being technologically advanced

86
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,810
yeah yeah so thirty years is quite a

87
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,300
span yeah I think it'll be ubiquitous I

88
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,459
think the current wearables craze which

89
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,890
is starting to die down I mean you know

90
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,810
Google's Samsung's and the companies of

91
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,059
that era are are going to definitely

92
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,570
have these these you know human

93
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,010
enhancement implants and so you know

94
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,900
even our phones now our phones do

95
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,450
everything and I got a Samsung it has

96
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,459
the pulse oximetry you know everything

97
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,170
is all right there in the phone which is

98
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,380
like what like you could even that

99
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,488
predict that five years ago right so

100
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,920
yeah I think it's just going to be

101
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:45,239
ubiquitous and if if we get these big

102
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,390
companies involved which they're already

103
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,829
you know starting to study the space

104
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:52,470
we're gonna see some crazy stuff happen

105
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:54,570
I mean the idea Elan musk was working on

106
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,040
neural lace for example he's been

107
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,170
working on it for a few years and now

108
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,959
it's made made public that he is

109
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,450
involved in its work and you know in 30

110
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,030
years you know we're gonna have

111
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:08,298
cognitive enhanced networked humans

112
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,500
where we have digital neurons

113
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:13,019
interacting with biological neurons and

114
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,700
it's going to be way better and much

115
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,680
more high-resolution than you know what

116
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,988
we could even think about today so I

117
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,060
mean radically radically different like

118
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:22,950
the stuff that we're doing I would argue

119
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,740
that the most important work that we're

120
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:28,530
doing as body hackers today is simply

121
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:32,010
preparing society for the major changes

122
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,330
that are going to come I think we need

123
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,380
to be very self aware especially at a

124
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,060
conference like this where a lot of

125
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,360
people are here are already invested in

126
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,699
the end

127
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,050
stree there techno optimists but let's

128
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,060
be realistic a lot of the tech we have

129
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,710
today is not that all amazing you know

130
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,050
it'd be of RF IDs and magnets and things

131
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,280
like that but I always compare it to the

132
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,169
Wright brothers right when they first

133
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,359
did their flight at Kitty Hawk they flew

134
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:53,609
a hundred yards a few meters off the

135
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,469
ground in the lasted about 15 seconds

136
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,909
that's not gonna get you anywhere and

137
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:59,250
especially not get you anywhere safely

138
00:04:56,909 --> 00:05:01,349
but six decades later we were landing on

139
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,330
the moon and acceleration with

140
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:06,030
technology has just increased since then

141
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,590
so you give 30 years that's a long time

142
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,138
when you consider the fact that you went

143
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:12,900
from playing on the beach to the moon in

144
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,919
60 years and as was said throughout this

145
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,750
conference I think a few times

146
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,669
predicting the future is very hard and

147
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,889
difficult so I kind of try to avoid that

148
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:22,258
in general but I just wonder what will

149
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:23,580
our landing on the moon moment be and as

150
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:24,810
you mentioned it's gonna be ubiquitous I

151
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,258
think that's coming sooner rather than

152
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,659
later

153
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:31,080
and right now biohacking is kind of that

154
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:32,969
term that describes fringe things and by

155
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,830
the time it reaches the mainstream it's

156
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:36,689
no longer called biohacking anymore it's

157
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,520
just mainstream and I think that's where

158
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:40,349
you'll see a lot of this tech go were

159
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,000
things like magnets and RFIDs and

160
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:43,889
subdermal implants to collect medical

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,229
data like we make Atwater I want to see

162
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:49,560
medical data they collect data like we

163
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:51,029
make at grindhouse that's soon gonna

164
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,620
catch on completely and it won't be

165
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:54,419
biohacking anymore and then what the bio

166
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,949
hackers are doing will be steps beyond

167
00:05:54,419 --> 00:06:00,359
that so I think like when I think about

168
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,430
the future and where we gonna go with

169
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,039
this personally I find most interesting

170
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,750
is figuring out what is going to be the

171
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,270
thing that suddenly takes it mainstream

172
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,219
like it's very nature at the moment sure

173
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,289
everyone here probably has implants or

174
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:15,240
lots of us too but in the wider

175
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,919
community like probably the only person

176
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,949
in your suburb the resin implant

177
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,240
there's gonna be a point though we're

178
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:24,689
something becomes useful enough that

179
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,919
suddenly everybody needs it like a cell

180
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:27,360
phone originally it was like only

181
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,948
businessman and it wasn't super

182
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,969
widespread and then it suddenly became

183
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:31,439
cheap enough and there's enough

184
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:34,169
functionality that everyone had to have

185
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,620
one and although obviously I'm just

186
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:39,120
guessing here but personally I think

187
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,740
limited telepathy so basically the

188
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,349
ability to send and receive takes

189
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,539
messages without interacting with

190
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:47,909
anything physically my guess like I have

191
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:49,740
a rough road map of what I would need to

192
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:52,020
do to build such a device and

193
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,389
think you know within ten years we'll be

194
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,919
there and I think that can be the point

195
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:57,210
where suddenly everyone's like I need

196
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,340
that implant and I think that's where

197
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,780
it's gonna go mainstream hmm so it

198
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,960
sounds like you all weren't saying of my

199
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,340
30 years is almost too far a stretch so

200
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,489
Alex you say ten years you think this is

201
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:10,799
I think it'll be like starting to just

202
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,169
be widespread in ten years yes I will

203
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,970
would your guests be on this it depends

204
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:16,620
on what level right so it's funny

205
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,199
because you know if you look at

206
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,550
something like iPhones it seems pretty

207
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:22,770
fantastical right it's a magical device

208
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,650
and I think but I think it may be

209
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:27,419
something more similar to like body

210
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,940
piercing it's been around a long time

211
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:31,680
but it's ubiquitous it just quietly got

212
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,060
to that point where now it's cool to go

213
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,409
to your job and not have to take about

214
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,509
jewelry out I mean maybe there's some

215
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:38,490
laggards that like setting policy but

216
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:40,680
the point is having a tattoo or a

217
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,009
piercing is not weird anymore it's just

218
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,199
everywhere so if you're talking about

219
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:47,970
simple implants that are of that nature

220
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,880
I think it'll be more like piercing and

221
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,800
it'd probably be in in ten 20 years you

222
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,849
know because it's a slowly but if we can

223
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,800
come up with something that's like

224
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:58,080
groundbreaking where you have telepathy

225
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,020
powers right and it's a it's not just

226
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,419
that but you have it's not just the the

227
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,530
novelty of being able to like interact

228
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,849
with your phone with a thing I mean

229
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,229
wearables have been doing that forever

230
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:08,699
and they just their novelty items

231
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:10,889
they've couldn't pick on the drawer

232
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:13,620
right but if you have some real actual

233
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:16,199
efficiencies being introduced that's

234
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,120
that's going to be a groundbreaker right

235
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,240
I think it's I think 20 years is

236
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,289
probably a good good point well I think

237
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,389
one of the main things you think about

238
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:25,889
with this is just how much how far we've

239
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:27,300
came in just a couple of years and I

240
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:28,110
think all of us on this stage and

241
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,909
especially people here at this

242
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,960
conference have a lot of people speaking

243
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,130
here I've gotten a lot of media

244
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,289
attention over the past couple years for

245
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,909
things they've been doing and just three

246
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:37,799
years ago a lot of the media outlets

247
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,779
would reach out to us would come at it

248
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,779
from an angle of sensationalization and

249
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:45,870
it's taboo and these people are doing

250
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,980
these procedures that should be medical

251
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,510
and they're they're crazy and they're

252
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,220
gonna kill themselves was essentially

253
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,600
with the angle they came from and now

254
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,070
today they're journalists in the

255
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,720
audience that are gonna be writing about

256
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,940
this talk and other talks and they're

257
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,110
taking it an angle of this is the future

258
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,279
these are the people that are building

259
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,250
the future and this is what's happening

260
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,540
and that all changed in a few - probably

261
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,880
24 months and

262
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,319
I can't imagine even just two years how

263
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,360
many streams this conference is gonna be

264
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,250
what other ideas we're gonna have coming

265
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,339
in and I look forward to that so I would

266
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,779
say the point where people in general

267
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,930
society are aware that this is happening

268
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:21,990
and want to get an implant is when there

269
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,819
if we get the subdermal implants to

270
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,470
collect valuable data that are around

271
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,660
the size of the RFIDs that are doing now

272
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,190
in that simple to inject I'd say once we

273
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,870
get to that point that's when it'll take

274
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,510
over completely because people get

275
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,399
piercings all over the time completely

276
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,800
for aesthetic purposes so if you can get

277
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,540
something that's that easy and get value

278
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:45,300
of it out of it why wouldn't you want to

279
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:49,319
do that so what's your process in terms

280
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,939
of developing an implant well it depends

281
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,399
on what the goals are obviously because

282
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,050
what people don't seem to realize like a

283
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,880
lot of times people come and say can't

284
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,979
you just stuff like a like a computer in

285
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,570
there like you know like pull on like

286
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,230
everything so they don't realize that

287
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:06,180
that you can't like a good example is

288
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:09,269
Arduino right an Arduino circuit board

289
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,979
is a development board you it's got all

290
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:12,990
this extra stuff all these plugs and

291
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,149
pins and all this thing is huge giant is

292
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,310
a general development board but people

293
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:19,319
will buy one and then make a project and

294
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:21,869
and then just use the development board

295
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:24,870
in the project and not really do what

296
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:27,089
you're supposed to do which is dev it on

297
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,670
the board and then make it really small

298
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:31,470
like PCB and like make it purpose-built

299
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,199
right and when you're dealing with such

300
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,660
a small space inside the body and you're

301
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:39,260
you're dealing with these kind of tricky

302
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,819
materials and things purpose building

303
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,560
means something right you can't just

304
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:44,849
make a giant general computing thing

305
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,229
it's not going to be easy to install

306
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:50,970
make or pivots other people to get so

307
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:53,699
the process starts to put the goal right

308
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,990
you get a goal you stop your goal you

309
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:56,609
design your thing and there's

310
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,480
electronics design software design

311
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,870
there's materials

312
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,430
there's process and so yeah just what

313
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,190
the guiding light is what are you trying

314
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,779
to accomplish with this thing and

315
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:08,370
there's other aspects like how easy is

316
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:10,230
it to install what's the target market

317
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:14,399
and so there's like any product really

318
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:16,769
okay so your latest product well tell me

319
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,470
what a what a what product so the latest

320
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:20,920
part is vivo

321
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:23,860
his implantable javacard platform and so

322
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,910
the goal is to essentially build a

323
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,250
bridge between a person's biological

324
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:30,310
identity and their digital identities

325
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:33,160
like accounts and communications

326
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:35,290
encryption all that stuff so with that

327
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,390
in mind it was like okay we need to you

328
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:40,000
know make it with this particular type

329
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:41,590
of electronics we need it to be easily

330
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,690
accessible so it needs to be NSC

331
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:48,070
components and all of these things and

332
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:50,590
that that just drove the design right so

333
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,940
it needs to be easy to install so that

334
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:56,470
means something when you're designing

335
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:58,360
antennas yeah there's a lot of really

336
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,520
interesting implants out there and a lot

337
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,960
of them are not powered you know you

338
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,090
have things like RF IDs which receive

339
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,010
you know they only are active when

340
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,750
they're communicating with something or

341
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,710
magnets which are passive as well but

342
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,410
what we do at grindhouse

343
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:13,330
we do powered implants under the skin

344
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,620
which is a whole new territory there's a

345
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,880
few other really interesting people here

346
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,260
that are that are working on things like

347
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,870
that I know Ben here is doing that and

348
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,819
richly as well and it's a whole new

349
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,470
landscape to deal with so what we really

350
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,650
want to focus on with our work is

351
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,450
iterative design you don't want to throw

352
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:30,100
90 features on on an implant and put it

353
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,140
in and then when something goes wrong

354
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,550
you have no idea what went wrong so

355
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,560
that's why we at Randolph started very

356
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,420
simple with just subdermal

357
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,339
LEDs that shine through the skin and

358
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,469
kind of mimic bioluminescence that

359
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,510
device is called Northstar and we really

360
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,760
got the idea from it of it from the body

361
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,840
modification community when we realized

362
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,270
that there was a market for something

363
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:52,600
like that we that was a perfect in to

364
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:54,670
test out a very simple design to see and

365
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,010
make sure everything worked well and the

366
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,079
result of that is it did so now we're

367
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,670
completing North Star version two which

368
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,710
will include gesture recognition and

369
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,930
then once we have that proven we're

370
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:07,060
gonna add back into the physiological

371
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:10,150
data sensors so it's gonna be iterative

372
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,410
design so when everyone sees this and

373
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,970
they see a media post about it and they

374
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,430
say oh why didn't you make it perfect

375
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,200
why isn't it amazing already it's the

376
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,729
things take take a little bit of time

377
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,400
but we're definitely working towards

378
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:25,990
that so I mean obviously step like the

379
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,300
very first few steps are very standard

380
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,880
with any electronic device you prototype

381
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,280
on a breadboard

382
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,230
you know then it's finalized the

383
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,310
software start thinking about what

384
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,320
components you're gonna have on there

385
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,849
like final circuit board get the PCB

386
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,310
down solder it on everything

387
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:43,350
I think like this is no different from

388
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:46,800
any you know electron device I think the

389
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:48,180
more unique part is the you know coding

390
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,160
and testing after that there's something

391
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:53,189
which most device people's don't have to

392
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,050
worry about so for me I would depend

393
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:57,090
upon the device thicker coating tied

394
00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:00,329
like glass with silicon or titanium or

395
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:03,270
something and then you know do some test

396
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:05,820
coatings do a bunch of I like testing

397
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:08,130
outside the body once I'm fairly certain

398
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:11,490
that the device is not going to you know

399
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:13,470
corrode quickly then I'll try an implant

400
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:15,540
on myself leave that in for a month or

401
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,050
two take it out extending it under a

402
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,630
microscope

403
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:20,430
check for any degradation once that's

404
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,950
fine there's no nothing's going wrong

405
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:24,390
with it then I'd start like beta testing

406
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:26,010
it giving it giving it away to people

407
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:28,380
who understand the risks and understand

408
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:30,720
that it's not you know widely tested yet

409
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,550
and then if they were also report good

410
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,970
results then making available right to

411
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,859
the public so I think like that there's

412
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:40,020
those tips of what takes a lot more time

413
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,230
and requires a lot more sort of skill

414
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:46,140
rather than the general electronics step

415
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,790
of the process um so what are the

416
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:51,990
biggest roadblocks were you in

417
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:55,530
developing new implants I would say time

418
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:57,450
and money I mean really it's when it

419
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:59,189
comes down to you know cuz it's not just

420
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:01,530
I'm experimenting in the garage or

421
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,300
whatever now it's like okay now my

422
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,980
family's got to eat right so you gotta

423
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,650
like I gotta put on my marketing hat I

424
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,560
got to put on my whatever it right so

425
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:12,810
just the the amount of time that I have

426
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,270
to just mess around in the lab is

427
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:18,689
greatly reduced and that's that's a

428
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:19,949
roadblock so it's made me focus and say

429
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:23,310
yeah I could do all these other things

430
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:25,650
but this is my focus and it's like I try

431
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:28,199
to not be the cap at the shiny object

432
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,670
right that's that that was the that was

433
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,530
the fun part of getting in the bar is

434
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:34,199
like hey you know we could do this let's

435
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,970
work on it at squirrel know where so now

436
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,620
it's like yeah all that other people do

437
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,170
that because they're gonna figure it out

438
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,230
I need to focus on this and do good at

439
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:44,530
this

440
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:47,570
I think just to echo that yeah I think

441
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:49,520
one of the big issues with this is this

442
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,260
I think a lot of investors see that

443
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,730
something like this is the future but

444
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,860
it's so new when there's so many

445
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:57,110
regulatory gray areas that it's very

446
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,460
high risk but very high reward and I

447
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,260
think we just need a bold venture

448
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,000
capitalist or investor maybe someone

449
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,370
who's audience to come talk to me who

450
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,660
wants to take the jump to put their

451
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,250
weight behind this and really make it

452
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,319
mainstream and what with those resources

453
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,600
we could really develop a lot quicker

454
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,460
but specifically road blocks will be

455
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,660
faced day to day in the lab is I think

456
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,770
someone wants something that everyone

457
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,680
who develops these staples and plans

458
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:20,090
deals with is biocompatible coatings

459
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:24,709
that do exactly what we need them to do

460
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:27,800
that don't add a lot of mass in size to

461
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,940
the implants and also energy how do you

462
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,550
power these things and there's a lot of

463
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,230
great talk in the future about energy

464
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:35,000
harvesting and using heat from the human

465
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,700
body or movement of the human body or

466
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,770
we've even amyl implanted a a solar

467
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,690
panel in his arm we did a test with that

468
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,430
but we're still working with things like

469
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:45,170
that and that is the big issue because

470
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:47,750
really you can make the technology as

471
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,339
small as you want to if you wanted to

472
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,500
we're talking to nanoscale potentially

473
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,000
but you have to have the humongous

474
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,220
battery in there at this point and

475
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,130
that's really the limiting factor so we

476
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:02,510
need to work on that so like I mean

477
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:05,630
obviously it's all kinds of robots like

478
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:08,420
the guys I mentioned for me it's

479
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:11,330
probably like time but also a personal

480
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,280
skill like hey I have fields that I'm

481
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,449
good in like I can do software and I can

482
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,760
do electronics and I can do those things

483
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,800
really well but I'm not a chemist

484
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,300
I'm not an engineer like physically

485
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:25,099
engineer those things like I you know it

486
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,720
would take me huge amounts of times if I

487
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:28,730
was to develop a new biocompatible

488
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,710
coating it would take me years and it

489
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:33,140
probably wouldn't be great so to

490
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,360
overcome those roadblocks I use like

491
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,250
proven materials so certain types of

492
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,810
glass we know that safe I don't have to

493
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,240
worry about that coating I can just use

494
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:44,149
it so I put on a new you know circuit to

495
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,470
keep coding a new circuit and that saves

496
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,170
all of time if I had to try and develop

497
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,540
my own coatings like I get kes

498
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,040
I get you to like you do a lot of

499
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,960
working coatings and that's great

500
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,399
because I couldn't do that and then once

501
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,060
you've figured out all the problems then

502
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,180
I can use

503
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,350
Oh teeny okay yeah actually that was one

504
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,420
of the things that I was gonna jump to

505
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,159
is uh talking about like the role to

506
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,540
community you know cuz obviously you

507
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,540
guys all contribute to community quite a

508
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,830
bit and they can you know the community

509
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,629
probably contributes you to to use to

510
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,100
some degree and then I wanted to talk

511
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,630
about that I will first thing I'll ask

512
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,899
though is what kind of safety testing do

513
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:19,400
you do hmm so again that depends on the

514
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,530
on the coating and what tests have

515
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,370
already been done on the material but

516
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:27,080
then there's process testing right so

517
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:29,719
like the glass glass tube is like the

518
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,990
dumbest thing to deal with because it's

519
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,340
dead simple but if you're like how if

520
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,990
you're putting the stuff in yourself and

521
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,909
then sealing it how are you sealing it

522
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,770
are you ensuring that the internals are

523
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:41,300
sterile because if it ever breaks do you

524
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,610
are you gonna you know introduce some

525
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:46,310
crazy bacteria to somebody like our is

526
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:48,679
the epoxy like sterile so materials

527
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:50,149
choosing is good then if it's something

528
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,680
like you know you're borrowing heavily

529
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,630
from the pet industry because they've

530
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,900
got it all figured out right that's the

531
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:58,880
glass tube right so I basically ensure

532
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,700
that the the factories got it

533
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,440
certifications and I've realign them you

534
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,300
know I do like maybe a lot tests I'll

535
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,740
take something out and test that or

536
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,450
something but you know dude growth

537
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,400
medium tests for example to make sure

538
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,100
the sterilization was good and make sure

539
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,660
the internals are clean and then I just

540
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,300
trust that the rest of the lot is to

541
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,430
that standard when it's new materials

542
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,020
that's where you know you have to get

543
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,400
creative and I think that's where a lot

544
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,710
of good input from the community comes

545
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,620
and a lot of ideas flow back and forth

546
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:30,350
and try different methods and and

547
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,280
whatnot to to try to test our validate

548
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,850
our theories right

549
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,680
it's a citizen science at its best yeah

550
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,080
I think that's definitely what I really

551
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,850
want to get the point across is safety

552
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,230
and reliability of these things is very

553
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,120
important especially when us as a

554
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:46,220
community depend on what other people

555
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,770
are doing as well because if one of us

556
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,520
on the stage here anyone the audience is

557
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,320
designing their own implant and

558
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,730
something goes wrong that looks badly on

559
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,919
the community as a whole so we need to

560
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,300
hold each other up to this high standard

561
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,520
of what we need to do so as far as

562
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:01,370
safety at grindhouse we do our own

563
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,900
in-house testing so we failed so many

564
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,399
batteries trying to see how they fail

565
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,860
how do we make sure they fail safely if

566
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,960
they do fail then we just smash our

567
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,350
objects we just do pressure tests and

568
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,600
eat

569
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,980
and cold tests that the human body would

570
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,418
never experience if you would experience

571
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,039
any of the things we do our testing with

572
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:18,230
you would be long dead before this

573
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:19,940
device did anything but you need to do

574
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,159
that due diligence and the other part of

575
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,630
it is I would recommend that everyone

576
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,330
does third-party testing we do

577
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:28,639
third-party cytotoxicity testing with

578
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,990
the outside lab we just send our devices

579
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:32,809
to them and they send their reports back

580
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:35,179
and I think you need that outside set of

581
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:36,590
eyes to double check your work and make

582
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:40,429
sure you're not missing anything and

583
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:41,928
that's very important yeah so I mean

584
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:44,600
different materials different devices

585
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:46,399
need different tests but I'll just pick

586
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,500
an example of like some of the stuff

587
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:50,570
that I build so obviously some stuff can

588
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,059
be outsourced but some of the chips I

589
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:55,789
have are very specialized very unique

590
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:57,799
the I can't find anyone in the world who

591
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:59,658
will do the like do the coatings for me

592
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:03,230
so I actually build those chips myself

593
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:07,490
and my lab and so a test I've developed

594
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:10,490
as an example is we use a propane torch

595
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:13,070
to seal the glass tubes but it's very

596
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,960
hard to tell 100% whether it's sealed or

597
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:17,299
whether there's a tiny hole so an

598
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,240
example test that I do on them is like

599
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:22,429
heat up the tube and that makes the air

600
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,370
inside expand as it gets hotter and then

601
00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:27,110
I tuck it in cold water if the there's a

602
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:28,729
hole then there's some of the a one have

603
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,799
escaped and as it cools down it will

604
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,940
suck water into the tube if there's

605
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,470
water inside that should have been you

606
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,509
know it's not good and you can throw it

607
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,919
out if there's no water then you know

608
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:38,750
that it's totally sealed because

609
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:40,129
otherwise the you know low pressure

610
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,440
would have drawn water into the tube so

611
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:45,049
that's like an example safety test that

612
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,309
I can do to verify that a true but it's

613
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:49,158
completely intact and there are no holes

614
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:50,960
and so it won't there's no way that the

615
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:52,580
body can interact with the internal

616
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,909
electronics it's quite it totally

617
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,678
protected and do you do cleaning on them

618
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:59,600
afterward right obviously that's the

619
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,950
after that closed that's the first test

620
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,469
to make sure that cause then you want to

621
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:04,730
like clean their boss and then sterilize

622
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,320
it and stuff afterwards but it's just

623
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,960
like one step sure sure

624
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,700
tasting process I've seen just the I

625
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,679
would suggest map gas instead of propane

626
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,139
okay I'll just because map gas doesn't

627
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:19,060
have the same hydrocarbon output like

628
00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:20,679
unburnt doesn't dope the glass with

629
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,260
laser stealing is the best but you don't

630
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:27,670
have a 3000 right I mean yeah if I had

631
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:29,740
money to buy like why do I want to play

632
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:32,710
with that 3000 amp power supply

633
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,480
yeah okay so what kind of innovation

634
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,160
would you like to see from the biohack

635
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,780
community using or regarding your

636
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,190
product so I'm gonna expand on this kind

637
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,720
of what we were saying like okay so the

638
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,370
panel is discussing plants for everyone

639
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,380
that's what it's titled as but you know

640
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:45,850
it's it's a given that the bio community

641
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,040
represents a good portion of business

642
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,580
and definitely at least it's a very

643
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,720
least of the loud voice you know of

644
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,340
supporting or promoting your products

645
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,420
and and where you're going with it you

646
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,949
know okay so it's kind of a two-part

647
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,060
question like what what would you like

648
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,640
to see coming out of the community and

649
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:04,530
like how could the community help you

650
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,530
with what you're doing hmm

651
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:11,260
let's tell it's just interesting I think

652
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,409
probably the community is already doing

653
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,150
a ton stuff that's that's the great part

654
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:17,080
there there's a lot of projects involved

655
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,480
with people working on different things

656
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:22,960
I think where some of the things that

657
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:26,230
are not so beneficial is when there's

658
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,380
just a lot of non scientific approaches

659
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:31,270
to a lot of noise right so click clean

660
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,820
it up right let's live the sort of let's

661
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:36,430
get an actual scientific method and try

662
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:38,080
to apply that as a to become more

663
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:45,490
responsible citizen scientist I think

664
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:46,990
that's probably think we're doing a lot

665
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,760
of interesting things right now in this

666
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:50,710
the subdermal space just going under the

667
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,690
skin but I'd like to see as us expand

668
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:54,100
beyond that let's interact with the

669
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:56,230
nervous system let's start working with

670
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,459
the the human organs and eventually

671
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,660
we're gonna get to the brain that's the

672
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,370
Holy Grail right that's where you want

673
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,260
to directly interface with and maybe

674
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:04,330
recreate on a different substrate

675
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,560
altogether and it's gonna take a long

676
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,419
time to get to that point what I would

677
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,450
like to see is people who are working in

678
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,830
the medical device industry kind of talk

679
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,340
to us a little bit more cochlear

680
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:16,389
implants are amazing things but they are

681
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,399
rehabilitative in the fact that they

682
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:20,440
want to bring people up to a baseline of

683
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,480
normal human and I put that in quotes

684
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,820
they're what we want to do is extend

685
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,800
beyond that and cochlear implants of

686
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,389
course could be used to do that if you

687
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,760
hack them in the right way they could

688
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:32,679
get audio information that's below or

689
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,509
above the human range of hearing and

690
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,980
map that to a different sound so you

691
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:36,999
could hear that as well but that's

692
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,769
something that's not really being

693
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:41,200
happened a lot and I would love to see

694
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:42,909
people are in that industry let's talk

695
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,409
more let's collaborate let's communicate

696
00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:49,720
and really build amazing things together

697
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:51,580
so like I can't like complain about this

698
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,070
because I do it myself but I think a lot

699
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:56,649
of people in the community work on their

700
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:58,480
own project like by themselves for a

701
00:24:56,649 --> 00:25:01,090
long time slowly improving and working

702
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,619
on it and I think if people formed

703
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,840
groups to work on stuff we could

704
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:06,490
probably progress a lot faster so if

705
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,639
everyone like spent six months working

706
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:11,110
on you know Rich's project and then we

707
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:12,008
did six months or some analysis project

708
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,629
we'd probably make a lot more progress

709
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:16,990
than everyone working on their own thing

710
00:25:13,629 --> 00:25:18,998
for two years I mean I can't you know

711
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,950
say that I don't do this because I work

712
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:22,629
on my stuff by myself as well so I'm

713
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,490
just as bad as everyone else but I think

714
00:25:22,629 --> 00:25:25,959
we could progress a lot faster if we

715
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,909
sort of read about this in more

716
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:31,240
intelligent ways so just collaboration

717
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:33,039
overall yeah so like I'm dedicated teams

718
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,389
working on like a device instead of just

719
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,340
like one person doing one device and

720
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:37,959
another person doing another device yeah

721
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,879
well it's interesting is it even like

722
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,309
watching you talk to him about map gaps

723
00:25:39,879 --> 00:25:44,469
and whatnot and it's interesting because

724
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:46,720
I've always been kind of worried about

725
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:49,600
how once you start getting into business

726
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,610
you know how that intersects with how

727
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,049
the community essentially works you know

728
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,490
there's just so much collaboration in

729
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:55,658
the community where people are freely

730
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,519
saying you know giving advice and

731
00:25:55,659 --> 00:25:59,080
sharing back and forth you know and it's

732
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:01,119
always really concerned me that we'd get

733
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,269
to a point where now it's I'm not gonna

734
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:05,918
tell you that and yeah because you're my

735
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:06,970
competitive you know I'm not gonna tell

736
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,679
you that because then someone else can

737
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,179
go out and make what I'm making yeah

738
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:11,740
whatever you know it's it's always kind

739
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:14,679
of a worry there's definitely a

740
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:17,470
transition period right so so something

741
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:19,570
that starts as an ASIC community of

742
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,340
like-minded individuals throwing ideas

743
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,629
around that's one thing and then

744
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,580
somebody's like hey I'm gonna work on

745
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:27,009
this project you know but invariably

746
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:30,100
it's the point where like it took me

747
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:32,049
from 2005 to 2013 to say let's wrap a

748
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,629
business model around this and the the

749
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:36,429
drivers were not that I thought I was

750
00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:38,649
gonna make a ton of money but I said if

751
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:40,690
I'm gonna spend all my time my free time

752
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:42,129
answering emails telling people how to

753
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:44,769
do this where to get things that are

754
00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:46,359
safe I need to be compensating like I

755
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,630
need to make some money at this so I can

756
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:49,870
buy

757
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:53,380
make it worth my while right so there is

758
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:55,870
this now kind of tension right and what

759
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:58,539
I think can help solve that is not

760
00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:00,850
overlapping products not competing with

761
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:03,190
it it's such a niche market that we're

762
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:06,100
literally fighting for every single sale

763
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:07,480
and if you have somebody then just kind

764
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,158
of entering in and competing with you

765
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,710
directly on something that's already so

766
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:16,090
niche like that's tough it's really

767
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:17,320
tough and it creates tension so like

768
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:19,269
Brian house is working on these cool

769
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,970
Northstar stuff that's awesome

770
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:24,100
like yeah and the Firefly implant I

771
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:25,629
don't want to work on that right so like

772
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,240
yeah sure here's my glass of fire or

773
00:27:25,629 --> 00:27:30,668
whatever but it's that if that thing is

774
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,049
like being collaborative when you know

775
00:27:30,669 --> 00:27:34,860
you're shooting yourself in the foot if

776
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:37,480
you're a commercial entity it's tough I

777
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:40,330
think we're such a niche market right

778
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:42,940
now that our success as a group hinges

779
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:44,289
on each other if if you do something

780
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,490
amazing or dangerous things do something

781
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:47,169
amazing or you come or something amazing

782
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:49,120
that helps all of us at this point our

783
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:51,340
success kind of reverberates off of each

784
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,989
other and I hope that will last but

785
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,059
realistically I know that as we start

786
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:57,070
growing and becoming profitable business

787
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:59,200
as we all want to be that might change

788
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:00,850
but I think I don't wanna speak for the

789
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,080
entire community but I think in my

790
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:04,178
interpersonal communication with

791
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,340
everyone individually I think we're all

792
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:07,629
on the same page that profits great but

793
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,549
that's not what drives us to do this at

794
00:28:07,629 --> 00:28:11,469
all we do this because it's an amazing

795
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:14,110
thing it will help people live better

796
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:15,399
lives be what they want to be and help

797
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,750
them do that and I don't want to make it

798
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:17,799
sound like some grand thing because I

799
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,360
realize while we're doing at this point

800
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:21,820
it's putting magnets in our fingers Wow

801
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,979
but I that's the goal like we want to

802
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,658
build to that and anything that I can do

803
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,879
to help someone else get to that point

804
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:30,759
it's not a zero-sum game their success

805
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:32,049
isn't my loss necessarily and I would

806
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:33,220
you know wish the best to everyone on

807
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:34,690
the stage I hope everyone succeeds in

808
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,240
what they're doing and it's any way that

809
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:38,080
I could help I will so there's a couple

810
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,899
of things I'd like to say about that

811
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,509
firstly um I agree with what I'm alcide

812
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:45,879
like to expand on that not only are you

813
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:46,929
thing competing more but you spending a

814
00:28:45,879 --> 00:28:48,279
lot of like wasting a lot of time

815
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:50,200
reinventing the wheel someone's already

816
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:51,429
done something and you want to you know

817
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,889
compete with that and you have to

818
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,639
reinvent the wheel to you know do what

819
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:57,490
I've already done

820
00:28:54,639 --> 00:28:59,740
it's like wasted research time if you

821
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:00,460
did something new then within that were

822
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,860
two different and

823
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:07,389
versus just two of the same implants

824
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:09,729
from different people secondly so like I

825
00:29:07,389 --> 00:29:12,189
didn't get into this field to make money

826
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,570
like I want to be a sidewalk I want to

827
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:15,580
have in your own interface that I can

828
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:17,950
browse the nation's stuff the only

829
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:20,799
reason I like made like sad the company

830
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:23,049
was it for it was because I want to like

831
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,850
I forget the inflow of money I can use

832
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:27,009
on bit of research tools I can you know

833
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:28,330
turn that over and say okay so you

834
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:29,799
brought us and then I spend the money on

835
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:31,960
a new microscope or something and that's

836
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:34,360
that's like my motivation for it is to

837
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,909
be able to fund the advanced research

838
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:40,330
that I can't do just with my own income

839
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:42,399
the idea is that we can eventually one

840
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:43,689
day have a whole research lab of you

841
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,158
know people engineers and scientists

842
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,720
working on something and then we can

843
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,509
really make some significant progress

844
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,249
no absolutely okay so what is your

845
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:56,049
biggest concern regarding safety for

846
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:57,549
biohackers in general I think that and

847
00:29:56,049 --> 00:29:59,110
we kind of touched on this on other

848
00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:01,450
panels like ethics panels and things but

849
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:03,879
the openness of the community allowing

850
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:05,409
like like people come to me with how can

851
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:08,320
I get in by hacking go to the forum

852
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:11,230
right and they've lost mine you know

853
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,539
explodes but the the lack of rigor right

854
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:15,100
is it's like the the dangerous thing

855
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:17,200
would be for somebody to come in and see

856
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,539
everybody's doing this it's super easy

857
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,009
I'm gonna take some glue and stick it on

858
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:21,549
a thing and then jam it on my body I'm a

859
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:25,679
biohacker

860
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:29,110
and and like attracting spotlights to

861
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:32,049
irresponsible self research right well

862
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:34,449
will harm the community so that's that's

863
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:37,360
a bit scary but I think that you know

864
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:38,889
the the the negative side of like the

865
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,508
negative impact of the community of

866
00:30:38,889 --> 00:30:41,918
being business and like being in

867
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:44,139
business and like how that can create

868
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,029
tension it also means that those people

869
00:30:44,139 --> 00:30:47,709
are gonna be a way more responsible to

870
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:49,179
now their their research and their

871
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:51,399
livelihoods are dependent on you know

872
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:53,320
not killing their customers right so

873
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:55,418
there's positives but but yeah I think

874
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,639
even with just some of the transponders

875
00:30:55,419 --> 00:30:59,350
that I sell there's certainty of like a

876
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:01,539
couple times in the last couple of years

877
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:03,100
I've like people email me these

878
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:05,799
questions and in the course of the

879
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,990
conversation I'm like yeah I don't want

880
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:09,490
to sell to you they'll buy it and I'll

881
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:11,259
be like I'm refunding your money don't

882
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,990
do it because I just get the feeling

883
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:20,460
that they would just

884
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:24,960
be completely erase this part and I was

885
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,490
like why you know so I mean this is you

886
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,020
know he's very enthusiastic but I'm like

887
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:30,360
yeah no I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna

888
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:32,370
sell to you sorry yeah just I I think

889
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,050
the the the openness and the idea of

890
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:36,270
self experimentation could get somebody

891
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:37,490
to get carried away and then put a bad

892
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:39,510
light on

893
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:41,610
yeah I wonder percent agree with that

894
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:43,170
people doing something irresponsible to

895
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:45,629
themselves and then that looks bad on

896
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:46,820
the community is a big concern and the

897
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:49,050
other one I think I would have is

898
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:51,200
pseudoscience creeping in a little bit I

899
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:53,129
think you mentioned on the last panel

900
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,240
there's things like the nootropics and

901
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:56,130
stuff that everyone a lot of people

902
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,140
making claims that are just not backed

903
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:59,670
up by science and you don't even have to

904
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,530
go too far to see things like that where

905
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,880
you know is this crystal gonna realign

906
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:04,740
your chakras and stuff like that and

907
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,300
biohacking is becoming this marketing

908
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,270
buzzword now and a lot of people were

909
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,200
are hinging on that and if you search

910
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:11,790
biohacking on instagram you're gonna see

911
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,490
a lot of pictures of avocado toast like

912
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:16,080
that's not mmm that's I don't understand

913
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:18,059
what's happening there but we need to be

914
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,790
very diligent to keep these kind of

915
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:22,470
things out of the real science that

916
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:24,750
we're actually doing in original

917
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,190
research and make sure that everyone

918
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,210
knows that if you're gonna be in this

919
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,250
community and you're gonna actually

920
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:30,809
develop things and work towards it you

921
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:33,179
need to be scientifically literate you

922
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:35,639
need to use the scientific method and

923
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:36,870
not just feel things because the right

924
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,440
and then use that to market your product

925
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:42,659
yeah so I suppose I see it as something

926
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,880
that has long-term consequences like

927
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:47,309
okay so some person can go and implement

928
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,000
something really substandard and you

929
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:49,800
know get hurt

930
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,990
but it's sort of a one-off thing and

931
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,010
it's usually pretty immediate like they

932
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:55,320
didn't sterilize it and they got

933
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,980
infected I think what I would be most

934
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,428
afraid of

935
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:01,710
there's someone designing something that

936
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:04,350
seems fine and then becomes widespread

937
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:06,120
and then it becomes unsafe like imagine

938
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,709
someone designed something with carbon

939
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,239
nanotubes and everyone thinks it's safe

940
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:11,760
and it spreads throughout the community

941
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,080
and then five years later we find that

942
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,640
it causes cancer or something and

943
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,080
suddenly it's a big deal

944
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,880
so I'm not so worried about the

945
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,250
individual I'm worried about

946
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,250
something that's sort of long-term

947
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:28,970
okay so how let's see

948
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:31,280
what products or endeavors are you or

949
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:34,640
possible future projects or endeavors

950
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:36,820
you most excited about I would say that

951
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,020
like right now the focus on vevo key and

952
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,939
building that I was a platform and all

953
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,410
of the like the really annoying thing

954
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,700
about it is that the technology has been

955
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,800
done for a while it's now like

956
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,720
partnerships and people and policy and

957
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:52,340
like people are way harder to deal with

958
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,600
than the technology but the thing that's

959
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,459
interesting and citing to me is because

960
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,340
as a side project we've been working on

961
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:00,200
an energy storage cell that's it's

962
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:03,080
similar to lithium similar density but

963
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,450
I'm safer right and the idea is it's got

964
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,710
to be safe and that's you know once we

965
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,420
get to the point where we're happy with

966
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,850
the design then an all whole nother

967
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:12,710
round of testing happens but once once

968
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:15,020
we have something like that then the

969
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:18,800
idea of really expanding power devices

970
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:21,139
in a way that's that's safe is it's like

971
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,780
the sky's limit let's work on something

972
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:25,879
really amazing lithium is great but you

973
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,710
know you can you can design it a circuit

974
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:30,320
board perfectly but you're not queueing

975
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:32,090
every component that goes on there like

976
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,190
to the great degree that a medical

977
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:36,380
device gets Qaid and you know if you

978
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:38,090
have something go out of spec six months

979
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:40,970
after its implanted and the battery

980
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:43,820
explodes like a samsung like it's not

981
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:45,560
good I can give you our exact roadmap of

982
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,850
what we plan on doing at grindhouse and

983
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,380
I'm not gonna give a timeframe on it

984
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,299
because I realized that a lot of it is

985
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:52,460
extremely optimistic and depends on a

986
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,690
lot of other things going right but at

987
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,220
the end of this year I think we're gonna

988
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,320
be pretty close to having two commercial

989
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,490
products out and available for purchase

990
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,740
that would be North Star version 1 and

991
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:02,270
version 2 we also have the device called

992
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,189
bottle nose which interacts with an

993
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:06,710
implanted magnet and that'll be

994
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:08,360
available as well and we the next step

995
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,350
after that is getting back to the the

996
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,170
first thing we ever did which was

997
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:14,029
circadian Cheng's MIT's biological data

998
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:15,950
physiological data from yourself to your

999
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,870
phone to have a constant log of your

1000
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:20,120
body's metrics and what changes that in

1001
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,990
your your surroundings so that's gonna

1002
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,420
be something I think we're gonna be

1003
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:26,540
hitting hard again next year after that

1004
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:29,120
we want to get to the nervous system so

1005
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,940
that would be sending data allowing you

1006
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:34,130
to control things in your environment

1007
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,900
from your body and then switching that

1008
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:37,610
around and having your environment the

1009
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,900
internet-of-things send things directly

1010
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,220
to your nervous system

1011
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,260
completely passively you don't need to

1012
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,270
read or listen or feel anything you just

1013
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:46,970
get the information sent to you from

1014
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:48,920
there we want to do organs I think one

1015
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:51,439
of the things that when people will get

1016
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,569
here things like okay if you live long

1017
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,039
enough you might lose a limb in an

1018
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:57,170
accident or you have to get a hip

1019
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,390
replacement or one of your organs goes

1020
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:00,440
bad eventually just by virtue of living

1021
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:03,529
long enough you're gonna turn into a

1022
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,750
cyborg you if you can't alright so what

1023
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:07,760
we realize is your organs are going to

1024
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:10,309
go back your biological organs have a

1025
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,900
shelf life and you hope that if you live

1026
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:13,460
long enough for your heart to go bad you

1027
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,799
hope that you're close enough to a

1028
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,329
hospital to survive that or if you need

1029
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:19,759
a heart transplant you hope that some

1030
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:20,809
other poor person dies so that you can

1031
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,270
get their heart and that's a horrible

1032
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:26,119
system so I think we should work towards

1033
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:29,210
replacing these biological organs with

1034
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:31,220
ones that are more reliable before it

1035
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:32,900
needs to happen and then the long-term

1036
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:38,720
goal as I mentioned earlier is is the

1037
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:40,099
brain so in the medium-term so right now

1038
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,160
we all know about the fire and chips

1039
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:44,299
which have a temperature sensor on them

1040
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,649
but that's sort of a pain because you

1041
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:47,390
need a custom reader for it and

1042
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:49,609
temperature is not that great it's

1043
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:51,348
basically an implanted thermometer but

1044
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:53,509
currently something that I've got in

1045
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:55,609
development it does temperature heart

1046
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,930
rate and blood oxygen content so that's

1047
00:36:55,609 --> 00:36:58,038
sort of I don't wanna give an exact time

1048
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:59,180
because I've done that before and then

1049
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:59,900
people keep bugging me were like is it

1050
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,940
done is it done

1051
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,170
but there's something like I've got the

1052
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,880
hardware sorted out I just need to

1053
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:08,089
finish up the code and stuff so that's

1054
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,579
sort of the more medium term there's

1055
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:14,240
like more pile of biometric sensors and

1056
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:16,910
an implant and then long-term like my

1057
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,558
focus I want to be is like no neural

1058
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:20,750
interfaces and nerves and that sort of

1059
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,640
thing so stuff you can like getting

1060
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,990
notifications so you'll feel an impulse

1061
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,770
and you notice when you know you have a

1062
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:31,250
new message that type of thing okay

1063
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:32,538
well I think really this one was

1064
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:35,990
probably covered in the last discussion

1065
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:37,279
more than anything but I'll just ask for

1066
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,990
a short version of you know how to how

1067
00:37:37,279 --> 00:37:43,490
do your products different from from

1068
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:45,740
medical products well I mean if you

1069
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:48,799
think about the FDA's actual definition

1070
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:50,890
of a magical device the primary one is a

1071
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:54,430
treatment diagnosis

1072
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:56,319
of disease right and does it alter the

1073
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:59,500
structure of the body and does it

1074
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,880
interact with the body chemically so you

1075
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,330
know no doesn't do any of those things

1076
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,700
it's totally non medical device I mean

1077
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:08,950
it's it's for personal enhancement and

1078
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:11,799
augmentation so it's in some ways it's

1079
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:15,009
like body jewelry and in other ways it's

1080
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:17,370
it's it's totally elective so you know

1081
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:20,890
it's not a medical necessity to have

1082
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:23,170
that may change actually later in

1083
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:25,060
society in a society where everybody's

1084
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,830
enhanced right a normal natural born

1085
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:29,110
human is already at a disadvantage

1086
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:31,330
because the whole of society is is

1087
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:33,250
already augmented you might see

1088
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:34,840
something like just like you know you

1089
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:37,530
can get a government cell phone for free

1090
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:40,270
because a cell phone is considered a

1091
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:42,640
utility that is you know critical for

1092
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:45,610
functioning and you might see the

1093
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,620
government implant right set up implants

1094
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:49,540
or whatever so it's it's interesting but

1095
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:52,930
as a medical device of restorative

1096
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:54,160
device no we're not okay yeah it sounds

1097
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,690
like you're it basically spend the

1098
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,060
difference is intent rather than

1099
00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:01,330
differences in the product an intent but

1100
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:03,880
also application I mean in product you

1101
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:05,890
could you can make a bad product and

1102
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,830
hurt people but why would you that so in

1103
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:10,150
terms of a medical you know when you're

1104
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:12,580
talking about materials and device and

1105
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:14,320
testing we're not regulated like we are

1106
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:17,290
with the FDA so the the case study

1107
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,810
requirements and all of that are not a

1108
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:22,740
requirement but we do the same I mean

1109
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:24,759
beta testing and things like that so

1110
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,399
hopefully there's little difference

1111
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:31,000
between the rigor that a medical device

1112
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:33,640
undergoes and what we do now rigor can

1113
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,190
be you know less so for like for example

1114
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,870
software changes in a implantable device

1115
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:40,230
like it's Acadia if there's a software

1116
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:42,490
problem and the thing just brick yeah

1117
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:44,530
okay bummer but you're not like your

1118
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:46,479
heart's not gonna stop right so it's in

1119
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:48,700
certain ways you know it would suck but

1120
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,090
you don't have to necessarily apply the

1121
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:54,189
same rigor and testing and all of that

1122
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:57,130
for for every aspect of the device but

1123
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:59,440
certain things you really shouldn't you

1124
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:01,880
should apply the same rigor particularly

1125
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,400
for I can say powered devices

1126
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,840
I made the point earlier that it's only

1127
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,550
biohacking until it becomes mainstream

1128
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,680
and I think that's when you see things

1129
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:11,240
like this taking place like I'd say

1130
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,100
anyone with a pacemaker is far more

1131
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,379
augmented than any of us on this stage

1132
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,640
on and there's other implantable

1133
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,380
contraceptives or other things that

1134
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,850
people could use that are technology

1135
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,500
inside the body that are serving a

1136
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:23,180
purpose that augment the human

1137
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,220
capabilities and I think that's an

1138
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:28,339
important thing to realize and the

1139
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:29,899
difference is that the medical devices

1140
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:32,300
are used to bring people up to an

1141
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,650
arbitrary normal and we what we don't

1142
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,090
care about the arbitrary normal we just

1143
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:36,770
want to be whatever you want to be if

1144
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:38,450
you don't want to censor you want an

1145
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:40,610
additional sense let's let that be

1146
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:43,370
capable of happening and I think there's

1147
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:44,900
a certain weight that may be worth while

1148
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:47,960
it may not be that's given to things

1149
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,790
like the FDA or to academic universities

1150
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,560
where they figure if it comes out of

1151
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:53,210
academia or it comes out of a corporate

1152
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,370
R&D department or it's approved by the

1153
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:56,930
FDA then it's good and it's worthwhile

1154
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,310
and that's proven to be that but like

1155
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,899
you mentioned in the last panel people

1156
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:02,990
get killed by fda-approved devices all

1157
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,940
the time and even if our devices aren't

1158
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:08,660
necessarily go through the rigors of FDA

1159
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:10,970
approval we often times use FDA approved

1160
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,859
materials already we try to find those

1161
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:14,149
things that meet that criteria whether

1162
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:16,820
we're gonna go through that process or

1163
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:20,240
not I think the big difference is just

1164
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:22,700
how you want to use it right now anyone

1165
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,410
who works with inside the human body and

1166
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,839
cuts it open and does things has to go

1167
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:28,129
through Medical School but this that's

1168
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,290
the wrong way to look at this this is a

1169
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:32,690
whole new industry I would love to see

1170
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:35,690
people follow a career path that isn't

1171
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:37,070
called medicine that is about cutting

1172
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:38,390
into the human body and augmenting it

1173
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,860
but it's a different terminology a

1174
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:43,220
completely different thing because they

1175
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:47,090
shouldn't be regulated the same way yeah

1176
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:50,480
so regulations have like pros and cons

1177
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:52,250
obviously having a mandated testing that

1178
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,110
every implant has to go through before

1179
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:56,300
it can be sold or something that's great

1180
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:57,890
in the sense that we know it's gonna be

1181
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,770
safe well it's much more likely to be

1182
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:03,080
safe and you have some assurances about

1183
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:05,630
what tests have been done on it there

1184
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:07,970
are downsides though that it may it has

1185
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:10,370
this huge like really high bar for entry

1186
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:12,620
so you want to vote new implant and you

1187
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:15,049
don't have you know $100,000 to fund the

1188
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:16,850
testing then sorry out of luck

1189
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:19,370
with the whole hacker community in

1190
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:20,960
spirit it's like I mean Judas in my

1191
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,029
garage I'm just someone who wants to you

1192
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,190
know start from scratch and so there are

1193
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:29,750
pros and cons and I'm not sure that I

1194
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:31,220
can say which is better like maybe in

1195
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:33,020
this I definitely think that in the

1196
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,669
future it will be regulations put in

1197
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:39,620
place I don't know how long that's gonna

1198
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:41,990
take to happen but for now like we seem

1199
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:44,029
to be reasonably self-regulating so far

1200
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:44,509
we haven't had any major sort of

1201
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:47,990
screw-ups

1202
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:49,790
and I think so far so good one day we'll

1203
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:50,750
have to deal with regulation and deal

1204
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:53,029
with that when we come to it

1205
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,410
awesome no if people wanted to get a

1206
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:55,880
hold of you or purchase your products

1207
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:57,440
where would they how'd they find how

1208
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,810
would they find you dangerous things

1209
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,730
dot-com excellent we are grindhouse but

1210
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,900
we're we're on all the social medias and

1211
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:04,310
if you want to learn more about this

1212
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,930
specifically I muscle the host of the

1213
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:07,640
future grind podcast where I talk to a

1214
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,899
lot of bio hackers or futurists in

1215
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,279
general about what they're working on so

1216
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,780
if you're kind of new to this community

1217
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,490
and really want to learn more look up

1218
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,870
future grind and my name is Ryan O'Shea

1219
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:17,540
and I'm accessible on all the social

1220
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:19,730
medias as well yeah like I have a booth

1221
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:21,830
out there you can come say hi and you

1222
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:23,750
know you take out the experimental stuff

1223
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:25,340
I'm working on or whatever I'm also like

1224
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:27,170
there's my science eyebrows on me and

1225
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:28,970
I'm on Twitter and stuff so you know on

1226
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:30,560
the forums and whatever so you know

1227
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:33,680
contact me I'm pretty approachable I

1228
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,450
feel like you know an email or two a day

1229
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,649
from interesting community members who

1230
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:38,359
ask some questions and stuff about

1231
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:40,070
different things actually and I wanted

1232
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,630
to actually throw out one more thing at

1233
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:44,350
a resource is that I think every one of

1234
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:46,670
these gentlemen has done a interview on

1235
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:49,339
there's a really great podcast called

1236
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:50,690
dangerous mind and I'm pretty sure Alex

1237
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:54,080
yours you were interviewed but it hasn't

1238
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:55,400
come out yet not yet so very soon all

1239
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,960
three will have done and I've not been

1240
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,840
on it oh you haven't done yet I'm sure

1241
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,480
that'll be ready soon yeah okay so okay

1242
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,040
so after Alex oh but anyways it's

1243
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,330
actually pretty good and you know I

1244
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,370
think each of these topics they kind of

1245
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:09,920
have gone gone earth well I don't know I

1246
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:12,470
haven't heard your guys's but I they

1247
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,670
generally go into a lot of detail on the

1248
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:15,919
stuff they're doing as well so it'd be

1249
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:17,480
great thing to check out now I think we

1250
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,160
have about 10 minutes left or so and I

1251
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,280
just wanted to open up the floor and

1252
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:24,430
does anybody have any questions

1253
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,430
go ahead

1254
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,870
hmm I'll have to think about that person

1255
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,610
yeah I don't know if I can come up with

1256
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:49,330
a specific one in general but I would

1257
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:51,040
say just I'd say art and science have

1258
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:52,810
been communicating together for a long

1259
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,190
time and they're kind of quickly now

1260
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:55,840
with technology becoming one in the same

1261
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:57,690
and especially with biohacking which

1262
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:00,550
it's such a cross-disciplinary thing

1263
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:02,730
where you can't just be a chemist or an

1264
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:04,900
engineer or a software developer or

1265
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:07,390
medical doctor and work in this industry

1266
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:09,010
you need to have either you need to be a

1267
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:10,900
Renaissance person who has it all or

1268
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:11,650
more likely you need to communicate with

1269
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,120
everyone else

1270
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:15,310
so what really motivates me is the

1271
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,990
people who have tackled those grand

1272
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:18,610
challenges before and you look at the

1273
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:19,750
history of amazing scientists and I

1274
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:21,580
think the common quote is like you're

1275
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,170
standing on the shoulders of giants and

1276
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:24,549
I think that's exactly what we're doing

1277
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:26,770
like so many amazing people have come

1278
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:28,810
before who not necessarily were bio

1279
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:30,340
hackers but set the stage for us to do

1280
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:33,160
what we're doing today and the reason

1281
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:34,390
you're seeing this now is because one of

1282
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,670
the first human barriers that we

1283
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:37,960
overcome recently was geography you know

1284
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:39,760
you're from Australia but we talk all

1285
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,800
the time on on the forums and share

1286
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,480
ideas and people are in California and

1287
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,640
Oregon we're in Pennsylvania and it's

1288
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,680
just we're talking back and forth all

1289
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,120
the time and I think that that's really

1290
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,589
what so the people who built these

1291
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:55,210
systems to make that possible are the

1292
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:58,900
ones that I really thank for that yeah

1293
00:45:55,210 --> 00:46:01,090
so I know they say like necessity is the

1294
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,980
mother of innovation and this is like

1295
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:05,350
the opposite of them right no one needs

1296
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:07,870
the implants we have it's not necessary

1297
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:10,569
but I think it's the same sort of

1298
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:13,000
driving force and that you see this

1299
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:15,370
really high goal like I want to be a

1300
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,490
cyborg I want to you know be able to do

1301
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:20,470
these amazing things and it's just so

1302
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:22,299
far from reality and then you sort of

1303
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:24,580
think well what's the closest I can get

1304
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:26,380
today and you take that step and you

1305
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:28,630
think okay what's the next easiest thing

1306
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:30,340
I can do and you do that and it's just

1307
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:34,320
sort of slowly building on previous work

1308
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:34,320
and slowly taking the next step

1309
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:55,780
well the 4s working on the B Voki is a

1310
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:58,060
direct result of that so oftentimes

1311
00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:00,430
people ask about the security of our

1312
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:01,990
implantable transponders and they're not

1313
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:05,609
designed for security right I mean

1314
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:07,959
bottom line but the the risk you know

1315
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:10,150
vectors are very very narrow because his

1316
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,710
personal use right the idea is that

1317
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:13,420
you're going to have this device is

1318
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:15,580
you're gonna use it with your mate home

1319
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:18,310
lock and you know login of your personal

1320
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:19,660
computer the difference is very clear

1321
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:21,549
when you compare it to something that's

1322
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:23,440
more generalized like a contactless

1323
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:24,880
payment credit card for example so

1324
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,870
somebody wants to collect a bunch of

1325
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,280
credit cards they could just stand

1326
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:28,390
around with a reader and beep people

1327
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,550
when they walk by that's a random

1328
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:32,140
attacker getting data that they know how

1329
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:34,120
to use they don't need to know you or

1330
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,410
anything and so the attack vector is

1331
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,600
very wide

1332
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:38,980
if someone weren't able to get close

1333
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,060
enough to read an implant that they

1334
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,560
probably didn't even know you had in the

1335
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,870
first place they would get a number

1336
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,150
that's really not read there's no

1337
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:48,940
context right so they don't know how to

1338
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:50,680
use that or what it's for but you know

1339
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,900
when we're talking about society at

1340
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:55,450
large adopting this a large scale you

1341
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,980
need more more computing power to do

1342
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:59,680
cryptography and I actually address

1343
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:00,790
security concerns and so you know

1344
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,069
cryptography is been around a long time

1345
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:04,960
but the reality is it's not really used

1346
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:07,300
heavily because once you secure your

1347
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,720
life with cryptography and you lose your

1348
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:12,940
token you are in a world of hurt so you

1349
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,379
know the idea was like what's these

1350
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,730
things are convenient things and they're

1351
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:18,580
novelty items and they're they're

1352
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:21,010
they're cool but let's solve real

1353
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:23,470
problems and so that was the impetus

1354
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:25,900
behind developing people key and to be a

1355
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,069
cryptography solution well with you what

1356
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,960
you want to do with your implants a lot

1357
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,490
of that I mean information security is

1358
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,780
very important for that what we were

1359
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,549
doing a crying house it's not quite at

1360
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:35,170
that point yet once we get back to the

1361
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:36,540
physiological data it will because you

1362
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:39,130
DIF want to protect your personal data

1363
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:40,210
but I mean as I think was mentioned in

1364
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:41,920
the opening keynote of this entire

1365
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:43,090
conference the person who's using the

1366
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,010
device should own their data and be able

1367
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,330
to control all of that we want to be

1368
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:47,470
very hands-off when it comes to that we

1369
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:48,640
don't want to store your data so we

1370
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:50,859
don't want to have the responsibility of

1371
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,589
securing your data but as far as just

1372
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:55,780
the protocols of devices communicating

1373
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:56,770
back and forth I really think that's one

1374
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:59,020
of the big things that this in

1375
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:00,190
biohacking industry needs to focus on I

1376
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,870
don't know if enough attention has been

1377
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:03,000
given it to it yet and I'm glad you

1378
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:04,950
asked the question it's taking us a car

1379
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,260
station that needs to start and to be

1380
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:09,330
honest that's not my expertise it's not

1381
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:10,620
a problem that I can solve but I'd love

1382
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:12,330
to work with the communities that could

1383
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:13,589
and I know you know the the group that

1384
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:15,180
put on this conference also does an

1385
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:16,710
information security conference so let's

1386
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:18,240
go there let's talk to these people and

1387
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:19,500
let's get these groups communicating

1388
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,390
with each other to really see what we

1389
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,940
need to do to make sure that everyone's

1390
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:26,160
data is kept safe safe to the point

1391
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:27,450
where privacy isn't a concern when you

1392
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,799
think about adopting things that could

1393
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:32,580
improve your life we don't want any

1394
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:34,560
barriers for entry there okay yeah so

1395
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:37,259
like that's an interesting question for

1396
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,520
sure so like biohacking is not what I do

1397
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,110
full-time like it's just something out

1398
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,880
of the weekend I have a day job in my

1399
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:44,550
day job I'm like an honest-to-god hacker

1400
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:47,070
I think we call ourselves investors

1401
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:48,990
security consultants like ethical stuff

1402
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:51,360
only making companies when they ask us

1403
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:53,959
to and they pay us to but I'm intimately

1404
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:56,220
aware of the security challenges and I

1405
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,990
would say it's well a lot of the

1406
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:00,270
implants that I sell is the opposite of

1407
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:02,040
that they are intended to be insecure

1408
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:05,100
they are intended so that you can copy

1409
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:07,680
your you know apartment key or your

1410
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:09,750
transit card onto your implant if they

1411
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,339
were truly secure you wouldn't be able

1412
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:13,260
to do that you would be able to copy

1413
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:15,420
their card onto your empire the whole

1414
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:17,880
point of the implant is that the

1415
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:21,300
technology is not secure it allows you

1416
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:23,780
to use it in these ways excellent any

1417
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,780
other questions

1418
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:45,180
we get emails all the time from people

1419
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,558
not necessarily Hugh we do that ones

1420
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:48,450
from people are already in the medical

1421
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,890
device industry or medical doctors but

1422
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:51,689
more often than that I think it's a

1423
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:54,359
generational thing we get people that

1424
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:55,559
are in medical school all the time so

1425
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:58,470
I'm really optimistic about with this

1426
00:50:55,559 --> 00:51:00,240
next generation of doctors and designers

1427
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:01,230
and engineers in this field what their

1428
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,129
relationship is gonna be with this

1429
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:04,049
community because this is something

1430
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:05,099
they're starting to to know about when

1431
00:51:04,049 --> 00:51:06,509
they're learning they're going through

1432
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:07,740
school they're kind of growing up with

1433
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:10,140
it now and I think that's really

1434
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:11,759
powerful so to answer your question yes

1435
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:13,799
we do have direct communication with

1436
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,079
people in these fields a lot of it they

1437
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:18,119
don't publicly come out in support of us

1438
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,740
because that puts unfortunately that

1439
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:22,440
sometimes puts their reputation or their

1440
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:24,470
jobs on the line but especially I think

1441
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,910
our into that world would be through

1442
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:29,220
cosmetic surgery in plastic surgery I

1443
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:31,109
recently had a phone conversation with a

1444
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:33,299
very well-known plastic surgeon in

1445
00:51:31,109 --> 00:51:34,859
Beverly Hills who really wants to start

1446
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:36,750
working with the biohacking community

1447
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:39,029
and how can these groups work together

1448
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:40,589
so that people right right now the body

1449
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:42,630
modification community is perfect for us

1450
00:51:40,589 --> 00:51:44,099
we're doing subdermal implants they are

1451
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:45,720
experts in their field and many of them

1452
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:47,730
have a background in medical training

1453
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,348
but we're quickly gonna get to the point

1454
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:50,730
where that's not enough we need actual

1455
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:52,890
medical doctors that help us with these

1456
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:54,690
procedures and we need to start now with

1457
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:56,308
that communication so yeah it happens

1458
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:59,640
but I'd like it to be more public than

1459
00:51:56,309 --> 00:52:01,880
private I think I saw one more hand over

1460
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,879
here

1461
00:52:22,999 --> 00:52:28,069
well that that depends on a lot to

1462
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:30,900
things primarily the external

1463
00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:32,880
applications and interfaces which are a

1464
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:36,059
lot of times designed to be proprietary

1465
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,859
right unfortunately because they have

1466
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:40,349
different revenue models they want to

1467
00:52:37,859 --> 00:52:43,828
build on that proprietary proprietary

1468
00:52:40,349 --> 00:52:46,079
approach but in terms of biohacking as a

1469
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:47,669
community I think when we get to the

1470
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,890
point where we're starting to deal with

1471
00:52:47,669 --> 00:52:52,679
always-on devices powered devices right

1472
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:55,049
there and leveraging different wireless

1473
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:58,469
technologies I think that the idea of

1474
00:52:55,049 --> 00:53:02,279
developing a common protocol like speaks

1475
00:52:58,469 --> 00:53:03,869
Bluetooth or speaks bio hacks 1.0 that

1476
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:05,549
that is an idea that's been floating

1477
00:53:03,869 --> 00:53:08,699
around for a while at least in my brain

1478
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:11,009
to be able to say some sort of protocol

1479
00:53:08,699 --> 00:53:13,890
that says hey I'm a device I'm in the

1480
00:53:11,009 --> 00:53:17,039
body area network I have these resources

1481
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:19,348
I have an LED and I have so whatever

1482
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:21,779
right screen or who knows what

1483
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:25,169
and then other devices that may want to

1484
00:53:21,779 --> 00:53:27,029
leverage those input outputs right might

1485
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:28,439
be able to say hey I got information I

1486
00:53:27,029 --> 00:53:30,809
need to communicate it to the user or

1487
00:53:28,439 --> 00:53:32,879
send it this way but that's all very you

1488
00:53:30,809 --> 00:53:34,499
know we're we're not quite there yet but

1489
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,140
I think taking that under consideration

1490
00:53:34,499 --> 00:53:38,698
and saying let's let's like try to

1491
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:41,038
co-develop some sort of interactive

1492
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:44,339
protocol that doesn't limit or restrict

1493
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:46,859
device design but it just says hey if

1494
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:49,699
you're gonna make a device let's try to

1495
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:53,308
make it speak this particular language

1496
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:55,349
angry yeah so I know how you feel like I

1497
00:53:53,309 --> 00:53:56,669
take stuff out all the time to make room

1498
00:53:55,349 --> 00:54:02,069
for the new thing that I'm building and

1499
00:53:56,669 --> 00:54:04,529
testing so as an example like early RFID

1500
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:06,989
chips they do one application at a time

1501
00:54:04,529 --> 00:54:08,459
like one ID and so if you want to have

1502
00:54:06,989 --> 00:54:11,939
like three buildings then you need three

1503
00:54:08,459 --> 00:54:13,439
implants but one of the chips that I've

1504
00:54:11,939 --> 00:54:15,598
like designed but haven't started

1505
00:54:13,439 --> 00:54:18,089
building yet it'll allow just to a

1506
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,589
multiple you know ready IDs on the same

1507
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:20,699
chip and we'll just like cycle through

1508
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,739
them so you print up to the thing and

1509
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:24,569
wait a second and all cycle through the

1510
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:26,009
IDs your free program and so that means

1511
00:54:24,569 --> 00:54:28,259
you could have one chip that does like

1512
00:54:26,009 --> 00:54:30,120
several different buildings they want

1513
00:54:28,259 --> 00:54:32,810
that ship yeah

1514
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:34,589
all right well thank you very much guys

1515
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:36,509
great and if you guys have any other

1516
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:38,780
further questions for them you can come

1517
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:41,220
down and ask him yourself

1518
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:45,110
thank you

1519
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:45,109
[Applause]
