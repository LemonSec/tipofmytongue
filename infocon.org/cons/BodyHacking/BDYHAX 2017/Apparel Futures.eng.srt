2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,619
and I am honored my name's Valerie

3
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,419

00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,330
our startups excuse me

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,950
many of which are here today so I'm

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,390
gonna turn it over to each of our

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,550
panelists they're gonna introduce

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,989
themselves and just really we're gonna

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,788
kind of jump in and they're gonna tell

13
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,919
you a little bit about themselves what

14
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:46,100
they do and then we'll kind of kick off

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,100
the discussion from there hi everyone I

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:54,750
Know Who I am but yeah first time my

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,370
name is Christina Dimitrova and I am the

18
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:02,190
founder of interlaced we are a platform

19
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:05,759
for events and news around the future of

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,429
fashion and tech so we were Co producing

21
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:11,280
the show the fashion tech show that took

22
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,219
place on Friday if you guys were here

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,530
I'd love your thoughts on that and yeah

24
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:19,318
it's just as interlaces a springboard

25
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,179
for getting people from different

26
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:24,450
industries like engineering design

27
00:01:21,179 --> 00:01:26,520
fashion and opening that dialogue to the

28
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,299
wider public as well when it comes to

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,539
the future of fashion hi my name is

30
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,490
Beshara and I basically have my own

31
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:38,369
studio so I've got very eclectic

32
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,779
background like probably many who were

33
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:44,549
drawn to this area so I initially

34
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:47,429
studied biochemistry and then I worked

35
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,859
in tech in finance for a long time and

36
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:52,009
then I'm just through night school I did

37
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:55,408
art classes and I switched careers into

38
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:57,479
sustainable fashion and did through

39
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,399
night school again a fashion degree and

40
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,310
I taught fashion at London College of

41
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,200
Fashion as well and then I did another

42
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,009
degree actually addicted to night school

43
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,989
and in design where I was kind of

44
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:14,069
looking at still interested in social

45
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:15,569
benefit interactivity and then I sort of

46
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:17,780
brought everything together and wearable

47
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:20,459
tech in the last few years I've been

48
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,550
freelancing and advertising but on the

49
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,670
VR side so I

50
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:26,200
on like a haptic armband to give you

51
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,420
force feedback and that kind of stuff

52
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,280
and then most recently my own project

53
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,359
which is called Dark Matter dark energy

54
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,880
which has two different sort of haptic

55
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,960
experiences but with an a VR story so

56
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:45,700
yeah you can see it on the ID understand

57
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:48,130
yeah hi I'm I'm beer Joss Khan I'm

58
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,230
originally from Istanbul but based in

59
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:54,130
New York

60
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:57,190
my background is normally in business

61
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:01,000
but I decided to change to design and

62
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:06,550
technology so I studied at Parsons at

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,710
New York and so during my master degree

64
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,140
I was really curious about wearable

65
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:13,900
technology and fashion technology so

66
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:17,049
right now I also teach at Parsons

67
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:21,580
interactive garments class so what I do

68
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:24,310
is during my teases times and I've been

69
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,930
really curious about how we can also use

70
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,240
you know wearable technology not just

71
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,250
for you know functional purposes about

72
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,370
form or you know creating more

73
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:36,310
expressive garments more you know like

74
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:38,770
dynamic garments so that's where I'm

75
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:42,940
like researching about and you know

76
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:50,440
creating garments that you know also

77
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:55,420
sense the environment so yeah I run the

78
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:58,900
sensory design lab in San Francisco the

79
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:01,030
my background is in physical therapy and

80
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,720
dance I specialize in the neuropathies

81
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:07,030
which is nervous systems and then I went

82
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,020
back to grad school for design and then

83
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:14,440
I created this I make awareness

84
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:17,230
technology now and biometric sessions so

85
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,510
I primarily work with biosensors to read

86
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:22,570
your body systems and then I translate

87
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,159
that into audio tactile or visual

88
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,020
displays and I call this ecstasy

89
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,669
externalized intimacy sharing how you

90
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,669
feel on the inside to the external world

91
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,869
somehow this has led me to now I'm

92
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:38,990
working on artificial intelligence and

93
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,990
machine learning so it's been quite a

94
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:47,910
trail I didn't think I'd end up here no

95
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,770
it's great and for for me as moderator

96
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,930
it's really interesting because each of

97
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,750
you have such a different background and

98
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,970
in terms of how you arrived to fashion

99
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,280
tech right and then with Cristina

100
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,840
obviously having the holistic view so

101
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,210
where she said she has this amazing

102
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,239
platform by which she gets to interact

103
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,710
with all these different companies so so

104
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,780
that being said I just couldn't want to

105
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,210
jump in and see you know so what are the

106
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,580
things it's you know moisturizer you're

107
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,930
creating your new designs like what are

108
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,599
some of the things that really inspire

109
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,639
you and sort of get you get you going so

110
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,780
I'd like to hear a little bit about your

111
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:28,289
perspective I think on a sort of

112
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:32,460
personal development level its fashion

113
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:35,969
tech or wearables it's a way that I can

114
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:39,380
apply all my different skills and going

115
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:41,430
ahead from that my sort of philosophy is

116
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:45,030
kind of integrating the

117
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,800
multidisciplinary so what gets me up in

118
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,719
the morning and also just naturally I

119
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,500
think I'm a storyteller so I should stop

120
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,930
rambling so what gets me up in the

121
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,990
morning is you know like throwing a new

122
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:02,729
voice in the mix of tech as well and in

123
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:11,460
in creativity and letting people feel

124
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:14,039
something new for me I because I just

125
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,530
ended up you know researching nature

126
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:20,729
because I find it so fascinating because

127
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:24,138
they have their own you know how can I

128
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:29,130
say system that already built in so I

129
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:32,940
first for my projects I've I really like

130
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:36,090
to look in like research how they move

131
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:38,640
or how they sense because we are limited

132
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:41,400
they're like amazing they already have

133
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,900
like more amazing senses so they can you

134
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,820
know sense more

135
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:50,549
the world and so whenever like I wake up

136
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:53,640
how I can you know integrate their you

137
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:56,760
know senses to our garment so you know

138
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:59,190
they can also instead of being like a

139
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:02,010
dead clothe but they can also sense the

140
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:05,010
environment so that's you know triggers

141
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:07,200
me all like all the mornings and I wake

142
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:10,830
up oh so how can I make a you know

143
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,140
jacket also like sense whenever it's you

144
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,840
know cold but you can you know get you

145
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,060
know heat it up by itself but also like

146
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,690
the technology is kind of like limited

147
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:24,810
because it's really hard to mass-produce

148
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:26,880
nowadays but yeah we can I think we're

149
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,130
gonna talk about that stuff is all but

150
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,140
for me I really like to create more

151
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,820
unique pieces because fashion is also

152
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,390
you know about that

153
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:38,400
so yeah I'm trying to combine everything

154
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:40,349
no it's great and then with your piece

155
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,270
fall that you did I mean if you guys

156
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:45,320
haven't seen her work you know it is out

157
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:47,760
in the expo her piece fall and it is

158
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,250
exactly as you articulated your sort of

159
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,010
point of view yeah the way it moves and

160
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:56,310
it has sort of these beautiful autumn

161
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:59,010
colored leaves on it yeah because I also

162
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,830
really appreciate how nature works and I

163
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:04,950
really like to put you know audience on

164
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,590
on may true perspective half days tends

165
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:10,710
you know how they you know interact with

166
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,869
you know the world so it's also nice

167
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:14,609
that we can understand their point of

168
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:21,390
view as well so we can you know create

169
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:23,760
more stuff I'm really inspired by

170
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:30,030
synesthesia it's crossing your senses

171
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:33,600
like some people here colours really

172
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:35,280
interested with that design because if

173
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:43,950
you give somebody a new sense it creates

174
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:46,260
a new kind of awareness or memory like

175
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,550
trying to is it just sort of like hey

176
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,410
I'm working with this particular thing

177
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,640
and what if I took that and I mixed it

178
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,640
with this other thing and I mean is that

179
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,840
sort of your creative process or

180
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,330
I just take three things so and then you

181
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:03,920
find the magic in the middle like

182
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:08,300
something new out of three like my work

183
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,829
is fashion healthcare and gaming that's

184
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:14,870
in between that so it doesn't exist

185
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:19,310
anywhere but it's fun to create new

186
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:21,740
ideas and puzzles and you talk about the

187
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,479
you know experimenting with AI is there

188
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:28,130
anything there that you can maybe share

189
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:31,130
with a group here it's really

190
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:36,080
interesting like because I'm I work a

191
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:37,820
lot with emotions Oh with machine

192
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:43,970
learning that we have now you can

193
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:48,320
actually get more intimate which we

194
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:50,630
couldn't do two years ago so somehow I'm

195
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,440
learning about it the machine learning

196
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:56,660
me maybe it's a cycle you're learning

197
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,420
the machine it's learning you and maybe

198
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,069
how you apply it to the design you know

199
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,540
thinking about with what you do you know

200
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:06,050
maybe it's the case of learning a

201
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:08,589
particular behavior a particular person

202
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:11,060
or personality and then perhaps how that

203
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:12,560
is reflected in the lighting and the

204
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,949
clothing that's kind of what comes to

205
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,219
mind and seeing your work how we'd see

206
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:22,130
that what what do emotions mean it's

207
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,020
very curious because I show different

208
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,120
like around the world like in Russia and

209
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:31,189
what they interpret these emotions to

210
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:32,510
mean it's so interesting gathering all

211
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,620
that data and trying to make it

212
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:37,280
meaningful and

213
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:40,910
I think the dialogues really the most

214
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,430
interesting thing and also it's so

215
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:46,520
amazing that how you bring 3d printed

216
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:48,560
with you know textile together as well

217
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,650
so you know they have this whenever the

218
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,979
person wearing it moves also you know it

219
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:57,439
gives you like another level of you know

220
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:00,740
movement as well yeah I always have that

221
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,509
like biofeedback leap yeah

222
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,339
in bushwell you've been working you

223
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:07,949
mentioned in VR and obviously you know

224
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:10,920
your latest work dark matter it has you

225
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:12,420
know the sort of VR component to it you

226
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,519
know anything you'd like to share with

227
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,589
the group in terms of like why why you

228
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,360
sort of chose that route or how you kind

229
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:21,920
of went into that direction and what are

230
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,720
you working on I think when I was

231
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,889
initially I just by chance I got a you

232
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,500
know a freelance job in VR and it felt

233
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:33,810
very apparent that at which I think

234
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,850
probably everyone agrees with that the

235
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,250
headsets have come from have been

236
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,319
developed from product from tech because

237
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:44,880
of funding you know the people who

238
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:47,430
sponsored or pay for TVs basically or

239
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,250
mobile phones have ended up on your face

240
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:52,439
so it just seemed the wrong way of

241
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:55,920
design and it's obviously very

242
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,990
utilitarian and very patriarchal all of

243
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,029
that stuff and it was just really

244
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,730
annoying me so I thought okay well first

245
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:04,680
of all this couldn't it should come from

246
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,970
the body which I think you know we're

247
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,258
coming from fashion it should come

248
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,870
design should come from the body if

249
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:14,730
you're gonna wear it not from your you

250
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:16,829
know front room so the V art said the

251
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:20,819
aesthetics of the headset was an issue

252
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:22,769
for me and then the actual you know I

253
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:25,709
looked at six and again when I went to

254
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:27,000
our conferences the guy well it variably

255
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:28,560
guys would go what are you doing haptics

256
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,139
there's no cultural reference out there

257
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,319
kind of like everything's haptic why are

258
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:39,110
you not doing it as a point of you know

259
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:42,180
experience and I'm going with this but

260
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:44,610
so it just kind of developed from there

261
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:48,870
like how can be really were how can it

262
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:50,910
be meaningful as well I you know I'd

263
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:54,209
like to add in the biofeedback in the

264
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:56,579
next version how can it be central to

265
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:59,849
the story rather than you've created the

266
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:03,000
VR film or three 360 animation or

267
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:07,589
whatever and then you add on you know

268
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,630
add on other bits and to kind of help

269
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:12,120
with that in my studio we've created a

270
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,439
software tool actually to help integrate

271
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:18,170
which I've called this sensor

272
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:21,780
vizor so you can like plug in different

273
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:24,360
say types of haptics and alongside the

274
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:26,579
sound and the film you can try and

275
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,680
synchronize it all so you can actually

276
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,780
feel so you're you're having the

277
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,030
experience that you're in the world and

278
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,829
you can feel it as well it's for the

279
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,810
developers it's for the in this because

280
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:41,280
it's in the in you know content creation

281
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:44,459
is so far so even 360 so 2d because I

282
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,319
think it sort of separately like let's

283
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:50,850
add this on and that's had been add that

284
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,380
on there was a Sony via conference and

285
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,270
there's the head of interactive music

286
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,880
there so I said to him you know you're

287
00:13:54,270 --> 00:14:00,540
really focusing on hyper real but what's

288
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,160
with the ads on holding haptics and he

289
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,349
was like I took a long time for music to

290
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,839
be considered seriously within gaming

291
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,910
because because of funding and I just

292
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,450
thought what you know these are the

293
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:13,620
people who have who have all the money

294
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:18,030
you know throwing these products out to

295
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,980
the consumers so and then Cristina from

296
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:22,020
you know from your perspective I mean

297
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,780
what what are you seeing and we talked

298
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:27,689
about yes we have ai and sort of sensory

299
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:30,480
you know we have nature in a VR and sort

300
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:32,820
of like mixing that world with haptics

301
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,230
and everything so so what is what how do

302
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,540
how do you how are you seeing this like

303
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,370
how are you distilling not only what

304
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,810
these designers or do but just it where

305
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:43,830
you sit in the world and seeing all

306
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:45,810
these different trends yeah well for all

307
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,430
of these designs that you guys described

308
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:50,969
I think it's it's really interesting

309
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:52,680
because it's a new take on all of those

310
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,600
different technologies and how they're

311
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,209
used in fashion take for example in VR

312
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,760
you know there are so many retailers now

313
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:02,760
that are doing VR experiences or 360

314
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,480
videos to to let consumers like in Mars

315
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:09,689
in a fashion show or a movie or whatever

316
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:11,820
but it kind of is more for a PR purposes

317
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:14,720
most of the time where is this you know

318
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:18,210
they like push our your your thing is is

319
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,610
VR is the main element and like you have

320
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:22,290
to experience it and like the the

321
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,810
garment is also like very well without

322
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:26,079
in terms of like how it complements the

323
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,149
VR headset

324
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:35,529
I think that that's super interesting

325
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:38,200
and to verjus designs I think the the

326
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:42,240
connection to nature is super important

327
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:45,760
and what also moon referred yesterday to

328
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,950
in in her and her talk she was you know

329
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,939
technology is supposed to people think

330
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:51,550
that technology is supposed to make me

331
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,260
feel like a robot and more like a

332
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,899
machine but actually now I feel just

333
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,939
more connected to nature and to the

334
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:01,750
world and to the earth and I think that

335
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:05,560
is that is a great way of thinking and

336
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:07,630
and in terms of how technology is also

337
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,319
so different implications for technology

338
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:15,670
in the in fashion but in in ways of

339
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:17,560
thinking I just see now it's more and

340
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:20,290
more projects starting that are

341
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:23,140
considering you know how is that more

342
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:25,420
sustainable how technology is not you

343
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,740
know because technology is people think

344
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,189
the technology is not sustainable and in

345
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,959
in and in a lot of ways it it isn't but

346
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,570
now people were trying to think about

347
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:36,430
that in a different way and and use

348
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:38,380
technology to make fashion more

349
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:40,510
sustainable so for example we were

350
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:45,010
talking with Bushra at an event in

351
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:47,200
London a few months ago and another

352
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,450
friend of ours Camille she's she's an

353
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:52,079
academic in in one of the universities

354
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:54,779
in London she's just been granted

355
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:59,500
funding from the European Commission

356
00:16:54,779 --> 00:17:01,959
that looks at how to make how to make

357
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,119
technology work for the fashion industry

358
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:08,369
and make it better

359
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:12,250
greener and I feel that like that is a

360
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:14,379
it's a great direction not just oh yeah

361
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,480
we're just doing this because we're

362
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,640
gonna get some prize and like we we can

363
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,970
because the tech exists well I think

364
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,459
that is a waste of money and time if

365
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,839
it's just a one-off thing that you you

366
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:27,640
don't you know like you do it and then

367
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,428
you're done yeah yeah almost just sort

368
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,720
of technology for technology's sake and

369
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:33,220
I mean yeah I think it's always good to

370
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,440
you know you want to experiment with

371
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,240
things but I think that maybe when you

372
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,830
want to have like a solid point of view

373
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,350
and you know then I'm curious to know

374
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:44,840
from a design perspective what would you

375
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:48,110
all think from it kind of my personal

376
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,120
point of view on it is that you know I

377
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,039
do think it's good to experiment but

378
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,629
doing it with a purpose like you know

379
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:57,260
what are you what problem are you trying

380
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:59,240
to solve or you know what point of view

381
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,559
what is the outcome you know whether it

382
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,720
be a problem or what is the outcome or

383
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,269
what are you trying to do starting with

384
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,399
that and then sort of designing the

385
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:09,850
experience or the you know the thing

386
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:12,768
right from there and then how does the

387
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:16,760
technology sort of seamlessly integrate

388
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:18,049
into there so that's sort of my point of

389
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,610
view but I'd love to hear from a design

390
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:24,100
you know from a design perspective how

391
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:29,209
you all sort of tackle new technologies

392
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:30,678
jump in anyway so I was in sustainable

393
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:34,130
fashion for a while and there's a lot of

394
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:36,019
contradictions in there and there's a

395
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,330
lots of different even within you know

396
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:41,120
the Fairtrade people would would argue

397
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,980
with the green people and then within

398
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,750
the different factions it was it is

399
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,210
quite so of political or just on on that

400
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:49,820
sense but in in terms of the design

401
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:53,570
process and technology you know

402
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:54,918
traceability that's if you if you know

403
00:18:53,570 --> 00:19:00,769
what you have and where it's come from

404
00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:02,809
then that can cover both sort of workers

405
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:06,769
rights you know which countries has it

406
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:10,610
come from and also designing the kind of

407
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:12,500
like componentized stuff so within the

408
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,750
lifecycle of the garment you can take

409
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,059
out reuse it and I mean that's that's an

410
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:21,070
issue across electronics anyway you know

411
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:24,200
it's one of its one of most polluting

412
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:26,570
industries in the world yeah and it's

413
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,760
interesting yeah I'd love to hear

414
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:30,529
everybody's perspective on

415
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,480
collaborations as we're talking about

416
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:37,419
sustainability right now so you know

417
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:40,279
everybody sure is seen the adidas polly

418
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:41,570
shoes you know that have made they're

419
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:44,539
basically shoes that are made from

420
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:47,149
recycled Nets and whatnot that have been

421
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:48,770
taken in the ocean they've received a

422
00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:49,969
lot of press and you know people seem

423
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,150
really excited that they're trying to

424
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,280
take this

425
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,870
you know this good cause and this big

426
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,120
company and like how can we do something

427
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,780
for good you know would love to hear any

428
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,360
point of views on sustainability

429
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:17,490
collaboration we've got restore points

430
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:18,629
on textiles from washing your clothes

431
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:25,740
all the lint

432
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:35,370
there's biggest polluter so eunuchs eat

433
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:37,170
waste with make everything I call it

434
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,780
emotionally durable too so you'd want to

435
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:41,850
keep it and it's collectible and all

436
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:46,820
those electronics can be taken out and

437
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:49,500
reused and you have to think about oh

438
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:54,689
like a whole environment when you're

439
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:57,270
designing like take the life cycle of

440
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,560
the design itself and then what are the

441
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,389
materials and it's interesting what you

442
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,280
said about the TechEd and really

443
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:04,470
planning for that because technology

444
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,879
moves so fast and like you're saying if

445
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,180
it's something that you really want to

446
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,950
be a collectible it's like you know

447
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,360
whether it's specific boards or whatever

448
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,220
it is that you're putting in there

449
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:19,740
sensors keeping that in mind

450
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:23,280
so it's interesting because you know I

451
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,840
teach at Parsons I really wanted to you

452
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,410
know bring fashion and you know

453
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,980
technology students together so they

454
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:32,880
kind of like start you know

455
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,220
brainstorming how they can you know

456
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,500
collaborate together because they're

457
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,620
like having different point of views

458
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,450
those fashion students don't know how to

459
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,120
use technology but they want to you know

460
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,550
create really you know interactive

461
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,560
garments but then the technology people

462
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:53,159
don't know how to integrate technology

463
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:56,970
to you know on soft textiles so that's a

464
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:59,220
really that was a really interesting how

465
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,840
can I process how to see how they you

466
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,570
know communicate with each other and you

467
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,770
know teach each other where they can you

468
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,840
know like embedded tech

469
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:09,960
ecology to garment so they started to

470
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,810
you know get more creative about it

471
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:16,140
so they you know starting to have a like

472
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:18,179
how can I say a common language so you

473
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,000
know that was you know you know it's

474
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:23,030
interesting because nowadays when you do

475
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,590
like a collaboration sometimes you get

476
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:28,410
frustrated because you you you you know

477
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:30,270
you want to like imagine something that

478
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:33,510
you want to do but then the technology

479
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:37,139
limits you but it's like pushing forward

480
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:40,440
so it's nice to see as that because I

481
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:42,870
like to you know design more how can I

482
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,060
say express expressive and performative

483
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:47,820
pieces for example it's nice to see for

484
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:50,270
example a lot of really big fashion

485
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,590
houses like Chanel or Zac Posen you know

486
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:55,800
collaborate that you know technology

487
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:57,750
people so you know they can bring a lot

488
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,240
of interactive experience to their

489
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:03,300
fashion runway show so that's what

490
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:08,010
that's my more you know interests that

491
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:10,860
see more you know pieces that you know

492
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:13,470
bring really unique experiences to you

493
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:16,679
know shows or stuff like that so it's

494
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:18,780
really it's if you know the big fashion

495
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,390
house was pushed the limit I think it

496
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:24,780
we're gonna see more stuff coming as

497
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:27,630
well I was really upset when I saw the

498
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:30,260
Met Gala last year so there was I wasn't

499
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:32,880
expecting a lot of you know crazy

500
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:35,520
interactive stuff but then when I so

501
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,270
like just you know Zac Posen did this

502
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:42,450
fiber optic dress and I think that that

503
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:44,430
was it was the IBM and yeah IBM Watson

504
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:48,300
also did a collaboration that it was

505
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:52,520
like IO IO T P so it was it was powered

506
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:55,680
by people's tweets yeah yeah exactly so

507
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,990
that there that there was the moment

508
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,420
that I realized oh I think you know it's

509
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,920
kind of like hard to do like a

510
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:05,250
collaboration with in fashion and tech

511
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,860
people so I think yeah we need to push

512
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:09,840
that I think it's interesting where

513
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:12,330
you're at in that you're doing that in

514
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,020
your class sort of you know that you are

515
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:17,639
seeing are kind of pushing it because

516
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:20,489
you know as people but at least

517
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:22,789
are going into you know companies

518
00:24:20,489 --> 00:24:24,839
they're looking for that collaboration

519
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:26,489
you certainly unlike the larger

520
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:28,549
companies they're trying to figure it

521
00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:30,869
out with different groups you know IBM

522
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:33,539
it's great they have a huge Design

523
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:35,158
Center here yeah in Austin and they've

524
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:37,919
been sort of you know they're a good

525
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,929
example of trying to celebrate design

526
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,109
and sort of bringing that the

527
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:45,719
collaborative groups together I think

528
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:47,879
the it's so awesome that you're doing

529
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:51,929
that with like in one place because the

530
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:55,349
the problem that most schools have is

531
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:57,329
this is the design and art vacuity and

532
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:59,158
fashion and this is the mechanics and

533
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:02,579
engineering and they're like miles away

534
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:04,709
so no one is no one is talking you know

535
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:07,769
across those those campuses so bringing

536
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:10,519
that in you know in education is super

537
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:13,969
important because we were on a panel

538
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:18,149
like a year or two years ago with

539
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:20,579
francesca from cute circuit and she was

540
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:25,049
explaining how they're they're one of

541
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:28,589
the first fashion tech studios I think

542
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:30,379
they started way back in 2004 and

543
00:25:28,589 --> 00:25:34,259
they've been doing interactive garments

544
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:36,629
since then and now the world has woken

545
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:38,549
up to that and they're like yeah it's

546
00:25:36,629 --> 00:25:41,189
amazing like can we do that can we do

547
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:44,668
this but actually she was saying that

548
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:47,459
it's so hard to explain how everything

549
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:48,959
should be integrated to their

550
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:51,899
manufacturers and to the people that

551
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:54,599
they work with so like it takes a lot of

552
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:57,178
time for people to start speaking that

553
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:58,769
same language either fashion writer tech

554
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:03,570
depending on what background you come

555
00:25:58,769 --> 00:26:05,729
from and then on the collaboration bit

556
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:08,249
for the sustainability part that you've

557
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:11,039
all mentioned I think it's really

558
00:26:08,249 --> 00:26:15,450
interesting that now consumers are

559
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:18,059
making choices based on the you know

560
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:19,739
what they've always been making choices

561
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:21,599
on you know what the brand represents

562
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:23,989
and what it says about them but I think

563
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,759
now it's more considered okay are you

564
00:26:23,989 --> 00:26:29,480
are you practicing what you preach for

565
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:32,179
example hmm did

566
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,190
they did a huge marketing campaign I

567
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:36,380
think it was in November and it was all

568
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:38,450
about celebrating women and there was D

569
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,360
and that kind of stuff but then people

570
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:44,120
called them out because they were like

571
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,010
okay so you're celebrating all women and

572
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,928
all consumers but actually the people

573
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:49,160
who work in your factories are treated

574
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:50,929
so badly

575
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,210
you should start thinking with that you

576
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:56,690
know um and if you know the only other

577
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:58,190
task and they Bionic Karen collaboration

578
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:00,830
I think that's awesome because they're

579
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:04,070
trying to push that thinking you know to

580
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:07,850
to the consumer and people are willing

581
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:09,530
to pay more if they know that the thing

582
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:11,389
that they're buying is going to last and

583
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:14,990
that is make a positive impact on

584
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:17,419
everyone that has been you know putting

585
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:19,100
their time and energy into making that

586
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:22,340
product I think it really makes a

587
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:25,370
difference I think with the adidas the

588
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,870
recycled poly when when I was in

589
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:29,090
sustainable fashion it was so popular

590
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:31,428
that one factory actually were and

591
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:39,559
buying in plastic bottles and recycling

592
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:41,780
them we went to a cycle more so it kind

593
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:43,639
of had the adverse effect there and with

594
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,649
these trains I think they made 7000 and

595
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,030
they're from the Maldives wastes from

596
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:49,730
the Maldives so you can see there's a

597
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:52,100
carbon footprint already you know which

598
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:55,130
does that negate the the point of it and

599
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:57,799
then and as a consumer fashion product

600
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:59,900
it's always you know it's unnecessary is

601
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:03,860
that trainer gonna end up back in the

602
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:06,770
sea so it's it's you know it's very

603
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:09,320
complex it really is I don't think as

604
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:11,450
you know as a marketing thing they have

605
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,950
a global reach and they're as you said

606
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,470
they're kind of trying to change the

607
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:18,320
behavior and these big companies if they

608
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:20,750
if they even hmm if this changed like a

609
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,980
very small percentage or you know

610
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,740
something in the contract for their

611
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:26,510
workers like payment terms it has a

612
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,580
massive impact globally much more than

613
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:31,610
even politics because they're so big and

614
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:37,280
it's just exponential like over so much

615
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:39,530
yeah let's see as far as like you're now

616
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,210
getting kind of jumping into the future

617
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:42,550
right I think we talked a lot about sort

618
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,320
of what everybody's doing

619
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,270
kind of how we see you know current

620
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,300
trends and whatnot would love to know

621
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:51,310
you know what your how you know how each

622
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,770
you know designer is seeing the future

623
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:56,169
from from where you live right so like I

624
00:28:53,770 --> 00:29:02,500
guess the immediate future being talked

625
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:04,390
about that I really from my like as a

626
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,460
designer I really want as as I said

627
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:09,160
before I really want to see more you

628
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:11,370
know interactive fashion shows I really

629
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:15,210
want to see more technology you know

630
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:19,659
integrated to you know like for example

631
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:22,210
performer performances as well so but it

632
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:24,400
needs it take like it takes a lot of

633
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:26,500
time for the collaboration for example

634
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,870
musicians with you know like technology

635
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:32,050
people are fashion technology people so

636
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:34,629
I think it requires a lot of you know

637
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:37,750
Commission's and you know funding as

638
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:39,880
well but when we get there I guess like

639
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:42,880
when people start you know putting a lot

640
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:45,880
of you know work I think it's gonna be

641
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,550
great because I I guess for example some

642
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,820
fashion houses has this idea that we

643
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:53,980
just want to do for example like bags

644
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:57,850
that just light up for now but they

645
00:29:53,980 --> 00:30:00,460
don't you know think to like the future

646
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:03,129
or how can we you know have like a

647
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,170
impact for the future or how can we use

648
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:07,600
technology rather than just lighting up

649
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:10,060
like a bags or stuff like that how can

650
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,820
we you know have like impact for nature

651
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:14,470
or to our environment as well so maybe

652
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:18,280
you know they can use technology as a

653
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:21,160
tool to you know I don't know say

654
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:23,320
something about it not just like an LED

655
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,450
back or something like that but yeah

656
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,700
create creating more purpose yeah it

657
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:31,960
sounds like it exactly and being more

658
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:41,080
vocal about that and Kristen you look

659
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:42,670
like maybe kind of like well just for

660
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,520
example in the in the put together show

661
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:47,320
the other night you know how you had

662
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:49,720
your design and sort of like lighting up

663
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,730
this state you know kind of lighting up

664
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,240
and how that's expressive it seems like

665
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:57,570
like you're already sort of there

666
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:01,820
right in your designs but from what beer

667
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:05,610
J sings the more bigger environment so

668
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:26,700
so how do you see sort of future future

669
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:29,189
in your world how do you see that or its

670
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,960
MIT and almost psychics like will be

671
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:53,280
able to communicate with each other with

672
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:53,850
the technology getting there like for me

673
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,330
- yeah

674
00:31:53,850 --> 00:32:00,290
freaking eckstein so is there something

675
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:03,360
like if I guess if you had your ideal

676
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:06,659
you know money's no issue you know

677
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,399
there's no constraints commissions

678
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:11,490
whatever you could work with anybody you

679
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:17,760
could do anything I mean have any any

680
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:23,610
ideas their wish list I guess like a

681
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:25,950
playground so I call it sensory gym but

682
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:31,370
people can come in and I was like a

683
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:36,710
fitness gym but they use these

684
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:36,709
technologies to become more aware and

685
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:46,889
I've done a couple installations but do

686
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:48,899
it it's really taking it away from the

687
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:51,270
fashion and bringing it more into the

688
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,940
environment or the surroundings that

689
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:56,160
people are having a beer that's where

690
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:59,460
you see it see it yeah in your world how

691
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:06,520
you see your future pervasive it is the

692
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:10,470
IOT because you're connected

693
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:13,120
everything and coming more self-aware

694
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:17,590
for sure how do you see what's what's

695
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,989
future world for you um I'm obviously

696
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:22,899
very interested in the census and our

697
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:25,920
sort of interpretation as well there's

698
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:29,280
some kind of low-tech illusions and

699
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:33,280
which you know which can trick your mind

700
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:34,899
so easily and kind of give you know they

701
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,360
can give you a virtual reality just

702
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:40,030
there with absolutely no tech I'll show

703
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,889
you one laser which messes with your

704
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:43,540
head so I'm kind of thinking well be so

705
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,850
nice just to have the time to pull all

706
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:49,629
that research in and work out the

707
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:53,139
absolute sort of minimum input required

708
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:56,440
from the technology to meet your own

709
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:59,890
illusion or your own leap of faith of

710
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:02,620
what reality is so that's sort of what

711
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:05,470
one aspects the research aspects of what

712
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:09,279
I'm doing or the storytelling and the

713
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:13,869
kind of I would just love more people to

714
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:17,800
be hacking I think because we just need

715
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:19,450
new rules about what's what's needed the

716
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,330
old rules aren't solving the problems

717
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:24,089
anymore I mean as you said the big IBM

718
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:26,619
is that they're looking for new ideas

719
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:30,790
and creating these collaborative spaces

720
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:32,109
even you know hubs for hackers and and

721
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:35,440
all of that but just even more people

722
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:37,929
and obviously women older younger people

723
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,840
everybody you know everyone needs to

724
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:42,220
have their voice in your I think you're

725
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,929
right there's these different pockets

726
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:45,638
right there's the incubators

727
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:47,230
accelerators you know all of these

728
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,030
different things and I think there there

729
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:51,250
are people trying to get in there but it

730
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:53,879
goes back to communication right like

731
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:56,560
how can we get the word out how can we

732
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:58,930
experiment more you know one of the

733
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,359
things often times so here I'm sure

734
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:03,580
everybody on this panel have worked with

735
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,920
both big and small companies you know

736
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:07,480
it's like hey we went to experiment but

737
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,090
we want to see who's done it first and

738
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,070
then then we'll invest in it it's like

739
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:13,840
well that's not that's not you know

740
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,230
creating the future somebody's already

741
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:19,339
done it

742
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:22,430
really safe and so I think that you know

743
00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:24,380
making helping companies understand that

744
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:27,230
it is a safe zone to invest you know

745
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:29,690
whether it be in schools the incubators

746
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:32,750
you know the designers the artists - hey

747
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:34,280
let's let's you know we're doing this

748
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:37,490
for the first time it's okay and may

749
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,619
completely fail it could be awesome we

750
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:41,328
have to be okay with that and you know I

751
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:44,570
think it I think it is interesting that

752
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:46,130
we're seeing more companies do that but

753
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:48,440
like you say it's like we need more and

754
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:51,200
we need to continue to share those

755
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,270
stories so that companies feel safe to

756
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,029
experiment so that we can create more I

757
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:58,750
think it's what you know what we were

758
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:02,089
discussing yesterday about how

759
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:05,329
technology companies first when wearable

760
00:36:02,089 --> 00:36:06,980
tech started being a thing they were

761
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:09,020
more thinking about yeah let's do the

762
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,420
tech because we can do the tech and then

763
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:13,790
it's amazing and then just slap some

764
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:15,050
design on it or like make it more

765
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:17,000
fashionable

766
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:20,359
it's like lipstick yeah like you know

767
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,030
the Google glass example with Jen for

768
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:26,509
her Sternberg collaboration it was like

769
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:28,579
yeah it didn't take off and then they

770
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:32,390
collaborated with her to create designer

771
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:34,940
frames for her glass but it was just an

772
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:37,549
afterthought rather than you know the

773
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:42,020
design and how it looks is integrated

774
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:44,690
from the start the ground up and that is

775
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:47,540
that is a challenge because technology

776
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:50,780
companies until now they haven't really

777
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:55,310
seen the arts or fashion or the word of

778
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:57,890
music the creative fields as a as a as a

779
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:59,720
credible industry almost you know and

780
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:01,279
now they are starting to realize our Wow

781
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,578
okay so we have to think about

782
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,099
everything it goes even um you know it's

783
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:09,410
all about the user experience if you

784
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:11,990
even if you're talking about a website

785
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:14,420
you know people were thinking in design

786
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:16,430
that requires design thinking it doesn't

787
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:19,640
require that much of a technology

788
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:22,910
perspective and I think it's getting

789
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,618
there but it's it's hard okay you're

790
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:27,379
you're absolutely right it is hard and

791
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:28,240
it is really it is more of the educate

792
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,440
goes back

793
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,189
you know getting the word out in the

794
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,840
education of hey you know bringing in

795
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:37,060
designers bringing in creative people

796
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:40,120
upfront and being able to say you know

797
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:42,160
the this is this is what we're doing

798
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,830
right and it's going to involve you know

799
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,200
designer here's the technical here's the

800
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:52,690
challenge or trying to do here's the

801
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:55,569
type of design or designer artist

802
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:57,700
musician etc like they're a part of the

803
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:59,740
process with the technology and kind of

804
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:02,830
like you're saying in your class right

805
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:06,490
just doing that in the world and then

806
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:08,680
it's amazing what people can create some

807
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:11,700
of the ones that might be guys I'm sure

808
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,859
are aware of it's like the sub pack

809
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:17,770
where you can feel you can actually feel

810
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:18,820
the music and they had worked with

811
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:23,620
Timbaland

812
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:25,150
a musician to create that product why is

813
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:27,279
where who's here I don't know if you've

814
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:30,220
seen them but they're working with Iris

815
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,950
Apfel and they call it the beauty and

816
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:35,680
the brains of you know designing the

817
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:37,810
product and they really had designers up

818
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,080
front working with the technologists so

819
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:44,650
they said New York what'd he call it The

820
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:46,509
Devil Wears Prada meets the nerds in San

821
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:49,990
Antonio but they had worked

822
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:52,240
collaboratively and so completely agree

823
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:53,950
like it had it cannot be an afterthought

824
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,290
and people see it like you're saying

825
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:59,290
what the glasses are like it's true I

826
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:02,800
mean it it can't just be a one-off thing

827
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:03,880
because people have to just change their

828
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,670
mindset and how they think about

829
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,850
creating those products it's not you

830
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:11,350
know we have the technology and

831
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:16,029
designers will come later on it's just

832
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:18,460
so how it works but I think on the on

833
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:20,290
the sensing point that you mentioned

834
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:23,320
it's really interesting cuz whenever

835
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:25,270
you're talking about clothes for me the

836
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,790
future is just you know it's not gonna

837
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:30,790
be called fashion tech in ten years will

838
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:33,130
be called fashion and you know it will

839
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:35,470
just technology will be integrated into

840
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:38,860
the garment and I kind of envisioned

841
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:42,049
that future but until we get to that

842
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:43,670
point it's gonna take a lot of

843
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:51,020
a lot of time and energy and some really

844
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:52,850
smart people and and on Kristin's point

845
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:56,120
I think it's really interesting when you

846
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:59,750
think about the body as a communication

847
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:02,180
to almost and letting you know whatever

848
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,950
you feel inside to be expressed outside

849
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:06,350
I think that's really really powerful

850
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:08,629
and sort of what moon was you know

851
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:12,259
making yesterday and how she's she was

852
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:15,410
telling us about her performance and we

853
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:18,410
know how is that you know what she feels

854
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:20,450
inside how she translates it like yeah

855
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:22,730
and how she's really connected to the

856
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:25,100
earth like she's connected to the earth

857
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:27,380
and then she's doing this where she's

858
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,839
also connected to outer space as well so

859
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,820
she's connected to space and Earth and

860
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,400
you know and she's a part of it and it's

861
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:36,200
just it's really interesting to see you

862
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,630
know her thinking and and and where

863
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:43,879
she's going and others obviously here

864
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:45,200
body hacking and in Kristin you know one

865
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,760
of the things was interesting that kind

866
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,040
of that stuck with me and this talk is

867
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,810
how you said you take three things you

868
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,000
know when you're designing and I think

869
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:54,590
that you know and in hearing the themes

870
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,930
in this discussion it's like three

871
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:58,970
things if companies can keep those three

872
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:02,180
things in mind and three things meeting

873
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:04,730
you know design right technology and

874
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:06,649
then whatever whatever the problem is

875
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:10,970
they're trying to solve and intersect

876
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:13,940
those could be really good I think with

877
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:18,009
the aging population it's inevitable a

878
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:21,770
lot of design will become assistive and

879
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:25,610
communicative its it has to otherwise

880
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:28,130
it's not gonna have enough purpose you

881
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:30,200
know progressed like progressively there

882
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:32,120
are neurological diseases which there's

883
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,950
no you know like dementia which there

884
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,200
are no cures it's all about how to make

885
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:39,109
the carer as best you know care

886
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:40,730
management and then for the carers how

887
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:42,380
to help them as much as possible so they

888
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:45,340
can lead a normal life if they have

889
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:49,450
someone to look after

890
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:51,820
and we're almost at time so before

891
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:53,350
before worse before we wrap up I did

892
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:56,380
want to see I'd love to spend just the

893
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:57,910
last few moments you know hit hearing

894
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,260
everybody's perspective on like you know

895
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:00,970
what are the couple things you like

896
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:03,730
everybody in this room here to take away

897
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:05,470
with them you know from our panel where

898
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:10,930
that there are the main things they can

899
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:14,169
take away with them well yeah we took

900
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:15,870
two we talked about purpose a lot so I

901
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:18,490
think that's the main thing you know

902
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:20,650
just because you can create something

903
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:23,020
with technology or even without like it

904
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:24,970
doesn't mean that you should do it you

905
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:27,660
know think about how it's going to be

906
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:29,950
used you know how it's impacting

907
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:33,879
everything around everything around you

908
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:37,870
everyone around you as well and I guess

909
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:41,380
the other thing is just shift your mind

910
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:44,799
from thinking about design or fashion or

911
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:48,610
art as of something secondary because

912
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:51,010
it's just as important and you know I I

913
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:56,260
think those are like my two main point

914
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:59,110
of view I think that everyone should

915
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:01,540
have a go and just buy the components

916
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:04,480
and go on YouTube and just start

917
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:07,150
experimenting and creating your own

918
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,740
stuff and people should collaborate and

919
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:11,350
I'm always looking for collaborators as

920
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:13,569
well so if you I'm doing another dark

921
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:15,370
matter version for your version so if

922
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:22,900
you want to get involved just give me a

923
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:25,540
shout yeah so I I have like two

924
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,870
maybe you know purposes let's say

925
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:30,700
because from my you know academic

926
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:32,529
purposes I really want you know student

927
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,990
like fashion and you know technology

928
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:37,000
students don't get afraid from each

929
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:39,100
other because you know they have this

930
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,300
you know thing that oh we cannot work

931
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:43,990
together because you know we have

932
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:46,630
different you know my set of mind that

933
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:49,899
you know because technology wise and and

934
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:52,450
fashion wise but they're like a lot of

935
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:54,460
open source tools like you can

936
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:56,799
definitely go online and you know start

937
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:59,040
learning by yourself everything if you

938
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,470
want to just you know light in LA

939
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,360
d or something it's super you know easy

940
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:05,250
so that's what I'm like trying to teach

941
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:08,400
or even like solving as well because

942
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:10,950
like technology people don't know about

943
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,200
any anything about you know fashion so I

944
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:15,750
am like trying to you know create like a

945
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,859
common language between them so and they

946
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:21,780
can keep going work you know after

947
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:24,540
afterwards like when they graduate as

948
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:28,380
well because we need a lot of people

949
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:30,000
right now that know the two different

950
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:33,210
languages so they cannot communicate

951
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:37,830
with each other but as a designer

952
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:39,720
perspective I really like to bring you

953
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:44,910
know expressive and interactive pieces

954
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:49,290
to like as I said more like showcase

955
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:51,810
wise so that's what I'm looking for and

956
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:54,000
you know pushing forward because lots of

957
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:56,340
companies you know just wanted to you

958
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,980
know as I said like an LED you know

959
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:00,540
t-shirt or something no it's not it you

960
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,880
know we can just you know push more

961
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,560
forward so you know if you have like a

962
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,780
goal or something like that instead of

963
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,750
like you know mass-produced but creating

964
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:13,110
more you know unique experiences so I'm

965
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:16,260
I'm definitely like interested in

966
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:20,790
creating you know unique experiences for

967
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:24,390
people so important what you're saying

968
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:26,160
about creating the new language yeah and

969
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:29,160
that's what we have right now this was

970
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:34,640
such a nascent field but I encourage

971
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:38,399
everybody to make it like define it

972
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:41,549
things and maybe like take three people

973
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:47,730
who have different skills like it's

974
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:50,630
designer techie and a doctor and like

975
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:50,630
just see what happens

976
00:45:52,800 --> 00:46:01,210
thank ya I'm super excited the future no

977
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:04,440
that's great and so so what I heard

978
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:08,500
there was you know purpose collaboration

979
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:10,240
experiment give it a go do that go out

980
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:14,050
and do something and create a common

981
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:18,490
language so that's uh I think those are

982
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:20,410
got a handful of things everyone great

983
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:22,089
so I guess if if you guys are good we'd

984
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:25,859
love to open it up for questions and

985
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:25,860
kind of continue the conversation yeah

986
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:55,549
in terms of the recent us sort of

987
00:46:52,329 --> 00:46:56,329
projects I did I actually took for the

988
00:46:55,549 --> 00:47:00,190
aesthetics

989
00:46:56,329 --> 00:47:02,960
I used ripstop which is widely available

990
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:04,869
because it's really sculptural and you

991
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:10,089
can you know it's just a really fun

992
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:13,430
fabric and it's waterproof as well and

993
00:47:10,089 --> 00:47:14,960
but with my engineer who I usually work

994
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:18,230
with he's doing a PhD and he's

995
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:21,079
developing a silicon which conducts

996
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:23,269
electricity so it when you know you run

997
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:24,890
high-voltage through it it can you can

998
00:47:23,269 --> 00:47:27,740
really control the voltage so it has a

999
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:29,598
really nice expansion contraction for a

1000
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:31,160
really nice haptic and apparently high

1001
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,799
voltage doesn't kill you it's the

1002
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:40,368
current so he's like I've demoed it and

1003
00:47:33,799 --> 00:47:54,859
nobody died okay so yeah that's the kind

1004
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:57,319
of material I do a lot of recycled like

1005
00:47:54,859 --> 00:48:00,710
I melt a lot of plastic which is a

1006
00:47:57,319 --> 00:48:11,690
little bit toxic always trying to figure

1007
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:14,630
out new material from I really wanted to

1008
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:17,240
you know explore more the 3d print area

1009
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:20,509
because the materials that you know my

1010
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:25,758
you know dream was how can we you know

1011
00:48:20,509 --> 00:48:28,460
em bed like conductive how can I save

1012
00:48:25,759 --> 00:48:30,740
fibers or you know conductive yarns to

1013
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:32,690
3d printed materials or sometimes so we

1014
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:35,269
can just you know 3d print however we

1015
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:37,279
would like I know there's gonna be like

1016
00:48:35,269 --> 00:48:38,899
a lot of you know limitations or stuff

1017
00:48:37,279 --> 00:48:43,549
like that but that would be really

1018
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:46,460
amazing to you know explore spiders so

1019
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:48,049
yeah yeah yeah yeah really interesting

1020
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:50,750
with you I'm not a designer but I'm just

1021
00:48:48,049 --> 00:48:53,170
gonna throw it out no did you see that

1022
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:57,079
cute circuit did used a graphene

1023
00:48:53,170 --> 00:49:01,770
uncrated dress using graphene yeah

1024
00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:37,170
nice antenna anyone else any other

1025
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:40,020
questions yeah so when I started

1026
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:42,480
interlace the we were working towards a

1027
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:45,480
similar conference and a fashion tech

1028
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:48,329
show and I didn't really know anyone in

1029
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,549
the field I've researched people but I

1030
00:49:48,329 --> 00:49:52,260
did I haven't met anyone and then I

1031
00:49:50,549 --> 00:49:55,410
started meeting up with designers and

1032
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:57,809
artists and engineers and what surprised

1033
00:49:55,410 --> 00:50:01,589
me the most was that the majority of

1034
00:49:57,809 --> 00:50:04,290
them were women and and that is a great

1035
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:06,690
thing because well you know we have an

1036
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:10,799
eye for aesthetic I would say more so

1037
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:13,290
than their guys like no offense but and

1038
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:15,869
also because coming from my background

1039
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:21,540
is marketing and business so coming from

1040
00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:24,809
that area you're used to being like you

1041
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:28,319
know not not really represented in that

1042
00:50:24,809 --> 00:50:34,260
capacity but you know when you look at

1043
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:36,930
the even conferences or other projects

1044
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:39,540
that are kind of thing in that field I

1045
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:42,598
think there's a lot of a lot of women a

1046
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:46,640
lot of smart women doing amazing things

1047
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:49,530
and I mean I wouldn't say it has

1048
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,868
impacted me in a way that oh yeah we're

1049
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:57,809
a women in tech or interested in that

1050
00:50:51,869 --> 00:51:00,690
way but I think it is it is a factor

1051
00:50:57,809 --> 00:51:03,450
that I guess before looking for now cuz

1052
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:05,849
it kind of trendy to be a feminist to be

1053
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:06,750
like a woman on the panel but that's not

1054
00:51:05,849 --> 00:51:08,849
the point

1055
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:10,390
you know I think just building on your

1056
00:51:08,849 --> 00:51:13,210
point it's kind of like

1057
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:15,250
how I've seen fashion tech evolve is

1058
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:17,770
it's just kind of been organic you know

1059
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:22,330
and it hasn't been it hasn't been like a

1060
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:24,790
thing right like okay women you can go

1061
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:28,120
into this yeah I shouldn't I think that

1062
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:31,210
it has been the case of people where

1063
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:33,339
I've seen a lot of trends is that it's

1064
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:35,350
you know there's a passion or it almost

1065
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:37,090
starts out with like in a hobbyist type

1066
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:39,190
thing or something and then there's like

1067
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:41,830
more creating more creating and it's

1068
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:44,890
like I'm seeing a common theme and that

1069
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:46,900
a lot of people in fashion tech they

1070
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:49,060
have like their day jobs that they do

1071
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:50,800
whatever their thing is and then like

1072
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:52,779
it's like almost on the side they do

1073
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,250
fashion tech and then you know as they

1074
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:57,340
do more and more they're sort of

1075
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:59,140
evolving into you know these these

1076
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:02,500
people you're hearing about so I think

1077
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:04,540
it's it's just a really I think we can

1078
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:06,700
all learn it's not about I mean at the

1079
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:08,080
end of the day you know it's not about

1080
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:13,240
oh my god you're a guy I'm not gonna

1081
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:17,680
work with you like no if just ito about

1082
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:19,799
being more open and I think what is

1083
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,690
great about this community is that

1084
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:24,820
everyone is super open-minded and

1085
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:28,390
everyone wants to collaborate and you

1086
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:30,100
don't really see that in fashion in the

1087
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:32,020
traditional sense like if you go into

1088
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:33,460
you know Fashion Week's or whatever it

1089
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:36,160
was just like oh do you know who I am

1090
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:40,210
and you know the kind of day it's they

1091
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:42,190
do have that attitude you know and an

1092
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:48,670
even though they're like we don't want

1093
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:51,190
to see wires like yeah yeah but yeah

1094
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:53,470
fashion taken that sense is such a cool

1095
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:57,280
place to be because everyone is very

1096
00:52:53,470 --> 00:53:02,799
open-minded and yeah I think when I was

1097
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:05,680
a programmer I'm 20 years ago it was the

1098
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:08,830
kite like there was a lot of sexist

1099
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:14,020
banter and I would say I've faced a lot

1100
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:16,660
more sexism than racism for sure and so

1101
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:18,310
you don't get that banter anymore that

1102
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,470
there's still obviously an attitude

1103
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:22,990
because they're decision-makers

1104
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:27,879
even within fashion or men as well as

1105
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:29,859
tech is just still that way and like I

1106
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,869
did a little film I've got a three year

1107
00:53:29,859 --> 00:53:33,910
old daughter so I was showing her it's

1108
00:53:31,869 --> 00:53:36,460
only five minutes so how a circuit works

1109
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:38,230
and I put it on Facebook and you know

1110
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:39,520
like a friend I've known for a long time

1111
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:41,590
is like oh why did you keep teaching a

1112
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,420
tech and I'm like it's just play to her

1113
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:45,880
she doesn't know the difference in the

1114
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:49,960
world like already it's gender bias you

1115
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:51,460
know so but then I think we have to like

1116
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,980
I have to carry on like we all have to

1117
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:55,210
carry on doing this stuff and just

1118
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:58,660
saying yeah it's normal it's just

1119
00:53:55,210 --> 00:54:02,830
fashion for it it's just play really you

1120
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:05,589
know because I'm originally from Turkey

1121
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:08,080
so whenever I go for like a conference

1122
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:09,670
when I got invited to you know give some

1123
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,290
talks about you know aware of the

1124
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:16,200
technology or fashion technology they

1125
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:16,200
were like do you know how to code yeah

1126
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:20,490
like why not you know I

1127
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:27,880
so because yeah so because I'm like an

1128
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,619
international designer here so not here

1129
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,780
United States but in you know like

1130
00:54:29,619 --> 00:54:34,690
Middle East people get really you know

1131
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:36,250
surprised oh so you can call it oh so

1132
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:38,890
you know you know how to you know use

1133
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:43,690
technology or something like that but

1134
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:47,129
yeah so that's why I think with current

1135
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:49,630
situations we need to definitely need

1136
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:53,349
you know this conference is more

1137
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:55,630
especially you know in Europe or you

1138
00:54:53,349 --> 00:54:57,700
know in Middle East so you know people

1139
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:59,560
can know that oh there's like this area

1140
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,060
you know going and especially for

1141
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:04,270
example Turkey because it has like a

1142
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:06,700
huge textile industry and they you know

1143
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:09,190
started to you get really excited about

1144
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:11,560
for example oh so you know we can do a

1145
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:13,290
lot of collaborations you know and we

1146
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:17,410
can push her vert you know this

1147
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:19,720
technology with textile industry more so

1148
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:21,970
it's you know really important to people

1149
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:24,848
you know about what's the future of

1150
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:28,569
textile of everything so I think yeah

1151
00:55:24,849 --> 00:55:33,540
that was my experience educate everybody

1152
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:33,540
get it like anybody can do this exactly

1153
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:46,460
gift email a couple years ago I realize

1154
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:48,470
you only get hired by women and even

1155
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:51,470
though my Studios in San Francisco I

1156
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:55,520
only make money in socialist countries

1157
00:55:51,470 --> 00:56:02,149
outside of the US so that was very

1158
00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:03,890
interesting when I had that like yeah

1159
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:06,320
I've certainly seen a lot of theory

1160
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:08,839
she I've seen a lot of change but I

1161
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:12,020
think you know there's still a lot more

1162
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:14,600
to go I kind of grew up in the digital

1163
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:17,720
marketing field and then segwayed into

1164
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:19,850
product innovation and then now it's

1165
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:23,359
kind of doing a little bit of everything

1166
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:26,359
right now it does a lot of fun but I

1167
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:28,069
think it is I I'm happy to see you know

1168
00:56:26,359 --> 00:56:30,619
that people are having a voice they are

1169
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:32,540
able to go out there I think people are

1170
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:34,460
more aware like well sure as you're

1171
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:38,540
saying like I mean I do remember sort of

1172
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:40,790
starting out and it was acceptable you

1173
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:44,060
know and some of the it was acceptable

1174
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:47,690
behavior to have the banter and in that

1175
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:49,070
type of thing now obviously it's you

1176
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:52,070
know it's kind of frowned upon or I'm

1177
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:53,330
even seeing more men you know standing

1178
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:55,310
up and having a point of view which is

1179
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:57,619
great so that's a real that's a positive

1180
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:59,330
change I've seen I will say even

1181
00:56:57,619 --> 00:57:05,690
starting out one of the challenges I

1182
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:07,340
would see women women behaving badly I

1183
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:08,900
guess like you know in the office or

1184
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,250
showing their shirt you know lifting

1185
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:23,210
their shirts up and different things

1186
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:24,830
like that and and into that point you

1187
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:27,140
know when I was sort of younger starting

1188
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:28,759
out and seeing that I was truly looking

1189
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:30,500
for a mentor I was really fortunate that

1190
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:33,320
I actually had some really great male

1191
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:36,410
mentors and they empowered me and

1192
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:38,420
supported me to kind of go out and you

1193
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:41,450
know do whatever the next thing was so

1194
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:43,670
that I think it takes it's not just the

1195
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:45,859
women my point is it takes them in and

1196
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:46,619
everybody to kind of support each other

1197
00:57:45,859 --> 00:57:48,808
and kind of

1198
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:55,490
all out the bad behavior and support the

1199
00:57:48,809 --> 00:57:55,490
good behavior any other questions

1200
00:58:53,710 --> 00:59:00,760
I I guess like my first you know answer

1201
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:03,880
would be you can I don't know you're

1202
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:06,480
familiar with shapeways but they have

1203
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:10,150
huge you know it's like a 3d print

1204
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:12,490
company that they you know print like

1205
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:14,380
custom you know 3d prints so you can

1206
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:16,720
choose your material and everything and

1207
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:20,290
they have like really huge sources as

1208
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:22,419
well online so yeah my you know answer

1209
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:27,820
would be you know check their website

1210
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:31,330
and yeah I don't know right now but yeah

1211
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:34,480
probably Shapeways first I think you

1212
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:37,259
could you could you might have a vision

1213
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:39,880
food do you say shoes you want to make

1214
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:41,200
yeah they kind of needs specific tools

1215
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,510
like if you want to work with leather

1216
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:46,060
for instance so you could I know in

1217
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:47,950
London new hat you can hire studio space

1218
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:50,470
for just a few hours for instance and

1219
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:52,839
use those tools and sometimes you have

1220
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:55,060
day like training days just for one day

1221
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:57,339
well I'd like made a leather handbag and

1222
00:59:55,060 --> 01:00:00,279
the same company you could you know

1223
00:59:57,339 --> 01:00:03,910
actually make your own shoes there and

1224
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:08,230
choose the fabric but also you can find

1225
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:12,250
old shoes and maybe take the material

1226
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:14,020
from there and you know reuse and yeah

1227
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:17,050
make do and mend or just reuse and

1228
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:18,599
recreate well that's a good point like

1229
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:21,310
even we were talking about sort of

1230
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:23,410
reusing items but it's a great way to

1231
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:25,270
see about getting a prototype and kind

1232
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:29,279
of experimenting you know with those

1233
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:29,280
excuse me existing materials

1234
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:27,250
my work is based on augmenting sensory

1235
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:30,250
processing disorder that's from ADHD to

1236
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:33,760
autism I also have a hug fest the

1237
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:36,670
response dear heart rates and the advice

1238
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:40,650
I've been given if you stay in the

1239
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:42,430
wellness industry just to avoid the FDA

1240
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:46,900
regulations because that takes a lot

1241
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:51,118
longer to do but I'm I'm very interested

1242
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:51,119
in their kind of adaptive technology

1243
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:58,540
yes similarly the first sort of gaming

1244
01:01:55,750 --> 01:02:01,270
armband used it used electro muscle

1245
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:03,190
stimulation EMS which is used in these

1246
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:06,250
fitness kind of things where you put you

1247
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:09,190
know the conductive gel and that's that

1248
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:10,869
particular product has makes a lot of

1249
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:14,170
claims that you can just watch TV and

1250
01:02:10,869 --> 01:02:21,130
get fit and so we were kind of thinking

1251
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:23,170
well if you wanted you know because we

1252
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:24,550
had funding from like government funding

1253
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:26,500
to take it to a certain level then we're

1254
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:28,630
thinking which market should it be the

1255
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:32,650
you know is there a medical claim that

1256
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:34,810
we can satisfy there and it's it takes

1257
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:37,960
so much funding to get it to that stage

1258
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:39,490
like proper millions and even it was

1259
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:41,109
just so difficult so then we thought oh

1260
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:43,118
well we can game fi it and then it's a

1261
01:02:41,109 --> 01:02:45,790
well being yeah you can just make it

1262
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:49,330
feel better but yeah it's just it's a

1263
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:51,759
barrier I think making it medical but a

1264
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:54,819
lot of a lot of funding when it comes to

1265
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:57,400
wearable tech comes from medical

1266
01:02:54,820 --> 01:03:00,520
military and Enterprise industries so I

1267
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:02,260
think that's why you know to get funding

1268
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:06,130
to do something that you want you kind

1269
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:08,530
of have to fit somewhere in that space

1270
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:11,140
like in fashion it just started being a

1271
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:13,570
thing in all those grants that are you

1272
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:16,299
talking about and and programs or you

1273
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:19,510
know they had they weren't around one

1274
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:21,790
two years ago and I guess that's why

1275
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:22,330
most of the things that we've seen so

1276
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:25,240
far

1277
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:28,569
some of them are close to medical device

1278
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:32,098
and I think the products that I've seen

1279
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:34,829
that are crossing fashion tech

1280
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:37,170
and medical and like wellness you know

1281
01:03:34,829 --> 01:03:39,539
the designer has to think about okay

1282
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:41,549
what like you know the company has to

1283
01:03:39,539 --> 01:03:44,759
consider the implications of that on the

1284
01:03:41,549 --> 01:03:46,349
consumer and it's with any device it's

1285
01:03:44,759 --> 01:03:48,690
like when Samsung was making those

1286
01:03:46,349 --> 01:03:50,309
galaxies he'd have what it didn't

1287
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:53,670
consider it's gonna explode

1288
01:03:50,309 --> 01:03:56,099
you know you have to consult with with

1289
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:56,609
the person who knows more about that

1290
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:59,549
field

1291
01:03:56,609 --> 01:04:01,890
I think I think yes taking something

1292
01:03:59,549 --> 01:04:05,749
from the studio and hacking and research

1293
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:08,339
to consumer is just so many regulations

1294
01:04:05,749 --> 01:04:10,919
whether it's medical or you know

1295
01:04:08,339 --> 01:04:13,019
whatever and I think that it's also to

1296
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,699
help you move faster I mean like the

1297
01:04:13,019 --> 01:04:17,160
advice you received in terms of the the

1298
01:04:14,699 --> 01:04:19,109
wellness or you know aspect of it at

1299
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:22,170
least you can get to market faster and

1300
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:26,369
then and then you know maybe they're

1301
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:29,339
able to see the proof and invest or help

1302
01:04:26,369 --> 01:04:31,979
evolve it you know and build from there

1303
01:04:29,339 --> 01:04:38,209
based on the regulations I think it just

1304
01:04:31,979 --> 01:04:38,209
helps get to market faster anyone else

1305
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,299
[Music]

1306
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:42,700
so um so yeah I'm not a I'm not a maker

1307
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:46,060
so I can just say what I've seen so far

1308
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:49,890
in terms of fast fashion yeah they're

1309
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:53,410
like it's still prevalent but even the

1310
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:57,009
fast fashion retailers have initiatives

1311
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:59,589
that are trying to to push in terms of

1312
01:05:57,010 --> 01:06:01,240
sustainability like H&M is a big one

1313
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:04,540
they have a sustainability prize every

1314
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:08,350
year and like Zara is making all of

1315
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:12,250
their like the latest collection is so

1316
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:15,490
like sustainable and everyone's trying

1317
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:18,340
to push in that direction but in terms

1318
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:19,649
of consumers communicating that is the

1319
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:21,880
most important thing you know those

1320
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:24,310
campaigns that we've seen do happen once

1321
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:26,859
a year so you talk about them like once

1322
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:29,560
a year and then it's like yes but

1323
01:06:26,859 --> 01:06:31,029
there's a really cool company based in

1324
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:33,790
San Francisco actually it's called ever

1325
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:38,670
Lane you guys have heard of it and what

1326
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:42,160
they do is they they create high-end

1327
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:46,510
basics so like t-shirts and pants and

1328
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:51,250
shoes but how they do that is they let

1329
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:53,680
the consumers see what exactly went into

1330
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:55,510
and making that garment and how much

1331
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:59,230
does it cost on their website so for

1332
01:06:55,510 --> 01:07:02,590
example you can take you can say to make

1333
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:05,500
this shirt we and the cost of materials

1334
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:08,080
was this much the cost of shipping are

1335
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:12,070
paying the workers and like design work

1336
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:14,590
and then in total let's say it's $10 and

1337
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:16,270
if and they also show you what is the

1338
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:19,990
mark-up that they're making they're like

1339
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:22,090
we're marking it you know twice the

1340
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:24,459
price so we're gonna charge you $20 for

1341
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:27,310
that t-shirt and then you can also

1342
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:30,730
compare it to how what's the difference

1343
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:33,070
if you say if you buy that same t-shirt

1344
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:36,340
with the same quality from a retailer

1345
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:38,740
like cause or any of those you know on

1346
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:40,990
that range so the other retailers the

1347
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:44,259
mark-up is usually eight times

1348
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:46,660
and you can just see also the factory

1349
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:48,010
where it was made and what are the

1350
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:49,750
conditions for the workers and all that

1351
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:53,170
kind of stuff so they've really they've

1352
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:54,970
really taken off because the founder I

1353
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:57,940
think he comes from a financial

1354
01:07:54,970 --> 01:08:00,490
background and he wasn't really trying

1355
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:03,519
to go into fashion at all and it was

1356
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:07,589
like his strategy for whatever he ended

1357
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:10,538
up doing which was just fashion randomly

1358
01:08:07,589 --> 01:08:13,269
he was he was saying that we're not

1359
01:08:10,539 --> 01:08:15,220
trying to to scream that oh yeah look

1360
01:08:13,269 --> 01:08:16,899
we're sustainable and we think about you

1361
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:19,299
know what goes into our fabrics and we

1362
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:22,809
also inform people which was about I

1363
01:08:19,299 --> 01:08:24,580
just want to make I want to be radically

1364
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:25,960
transparent with people and I want to

1365
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:27,908
educate them so that they can make

1366
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:30,850
informed decisions so I think that is a

1367
01:08:27,908 --> 01:08:35,108
really really good strategy and they're

1368
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:37,529
quite famous for not doing sales in the

1369
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:42,219
traditional sense so whenever they have

1370
01:08:37,529 --> 01:08:44,710
whenever they have a sale basically you

1371
01:08:42,219 --> 01:08:47,589
can choose your price for the product

1372
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:50,408
that you're paying if you if say you

1373
01:08:47,589 --> 01:08:51,969
want to buy the t-shirt you can pay you

1374
01:08:50,408 --> 01:08:53,349
can choose like three different options

1375
01:08:51,969 --> 01:08:55,719
so the first one will be like ten

1376
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:57,909
dollars and they would say these $10

1377
01:08:55,719 --> 01:09:00,130
cover only the cost of making this

1378
01:08:57,908 --> 01:09:02,858
t-shirt and nothing else if you pay like

1379
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:04,929
fifteen it was like this this this

1380
01:09:02,859 --> 01:09:07,870
amount will cover the cost for

1381
01:09:04,929 --> 01:09:09,489
production and it will pay better for

1382
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:11,318
the workers in the factory and then if

1383
01:09:09,488 --> 01:09:14,528
you pay like twenty twenty dollars it

1384
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:16,839
would be this does everything that the

1385
01:09:14,529 --> 01:09:18,400
fifteen dollar does but it also lets us

1386
01:09:16,839 --> 01:09:18,908
invest in the business and make it

1387
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:21,670
better

1388
01:09:18,908 --> 01:09:22,839
so I think that is a you should look at

1389
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:24,969
them of it they're really really

1390
01:09:22,839 --> 01:09:26,620
fascinating they kind of they say that

1391
01:09:24,969 --> 01:09:29,310
they operate they could take company

1392
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:32,620
more than that is in beta who's always

1393
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:33,790
evolving I think I agree with Christina

1394
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:35,769
in the sense that it is about

1395
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:38,080
transparency because especially the big

1396
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:40,029
companies who are the fast fashion

1397
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:43,960
companies a lot of the time they don't

1398
01:09:40,029 --> 01:09:47,080
know like past two tiers of their supply

1399
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:49,179
chain and you probably understand about

1400
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:51,100
the subcontracting and that's why even

1401
01:09:49,179 --> 01:09:54,130
if they have loads of auditors it ends

1402
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:57,010
up they ends up end up with all these

1403
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:59,770
abuses of workers rights and and that's

1404
01:09:57,010 --> 01:10:03,100
got you know separate to the landfill of

1405
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:03,489
clothes from buying new stuff all the

1406
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:07,140
time

1407
01:10:03,489 --> 01:10:10,570
but it is like knowledge is empowerment

1408
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:14,679
and I think people are becoming a lot

1409
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:16,480
more informed and it is affect you know

1410
01:10:14,679 --> 01:10:19,270
as you said there are companies now who

1411
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:22,000
are making a profit who don't have to

1412
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:28,390
exploit the consumers and the workers

1413
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:30,820
I am hopeful yeah I agree with the

1414
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:32,890
approach that ever lanes doing it is it

1415
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:35,530
is about really just being transparent

1416
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:37,630
open with consumer and like you like

1417
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:40,330
their hope they hold your hand along the

1418
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:41,980
process which is nice

1419
01:10:40,330 --> 01:10:45,280
the one thing you talked about was sort

1420
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:46,989
of on-demand printing and I think that I

1421
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:48,370
think it's gonna be really interesting I

1422
01:10:46,989 --> 01:10:50,349
think it's it's kind of like with

1423
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:52,390
anything right so if they have if

1424
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:55,570
they're setting up locations and perhaps

1425
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:58,300
it's like educating consumers and having

1426
01:10:55,570 --> 01:11:00,969
a shop where people can you know pick up

1427
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:03,250
they can actually design it and go and

1428
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:04,860
pick it up and they know what's involved

1429
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:07,239
in that process and how much they are

1430
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:10,239
saving you know the environment or

1431
01:11:07,239 --> 01:11:11,980
transportation or you know what their by

1432
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:14,889
doing that what are the benefits to the

1433
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:16,269
environment and workers etc so if it

1434
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:18,880
just goes back to education and I think

1435
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:22,210
that a combination I don't think I don't

1436
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:26,100
think you know that's the solution I

1437
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:26,100
think it's it's a piece of it right

1438
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:35,919
anyone else I think we went over time

1439
01:11:29,949 --> 01:11:38,650
but this is really a great question okay

1440
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:43,090
think thank you guys

1441
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:43,089
[Applause]
