1
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:11,539
so hi everyone my name is Sydney Simon

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,940
I'm one of the cofounders of neurotic X

3
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:15,649
we're a nonprofit organization that's

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,509
building an international network to

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,419
facilitate the advancement of neural

6
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:22,250
technology essentially what we do one of

7
00:00:20,419 --> 00:00:23,810
the pillars of our organization is we'd

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,460
like to do community building in the

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,288
field so we like to bring people

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,880
together they're enthusiastic about the

11
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:30,740
domain whether you're just someone off

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,440
the street or you're doing your masters

13
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,960
or PhD in the domain we allow for you to

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,879
come together and collaborate we set up

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,979
small chapters across the world so you

16
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:41,419
can actually get connected locally the

17
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:43,640
majority of our chapters are in North

18
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:48,530
America and Europe but we also have one

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,549
in Lima Peru as well as in Israel so

20
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,019
some of the things that we do with an

21
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,540
organization we do a lot of networking

22
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:54,979
events we'd like to learn together as

23
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,540
well too so we build a lot of

24
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:59,000
educational content for you to learn

25
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,250
about neuro technology we also like to

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,150
build projects primarily open source and

27
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:06,320
we'd like to grow together so here's

28
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,189
some pictures of some of the events that

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,309
we've done in the past

30
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:12,288
on the left there see if this works on

31
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,479
the on the left there that's me at the

32
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:18,679
Tribeca Film Festival we were doing a

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,689
talk or a booth around tDCS so doing

34
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:22,579
brain stimulation on myself for two days

35
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:24,499
for about like 20 minutes at a time

36
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:26,359
wasn't really fun I had a bunch of red

37
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:28,249
marks on my face afterwards but it was

38
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:29,809
still a pretty cool experience on the

39
00:01:28,249 --> 00:01:31,399
right there that's us at the Montreal

40
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,880
Neurological Institute which is one of

41
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:36,619
the larger neurology centers in Canada

42
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,149
on the left this was something off of my

43
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:40,729
bucket list we were able to do an event

44
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:43,219
at the MIT Media Lab and we're talking

45
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:44,630
about EEG SBC eyes and on the right this

46
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:47,960
is an event that we did in Toronto with

47
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,880
one of our partners interaction so

48
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,639
neural technology tends to fall under

49
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,130
two broad categories there's more to it

50
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:57,009
as but you know the easiest way to think

51
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,240
about it is that it either falls under

52
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:01,789
neuromodulation units or neural imaging

53
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,229
devices neuromodulation is essentially

54
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:05,090
any form of Technology that has some

55
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:07,100
form of stimulant to the brain to either

56
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,259
affect behavior or cause some form of

57
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,850
physical effect to occur so I have a

58
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:13,730
couple of examples of neuromodulation

59
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:15,650
devices on the left that's transcranial

60
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,450
magnetic stimulation it uses magnetic

61
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,860
stimulation to stimulate the brain and

62
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,988
then on the right you have tDCS

63
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,500
transcranial direct current stimulation

64
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:27,660
and this technology uses a small amount

65
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,390
of amperage to about two milliamps and a

66
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,129
9-volt battery to affect behavior

67
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,958
depending where you place the electrodes

68
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:35,459
this technology in terms of

69
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,500
neuromodulation is probably one of the

70
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,239
cheapest out there you can actually make

71
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,120
your own for about twenty dollars if you

72
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,549
decide to do it in terms of neural

73
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,549
imaging it is as it sounds it's

74
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:48,930
technology that can make images of

75
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:50,099
what's happening inside the brain it can

76
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,890
visualize what's happening on the brain

77
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:54,959
so probably each one of you will get an

78
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,059
MRI at one point in your life on the

79
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,360
left there and then you have eg or

80
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,500
electroencephalography EEG is the

81
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,120
technology that we're the most

82
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,769
interested in within our own community

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,750
because of the fact that it's so cheap

84
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:08,880
and because it's so accessible

85
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,560
most people are not comfortable with the

86
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,849
idea of doing PVCs

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,610
but most people are comfortable with

88
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:17,310
just measuring their brain activity it's

89
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,290
never heard of eg the simplest analogy

90
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,450
to use to think about it it's like a

91
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,310
volt meter for your brain so it's major

92
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,319
measuring the change in voltage that

93
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,790
naturally occurs in the brain itself but

94
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,399
try and get some insight as to what is

95
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,769
happening the technology has been around

96
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,079
for a very long period of time even goes

97
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:37,889
back in its earliest forms to like the

98
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:40,590
late 1800s this is a technology most

99
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:42,959
part was only limited to researchers

100
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,109
being able to get access to it because

101
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,930
if it's really high cost so a lot of the

102
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:50,489
research grade fees that are out there

103
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,590
usually started around thousand dollars

104
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:55,440
and they easily go up to a hundred

105
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,720
thousand dollars fortunately though in

106
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,209
the past ten years we started to see the

107
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,250
emergence of consumer grade EEG s so

108
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,470
this is products these are eg products

109
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:08,069
anyone can get their hands on as long as

110
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,420
you have a minimum of $100 and maybe a

111
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,548
maximum of around eight or nine hundred

112
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,958
dollars and this is really really

113
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:15,720
revolutionary for a bunch of different

114
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,200
reasons you've also started to see the

115
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,910
rise of DIY and open source EEG as well

116
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,560
- so for people that were actually

117
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,450
interested in learning how to build

118
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,860
their stuff themselves people hard to

119
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,390
put the schematics and the building

120
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,030
materials online so you can actually

121
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:32,340
create it and the beauty of open source

122
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,929
G which many researchers

123
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,539
don't think is true but you know we've

124
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,980
done some small analysis as a community

125
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,979
what you can actually show is that

126
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,150
making open-source eg can in fact you

127
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,710
can actually build devices that are

128
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,659
better than some of the research great

129
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,539
devices that are out there so on the

130
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,130
left here this is Alexander Sean he's

131
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,680
one of the members of our community and

132
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,690
he built something called the Aleks EEG

133
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,580
and it's probably for about a building

134
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,889
materials so it cost him about two

135
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,539
hundred dollars to maybe make it but his

136
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:01,949
system if you compare it to some of the

137
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,270
research great devices out there that

138
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:04,470
are like twenty thousand dollars and

139
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,940
even some of the consumer devices that

140
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,530
are out there it's actually more

141
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,090
accurate to being able to measure

142
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,700
certain different types of brain

143
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:16,200
responses so I kind of have a graphic

144
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:18,150
initial number the higher it is in terms

145
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,060
of accurately predicting a certain type

146
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,400
of brain response so what we do with EEG

147
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,380
there's a bunch of different use cases

148
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,840
that you can actually accomplish with it

149
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,289
you can use it as a meditation aid so

150
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,250
interaction out of out of Toronto they

151
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,610
built the muse

152
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,350
they use it as a meditation enabler so

153
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,479
they help they put this edge on your

154
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,460
head it measures your elephant I think

155
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:44,760
theta ratio to determine how relaxed you

156
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,469
are you could do things that are a

157
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,210
little bit more silly like brain

158
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,770
controlled races so some of our

159
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,630
community members out of the University

160
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,299
of Florida they did a brain controlled

161
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,650
race using EEG

162
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,320
you can also do things that are simple

163
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,090
like a BCI speller or EEG speller so by

164
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,430
looking at a letter flashing at a

165
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,799
specific frequency the EEG can pick it

166
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,349
up and then it could type it out so this

167
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,729
might not be a viable application for

168
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:10,440
most of us because the typing is really

169
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:12,120
slow but for people that are

170
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,039
quadriplegic and have limited motor

171
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,870
abilities this provides a really really

172
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,479
great opportunity simply because they

173
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:20,099
cost the technology is so cheap the

174
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,130
things that I'm the most interested in

175
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:25,680
scene world is cheaper diagnostics using

176
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:28,650
this technology so what is happening

177
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,000
here this is a product that essentially

178
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,039
what it does is that measures the impact

179
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,690
of some form of physical force to the

180
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,940
brain I can't tell you if you have a

181
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,590
concussion or not but I can tell you the

182
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,360
impact that the physical force did have

183
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,010
on the brain so that you can then decide

184
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,050
if you want to do a more complicated

185
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,770
surgery procedure to measure if you do

186
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,030
have a concussion

187
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,109
for example

188
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,820
so because of the fact that this

189
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,290
technology has become cheaper in the

190
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,930
past ten years and you also have people

191
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,820
like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg that

192
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,820
are starting to invest heavily into the

193
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,110
vein as well well a lot of people start

194
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,840
to realize that there's a lot of real

195
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:04,330
financial opportunities to go along with

196
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,929
it which is a good and a bad thing in

197
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,330
its own way

198
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,880
so here's a list of all the crowdfunding

199
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,169
campaigns that have come out since 2012

200
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,050
it's not a complete list but it kind of

201
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:16,150
gives you an idea of what people are

202
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,500
trying to solve and you can see that

203
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,799
there is actually a lot of money that

204
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,900
could be minimum it seems like most of

205
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,910
them are raising close to about $100,000

206
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,500
and you have some people that are even

207
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,840
making about one I think the maximum

208
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:32,950
there is 1.9 million dollars through

209
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,710
their product so this is great I love

210
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:38,830
seeing if you'll grow unfortunately

211
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,870
though one of the side effects of this

212
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:44,050
new popularity is you're starting to see

213
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,610
a new snake oil coming to the market

214
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,230
you're seeing people that are building

215
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,860
products that actually have no viability

216
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:52,630
associated with it this is my favorite

217
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,520
example of products when it

218
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:56,740
comes to neuro technology it's called

219
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,840
the elf summit elf I'm sorry

220
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,540
they about two hundred thousand and

221
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,700
what's it supposed to be doing is it's a

222
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,460
magnetic coil that goes behind your head

223
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,409
and it's supposed to introduce some form

224
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,799
of magnetic stimulation to help either

225
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:13,990
make you relax or become more focused if

226
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,930
you're an electrical engineer engineer

227
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,790
you may notice a flaw they're using the

228
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,060
audio jack to try and pull power out of

229
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,770
it

230
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,419
you can't actually really pull enough

231
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:25,210
power out of an audio jack to do

232
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:26,799
all with so the whole design is flawed

233
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:30,010
from the very beginning regardless of

234
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,770
the science at make another

235
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:35,140
product that also made a lot of waves is

236
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,030
the no more wolf essentially it was an

237
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:41,289
EEG that could be put on your dog and

238
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:42,819
they had a small like speaker that was

239
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:44,860
attached to it so that you can

240
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,960
understand what your dog is trying to

241
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,940
say or what your dog is thinking about I

242
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:53,680
have some comments on the right there of

243
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:55,480
some of the on the YouTube video that

244
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,219
the where that was showing this product

245
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,920
and it seemed like a lot of individuals

246
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,350
were actually really excited about it

247
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,969
that's a dud it doesn't work and there's

248
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,009
many reasons why didn't it work beyond

249
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,129
its design but there was no real

250
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:10,779
scientific validation to actually back

251
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:12,959
up their claims and so the company

252
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:15,670
folded I think within a year afterwards

253
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,378
so why are people so easily fooled by

254
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,628
pseudoscience there's many different

255
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:20,980
reasons you can go on Wikipedia find a

256
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:23,290
bunch of different cognitive biases that

257
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,199
occur look into clustering illusion

258
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,579
confirmation bias etc etc but the main

259
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:29,829
reason is because people don't actually

260
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:33,519
take the time to understand or you know

261
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:35,439
validate any said so what I would like

262
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,269
to propose for the audience if you

263
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:39,579
yourself are interested in either buying

264
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:41,350
one of these products or making one of

265
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,388
them I'd like you to take these five

266
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,879
points into consideration to ensure that

267
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:49,869
what you're creating is pickled or what

268
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:51,730
you're buying is ethical number one make

269
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:53,859
sure that any product that you're either

270
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,470
trying to or make has some clay

271
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:57,579
validated claims a lot of people I've

272
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,040
been working in field of neuroscience

273
00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:01,988
using EEG there's a lot of research

274
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,519
that's already been done out there take

275
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:05,980
the time to go on Google Scholar and

276
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,889
look it up make sure that the research

277
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:14,470
that is being used to prove the validity

278
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:17,169
of system is peer-reviewed all right

279
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,939
there we go number two make sure that

280
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:22,899
the team that's building it has is the

281
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:25,149
appropriate team at a minimum have a

282
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:29,019
computer or electrical engineer a soft

283
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:33,369
developer neuroscientist related

284
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:35,230
experience no make sure you're conscious

285
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:36,999
of the pricing so think about what the

286
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,649
actual building material is how

287
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:40,809
expensive it is actually to make it and

288
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:43,689
take that in consideration as to what

289
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:45,249
the final price is when it comes to any

290
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:46,719
form of biotechnology there's a lot of

291
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:48,669
people that are out there that are very

292
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,959
desperate for their own solutions to

293
00:10:48,669 --> 00:10:51,699
solve different elements that they're

294
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:53,378
experiencing so they're willing to

295
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:56,169
actually pay a premium but for me

296
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:58,149
obviously that's unethical

297
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:59,859
number four be transparent to the risk

298
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:01,629
anything that you're doing to the brain

299
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:04,179
has some inherent risk associated with

300
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:05,649
it some device is less than others but

301
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:07,329
you know make sure that it's clear that

302
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:11,350
if there is a risk make sure to point

303
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:13,729
that out and number five as the elf

304
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,870
Emmett product suggests

305
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,510
you can actually validate your

306
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,760
technology so what they created as a

307
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,720
product the design was not very good so

308
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,730
make sure you can actually provide

309
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,290
evidence for that in different ways

310
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:28,279
either by getting certifications or

311
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:29,510
warranties as the final point for the

312
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:31,010
entrepreneurs in the crowd that do

313
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:33,139
decide to get involved in the field of

314
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,720
neural technology what I do ask for each

315
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:37,459
of you is try to solve real problems

316
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,639
don't just go for the easy money when I

317
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:42,260
was showing the list funding campaigns

318
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,399
that people have done most of the

319
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,110
problems that they're actually solving

320
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,510
were first world it's not something that

321
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,040
most people need as a product honestly

322
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,500
and I'm saying this as an enthusiast of

323
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,719
neural technology there are other things

324
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,420
that you can actually actually have a

325
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,180
much bigger impact so the kind of give

326
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,800
you some inspiration epilepsy is a

327
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,839
disease that affects 50 million people

328
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,469
worldwide with 80% of people in

329
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:08,750
developing countries actually having it

330
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:11,209
there is great opportunities to use EEG

331
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,529
to actually build low-cost solutions so

332
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:14,388
that we can actually deploy them in

333
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:16,160
places that may not necessarily have the

334
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:20,029
resources to get the more expensive

335
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,500
devices so think about your humans your

336
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:23,000
fellow humans think about your neighbors

337
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,269
when you're going out there and you're

338
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,410
trying to make an impact in the world

339
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:28,819
with that if you are interested in

340
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,959
learning more about nanotechnology you

341
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:31,969
can always go to our open source

342
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:33,619
platform called neuro tech edu where you

343
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,779
can find more resources to help you get

344
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,910
started and if you are interested in

345
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:52,000
joining our community go and go to neuro

346
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:52,000
tech XCOM thank you I do question the

347
00:12:53,290 --> 00:13:02,660
think device the o think yeah I have a

348
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:04,609
personal experience with it well it's my

349
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,250
relationship with tDCS has always been

350
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,230
varied so you know certain cases you do

351
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,880
feel something but I never really took

352
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,709
the time to validate whether it was a

353
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,990
placebo effect or was an actual impact

354
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:17,869
when I did do to think I've done to

355
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,310
think maybe four or five Pines and I did

356
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,769
notice an improvement in my

357
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:26,170
concentration but more data needs to be

358
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:26,170
collected yeah

359
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,089
you can do that from a pre-processing of

360
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,550
the EEG signal so it's quite obvious

361
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:37,710
when you have like EMG that's occurring

362
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,839
in the EEG it's like a big spike in

363
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:50,940
activity so there's standard processing

364
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:57,200
two ways that you can do any what I'm

365
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:57,200
not really sure okay thank you thank you

366
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,970
so I use a lot of different scanning

367
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,130
technologies you saw a simple handheld

368
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:07,260
scanner this is structured light

369
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:11,130
scanning which is kind of overkill also

370
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:13,050
use laser scanning booths this is body

371
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:15,660
labs up in New York they have a whole

372
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:18,209
system for analyzing body data and

373
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,880
organizing it so when you do that you

374
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:22,530
can output just simple data so if you're

375
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,120
going to talk about that quantify itself

376
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:27,000
you're gonna boil everything down into

377
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,820
just a handful of values and right now

378
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,070
in fashion and wearable technology they

379
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:35,640
use those simply to adjust 2d patterns

380
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:37,410
in a very kind of simplistic way and so

381
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,720
that's pretty basic if you move on from

382
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:42,209
there these are measurements that are

383
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,410
actually curved around the body you can

384
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:46,010
think of the body as two-dimensional

385
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:49,290
surface in three-dimensional space and

386
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:50,970
so the designs I'm making I have depth

387
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,069
to them they're not unfolded or

388
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:55,860
flattened although that is possible if

389
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:58,890
you're working with textiles but I'm

390
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,480
usually just doing a NURBS curve you

391
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:02,580
know it's the type of 3d modeling on the

392
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,260
body and what I found out very quickly

393
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,050
was that if you're making anything

394
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,180
mechanical or complicated or has many

395
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,550
parts you're gonna need to separate

396
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,260
things out into layer it's kind of like

397
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:16,050
Photoshop and what you can do is you

398
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,930
think of the body having a direction

399
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:21,300
perpendicular to the skin and just like

400
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:24,270
layers of clothing and that was really

401
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,560
helpful in separating out not just how

402
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,720
things are going to mechanically fit

403
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,650
together but I realized that that has

404
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,960
implications for the function and so I

405
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:36,090
was originally using that to predict

406
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,120
mechanical collision as a body moves

407
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:39,630
around and animates if something's

408
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,800
projecting

409
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,330
off the body you need to know if it's

410
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,120
gonna hit something else I hate your own

411
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:47,430
body and so that analysis was used for

412
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,990
that originally but as I began to

413
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,609
integrate electronics and more

414
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:54,540
complicated structures I realized how

415
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:55,770
important that idea was so what you saw

416
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,490
there was the data collection this is

417
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,650
the output

418
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,410
we're amusing 3d printing almost all

419
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:04,319
this is laser centered nylon which is

420
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,520
fairly flexible there's also in some of

421
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,830
the more advanced pieces there's

422
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,560
thermoplastic elastomer which is fairly

423
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:12,420
soft you know sometimes when you read

424
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,119
about these things online people claim

425
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,709
that they're using PLA or something like

426
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,080
that I've never met a professional

427
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:21,240
designer that has done anything like

428
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:24,120
that that's basically blogger is looking

429
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,830
at pictures and guessing this is laser

430
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,080
centered nylon and thermoplastic

431
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:29,760
elastomer works out pretty well some of

432
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,620
those pieces fully enveloped the body

433
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,220
and you can move around freely not a

434
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,500
problem

435
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,080
although you know ideally we would use

436
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,420
aligning simply because even bio

437
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:42,870
friendly and hypoallergenic polymers are

438
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:45,180
just not ideal so this is not clothing

439
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,580
these are basically frameworks for

440
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,859
fashion and art pieces but I'm moving

441
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:54,690
toward using them as casing for

442
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:57,030
electronics and so the idea that I got

443
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:59,220
in response to people was well they

444
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:01,620
actually want clothing and that has been

445
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,030
tried many times basically the issue is

446
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,859
set at two or three millimeters this

447
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:06,389
material is great when you shrink it

448
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:09,659
down to try to make it into something

449
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:11,970
more flexible or woven the granularity

450
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,500
of it and the amorphous structure of the

451
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,240
polymer just breaks down almost

452
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,890
immediately if you flex that back and

453
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,290
forth a few times it falls apart

454
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:22,410
and that's kind of obvious to anyone who

455
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:25,170
knows how fibres work but for about five

456
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:27,449
years this was a drum beat in three

457
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:29,550
printed clothing that that it was

458
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:31,680
possible and now people are finally kind

459
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,570
of taking a step back from that and

460
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,250
going in different directions and I'm

461
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,950
gonna kind of integrate that into the

462
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,900
talk so yes you can also flatten things

463
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,700
out and use that data to drive a

464
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,680
two-dimensional pattern if you like

465
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,630
there's special software for that

466
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,490
I don't specialize in that because it's

467
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:52,380
been figured out it's already 20 years

468
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:53,520
old so in moving from just visual things

469
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,040
to functional things

470
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,020
this open BCI stuff you saw in the

471
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:01,409
previous neuro tech X talk I designed

472
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:03,930
this headset with Connor this is made of

473
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:06,600
cheap desktop printed plastic because

474
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:08,010
the idea is it's a research platform it

475
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,959
has to be able to do all kinds of

476
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:12,090
different prototyping things yes it

477
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,540
looks silly but it's not really supposed

478
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:17,820
to be a stylish thing not to mention

479
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:20,190
most of the people using this are PhD

480
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,470
students studying neuroscience they

481
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,750
actually want to look like a mad

482
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:27,060
scientist to their roommate they it's

483
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:31,560
completely fitting with my market it

484
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:33,750
it's perfect so um but I'm an industrial

485
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,730
designer so I do have an aesthetic sense

486
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,220
and I've created some more aesthetically

487
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:41,490
pleasing designs that are still the very

488
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,110
complicated array of 1020 nodes most of

489
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,060
the consumer products you see just have

490
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:48,020
three or four sensors and there's a

491
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:50,520
limit to what you can do with that still

492
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:52,770
this is what we ended up kind of a

493
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,460
compromise it has some aesthetic value

494
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:58,379
if you're into that kind of thing that

495
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,940
system was expandable so all of this is

496
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,610
a modular system you can print at home

497
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,890
and adjust replace the electrodes and

498
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:07,500
things like that I do have a little bit

499
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,120
of vision forward with that just trying

500
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,440
to use it in different contexts it's

501
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,620
still gonna look pretty out there no

502
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,160
matter what you do I do have some more

503
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:18,689
consumer-friendly things but it all is

504
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,380
brutally functional and not so much

505
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:25,260
aesthetically pleasing so other than the

506
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,880
aesthetics to actually have functional

507
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,770
electronics you carry around with you

508
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,750
everything has to be durable and

509
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,810
functional and right now it's pretty

510
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,160
easy to make something you can show in a

511
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:36,840
fashion show or a demo or something like

512
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,760
that but to have something that people

513
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,980
wear everyday and it doesn't end up in a

514
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,310
drawer or broken almost immediately it's

515
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,080
pretty hard and so in thinking about

516
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:48,030
this there have been a number of

517
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,100
proposed solutions the big one that you

518
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,050
hear most of all is that everything

519
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,639
should be integrated into clothing

520
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:55,830
because clothing is already a mature

521
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,290
technology something like thirty

522
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:00,179
thousand years of development and it's

523
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,790
really really efficient I mean you

524
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:05,460
little biological machines convert

525
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:07,320
sunlight into fiber and that's it like

526
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,450
it's so simple and it's

527
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,639
so very inexpensive you can buy t-shirt

528
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,620
for $5.00 and dresses and shirts and

529
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,800
things for 20 so you compare that to a

530
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:19,590
3d printed dress or whatever that it's

531
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,320
$10,000 and breaks almost immediately

532
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:24,840
it's a tough argument to make that that

533
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,120
is better than what we already have so

534
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,800
the idea that you often hear is let's

535
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,929
put the electronics into our clothing

536
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,820
and I've considered this very closely

537
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,950
and I think there are some contexts

538
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,260
where that makes sense but they're

539
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:41,370
pretty narrow and there's actually a

540
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:42,870
wider range of solutions and no single

541
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,790
one is the correct solution they

542
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:47,280
actually kind of work together and so

543
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:50,310
the way I arrived at this is by looking

544
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,790
at four different layers basically

545
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:55,620
arranging those in a direction

546
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:57,870
perpendicular to the skin the closest

547
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:01,229
most intimate one being an implant above

548
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:03,209
that being layers that don't move that

549
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,880
are locked to the skin and that could be

550
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:07,350
either something kind of like yoga pants

551
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,960
or it could be a patch that has

552
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:12,990
electronic modules in it which i think

553
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,000
is probably going to be huge in the next

554
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:18,270
few years I'll come back to that what I

555
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,910
call the dynamic layer textiles fall

556
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:22,530
into that category reason is you want

557
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,420
them to have some drape and you want

558
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,910
them to be able to move otherwise it's

559
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,890
really not that comfortable and the

560
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,570
problem with putting electronics in that

561
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:33,630
as a wearable technology is that it

562
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:35,610
constantly moves around so those EG

563
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:38,190
systems we had if you try to put a

564
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,929
biological sensor into that and it's

565
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:43,230
moving over the surface of your body

566
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:45,750
every time you move 99% of the time you

567
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:47,310
don't want that so that will create

568
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,550
electrical noise if you're trying to

569
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:51,360
measure

570
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:52,530
EMG it will you know if you're trying to

571
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,969
measure basically anything the

572
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,730
conductivity is going to change and the

573
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:59,520
signal is going to be poor so the other

574
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,050
problem is you don't want chunks even a

575
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,360
button is pretty hard to work with

576
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:06,060
that's the first thing that fails on any

577
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,189
clothing I have clothing as we know it

578
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,810
needs to be washed and dried it needs to

579
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,240
be able to crumple up in a ball and get

580
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:14,510
stepped on over and over and over again

581
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,860
and right now we're not anywhere near

582
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:19,620
putting something functional into that

583
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,149
so I kind of I kind of think that should

584
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,639
stay mostly where it is

585
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:25,470
other than stretch sensors and maybe a

586
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,130
temperature sensor something like that

587
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:32,580
above that structural layer is what I

588
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:34,860
have things like backpacks and gear

589
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,840
falling into that category and I think

590
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:39,719
that has a lot more possibility because

591
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,090
things can be larger as technology moves

592
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,790
forward here's this graph that I

593
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:48,270
completely made up but it's based on

594
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:50,370
real data for example the power density

595
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,080
of lithium-ion batteries how that's

596
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,300
increasing but it's also going to

597
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,220
plateau at some point things like

598
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,620
electric motors as well actually those

599
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,570
plateaued a long time ago with the

600
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,820
current systems that we have there's

601
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,649
only so much scaling that can happen you

602
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,720
can definitely shrink down integrated

603
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:09,510
circuits and things like that and also

604
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,309
the connectivity the cables and things

605
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:13,800
like that can shrink a little bit but

606
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:15,840
but things get pretty limited especially

607
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,820
in the context of clothing where again

608
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,439
you need massive temperature ranges you

609
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,790
need short bend radius if you're going

610
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,950
to crumple everything up in a ball and

611
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:26,070
throw it in the dryer and soak it in

612
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:29,490
chemicals so it's really really a hard

613
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:31,050
environment to work with so this might

614
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:34,080
be a little hyperbolic toward the top of

615
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:37,080
the curve just to dramatize it a bit but

616
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,389
basically with the surface wearable the

617
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,129
structural things that makes it really

618
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:43,410
easy to carry around just about

619
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,720
everything and so that goes up really

620
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:48,059
quickly as soon as anything gets less

621
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,880
than a couple of pounds you can carry it

622
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:52,950
around for an implant or something like

623
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,840
that it's got to be very tiny you can't

624
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,130
really have something gigantic unless

625
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,080
you're going to replace an organ or

626
00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:01,380
something like that the textile

627
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:04,169
integrated stuff well there is a sweet

628
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,730
spot where it is functional more than a

629
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:07,770
few other things but it's pretty brief

630
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:10,530
just because these more farther

631
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:12,840
technologies are accelerating so rapidly

632
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:15,960
we're actually you know I put genetic

633
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,030
edit up there somewhere in 2030 but I

634
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,970
think that's wrong I've already heard of

635
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:22,678
people doing this in China right now so

636
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:26,490
that I may be under estimating how

637
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:29,190
quickly that moves forward so here is

638
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:33,120
the overall picture that I'm trying to

639
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:34,640
illustrate here we put things into these

640
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,270
categories and we can

641
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,550
kind of separate into tears the

642
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,770
functionality for each application and

643
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:44,960
that way depending on what you're trying

644
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:48,379
to do you can come up with a solution

645
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,900
for your product or what you want to

646
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,610
create as opposed to trying to jam

647
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,200
everything into one layer where you're

648
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:59,860
going to have many more technical

649
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:03,680
problems so this is at layer 0 we've got

650
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:05,419
some advantages there for medical

651
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,890
applications obviously and those are

652
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,050
already in use we've had artificial

653
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:12,050
hearts and pacemakers and things like

654
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:19,240
that but obviously very invasive and

655
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:21,340
kind of a big risk I think I skipped oh

656
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,860
yeah ok

657
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:26,750
patches these I don't have an image for

658
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:29,240
this because all the images in my

659
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,650
presentation are my own but if you look

660
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,830
at the University of Illinois they've

661
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:37,130
got some really great RFID coils for

662
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:40,310
power and basically standard medical

663
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:42,170
bandage type materials to hold circuitry

664
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:45,050
on the skin and that will last about a

665
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:46,880
week so the same type of patch is used

666
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:49,700
to deliver medication can be used to

667
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,830
hold electronics and those can last for

668
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,230
quite a long time and then be recharged

669
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:56,689
wirelessly right now there is a company

670
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:58,640
that has NBA players going out the whole

671
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:00,980
team with accelerometers and everything

672
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,840
on the back just a patch and they can

673
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,880
wear it the whole game live update

674
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:09,320
everything coming to a laptop works

675
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:13,040
great this is a quick illustration

676
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:16,340
showing an example of a electromagnetic

677
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,480
field sensor that I just concept I

678
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,490
designed earlier in the year to be

679
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,020
integrated onto the leg the idea being

680
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:24,680
you can sense a gradient and that will

681
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:26,629
turn that into vibration so if 1/2 it

682
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,090
has a stronger sense of the field at the

683
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:31,010
bottom you can you can sense that and

684
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:34,970
also this has a light sensor because

685
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:36,980
it's exposed layer 2 in the textiles I

686
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,930
really think it's mostly stretching

687
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,000
stretch sensors that are going to be

688
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,440
useful here there's not a whole lot else

689
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,450
you can do with it because if you put a

690
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,920
battery in it you can't wash it nobody

691
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,170
wants to charge anything nobody wants to

692
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:51,190
take in their

693
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:53,830
clothing apart everytime they wash it so

694
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:55,600
the gear that I think we're gonna move

695
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,669
away from the wrists and do things that

696
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,169
are a little more integrated huge

697
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:01,420
advantage I see here is for power

698
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:03,670
because that's one thing we can't shrink

699
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,770
down any smaller than it is I would like

700
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:07,990
to see powder power like a lectin

701
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:10,660
battery all integrated into one spot on

702
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:12,370
the body and other applications that

703
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,530
definitely have to be in that category

704
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:16,419
or remote sensing so if you're gonna

705
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:18,490
look at light this is just a rough

706
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:20,380
sketch done earlier in the air for an

707
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:22,150
electromagnetic sensor they're gonna be

708
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,550
looking at light or something like that

709
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:30,580
you have to be exposed you can't put a

710
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:33,879
textile layer over that obviously so in

711
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:35,520
the future I would expect that yes

712
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,900
technology is going to get smaller

713
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,120
batteries will get smaller computation

714
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,100
will increase for the size that we have

715
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:45,129
but there is still always going to be

716
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:47,320
this spectrum of functionality related

717
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:49,180
to the scale of the components and

718
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,950
that's going to shift but things like

719
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,500
for example if you need a respirator or

720
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:55,330
an oxygen tank that might move off of a

721
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,920
cart and onto your body but it's not

722
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:58,810
going to be implanted into your body I

723
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,570
think we can rule that out for a lot of

724
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:05,639
technologies for barring some type of

725
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:08,520
revolution in the laws of physics so

726
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:11,200
just a couple of concepts to wrap up

727
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:14,050
this is an illustration showing a

728
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,140
backpack power source two different

729
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:19,930
layers one is a static layer and one is

730
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:22,000
a structural layer no dynamic layer on

731
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:24,670
this a leotard type of a thing I would

732
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,980
consider a static layer like yoga pants

733
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:30,550
can still have structure or stretch

734
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:34,240
sensor in it but the top layer would

735
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:35,919
hold things like wiring cooling air and

736
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,570
liquids can flow through a structural

737
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,980
layer and eventually when we have

738
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,889
multi-material 3d printing

739
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:44,020
we'll be able to print functional

740
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:45,670
machines essentially all at once with

741
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:48,840
all that functionality just built into

742
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:51,570
it and that because it's outside any

743
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:54,370
clothing layer doesn't need to be washed

744
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:57,010
as frequently think of it like leather a

745
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:58,959
leather jacket yes you might take it to

746
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,250
a cleaners a couple of times but you

747
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,640
really don't throw it in a washing

748
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,830
machine

749
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,240
every day you just don't have to because

750
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:07,840
you're replacing the layers underneath

751
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,020
it another even more out there concept

752
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,090
this one has electromagnets that help it

753
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,559
float above the body so she's wearing a

754
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:17,199
structural layer but it never actually

755
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:21,660
touches anywhere so it's a bit out there

756
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:24,340
but it kind of gets the point across so

757
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:26,410
in the future what I expect to see is

758
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,120
people recognizing that we shouldn't put

759
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:30,160
everything into one layer and we can

760
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:32,379
easily separate these things out so

761
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,150
there's patches with the NFC coils they

762
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,340
only need a very very tiny battery

763
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:37,929
because let's say you have a backpack or

764
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,760
something that charges it you only need

765
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:41,890
to put that on for a few minutes a day

766
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,690
and all of your patches are charged up

767
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:45,070
again you don't you can shower with

768
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,929
those you don't have to take them off at

769
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:49,120
night they might last a couple of weeks

770
00:29:46,929 --> 00:29:53,620
and then you just throw them in a

771
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,360
recycling bin and that's it so that is

772
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,639
where I see wearable technology going

773
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,340
and again that that external layer can

774
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:03,340
also ensure can also charge implanted

775
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:05,709
devices so that eliminates the power

776
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,659
need for that as well and of course they

777
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:09,220
carry the data just a quick example I

778
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,160
want to mention of that I did a

779
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:14,860
consulting project for a woman who was

780
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,500
developing an undergarment for women's

781
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:20,260
health issues that had some sensors in

782
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,480
it that obviously had to record intimate

783
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,580
data and she had consulted with many

784
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,130
wearable technology people who all told

785
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,020
her to make a garment that has wires

786
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:31,570
woven into it or something like that

787
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:34,110
huge huge project what started as a

788
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:35,950
device became a whole line of

789
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:38,709
undergarments at all different sizes

790
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:40,690
using a technology that didn't exist yet

791
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:43,540
my recommendation was to simply use a

792
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:46,150
surface patch with an NFC coil and a

793
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:48,399
belt that has another NFC coil to send

794
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:50,950
power and data to a disposable patch

795
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:54,160
that's on the skin very simple solution

796
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:58,570
and it works for 99% of the biological

797
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:01,860
measurement cases and that's it if

798
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,860
anyone has any questions

799
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:12,908
we've got time for one question I'll

800
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:16,279
catch over here this is addressed to the

801
00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:18,860
dynamic layer have you talked to Corning

802
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:22,850
or any of the large manufacturers about

803
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:25,969
the parameters of the sort of wire that

804
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:27,889
they can produce I haven't talked to

805
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,539
Corning but I've talked to a lot of

806
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:31,070
people actually I do know someone who

807
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:33,020
did a I know if you'd call it an

808
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:36,230
internship or a fellowship at the

809
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:40,010
Corning for integrating fiber optics but

810
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:45,260
nothing about wires most suggested them

811
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:46,850
is that in terms of non-standard work

812
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,640
they're doing a tremendous amount of

813
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:51,469
research there is really good work being

814
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,330
done for wearable interfaces so for

815
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:56,059
example you can get a button capacitive

816
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:58,279
touch button and stretch sensors but

817
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:59,840
that's pretty much where it ends because

818
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:02,059
if you want to measure electrical

819
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,039
information like the open BCI headset

820
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:05,629
does you need very good contact with the

821
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:07,309
skin and you need to know where that

822
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:09,169
measurement is taken if you're measuring

823
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:11,840
a muscle and you move one inch that way

824
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:14,120
it's a completely different signal these

825
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,129
other so you're gonna be doing demos

826
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,840
across the hall here shortly after with

827
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:19,279
some of the stuff right yeah you can

828
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,189
talk to me a little bit later about that

829
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:24,260
I've got I want to I'm gonna dive in

830
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,909
about wearable electronics back there

831
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:28,520
I've got more specific stuff that's

832
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:35,570
outside the scope of the talk okay cool

833
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:40,279
um thank you thank you well so today I

834
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:43,549
will be talking about makeup you think

835
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:47,720
about the evolution of makeup it

836
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:52,220
actually didn't change very much I have

837
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:57,010
a realistic my mom has a realistic my

838
00:32:52,220 --> 00:33:00,950
grandma has realistic we use makeup to

839
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:04,820
highlight some part of our body or hide

840
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:08,000
some part of our body so during my

841
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:11,149
research this is part of my PhD project

842
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,179
and I was thinking about how we could

843
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:17,479
have how we can be close to the body how

844
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:20,540
could we using our two meter square

845
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:25,190
for skiing but with technology in an

846
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:27,700
aesthetic way so my proposal is called

847
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:30,830
beauty technology it's a way to use

848
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:33,260
electronics and cosmetics in a way that

849
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:35,600
we could apply that directly to your

850
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:38,870
skin and with that we could control

851
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,360
different devices and I will be showing

852
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:47,030
you some projects that we have been

853
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:52,399
working around this so the first project

854
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:55,399
will show you is about here here is an

855
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:59,090
interesting tool that we usually use

856
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:02,419
mainly girls we torture work here when

857
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:04,428
we are very nervous when we are thinking

858
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:08,050
very much about something or evening

859
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:10,550
it's kind of like a flirty device so

860
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:15,050
what if we could use these unconscious

861
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:18,970
behaviors but consciously for activating

862
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:21,950
devices so what I did was I was using

863
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:25,009
hair extensions and with a chemical

864
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:28,189
process I metallized them and attached

865
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:31,280
to a circuit the hot glue to it in that

866
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:34,909
way I could use this hair extension as a

867
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:38,649
touch device like your phone and you

868
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:41,419
could interact with other other objects

869
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:44,868
so these are hair extensions and each

870
00:34:41,418 --> 00:34:49,658
coach could be identified and it will be

871
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:58,780
funded to a on a smart phone and we call

872
00:34:49,659 --> 00:35:01,970
send a message with your phone you also

873
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:04,850
if you think a little more like inspire

874
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:07,149
record a conversation where you see your

875
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,150
phone

876
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:22,160
also if you are in a danger situation

877
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:24,470
you don't want to take out your phone

878
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,069
and you can't even touch your hair and

879
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:30,069
say send your localization for example

880
00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:32,329
so it's a way that we use these

881
00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:37,009
unconscious behaviors that we already

882
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:44,150
have but now consciously okay I think

883
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:46,640
they have sound so a part of our body

884
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:50,540
that I was kind of interesting was our

885
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,879
fingernails our fingernails and we could

886
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:56,240
control different things we have these

887
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,690
fine motor that we that in acts as to

888
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,490
reach things but also point things so we

889
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:04,579
have these fine control of our body

890
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:06,169
through our fingernails so I start

891
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:08,569
thinking about like with which other

892
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:12,980
devices we could be adding to our fake

893
00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:14,480
fingernails of course NFC's and Arif IDs

894
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:16,040
is one of the things that we could be

895
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,369
doing I have been doing also with

896
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:21,619
magnets and creating even nail polish

897
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:25,099
that could be conductive so kind of

898
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:28,730
extreme capabilities and this project is

899
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:32,150
called tech nails and we what we do is

900
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,740
like we were using RFID and this

901
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:36,319
terrified is where you need fake

902
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:40,520
fingernail so in this way for example

903
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:43,190
here this is kind of a piano in there as

904
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,500
I don't need to touch the device each of

905
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:49,790
my fingernails could be a different

906
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:53,150
musical note and then I was interesting

907
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:56,869
about this idea of no touching devices

908
00:36:53,150 --> 00:37:02,140
for interaction and and that's something

909
00:36:56,869 --> 00:37:05,240
that NFC sonography this gives to us so

910
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:07,700
this device in some way is kind of in

911
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,220
the air I could put other materials

912
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:13,250
around it so what about water

913
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:15,919
what if I could put them around is like

914
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:18,109
an aquarium and make each of fingernails

915
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,900
kind of like a DJ controller into the

916
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:24,000
water so when the DJ put her finger nose

917
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:29,000
into the water you could enact the

918
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
prynt sound or different music tracks

919
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:35,140
[Music]

920
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,690
[Applause]

921
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,690
[Music]

922
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,920
[Music]

923
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:01,440
because I have like idea of taking out

924
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:04,640
the DJ from behind the console and

925
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,830
putting them in like in these different

926
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,200
interface that is water and with also

927
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:15,120
lighting and like this magic that water

928
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:18,859
and interaction could give to you so

929
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:23,810
after that project I also was very

930
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:26,900
fascinated about our facial muscles and

931
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:31,710
how we could also interact through them

932
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:34,290
so this project we call it Kinney fee

933
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:37,320
that means movement in Greg and we were

934
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:41,520
thinking about how we could make our

935
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:45,060
skin to be an interface and our faith

936
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:47,880
has around like 45 muscles that they

937
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:50,670
move in jump with other ones but also

938
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,970
independently so we select some of them

939
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:56,460
we select like when you raise your

940
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:59,669
eyebrow when your smile when you wink

941
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:03,210
when you close your lips and with these

942
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:06,840
facial mask movements we could even

943
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:09,780
interact with other devices and so this

944
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:14,070
video that I will show you now we were

945
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:15,780
trying to think about that way of making

946
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:18,390
our face and these each of these

947
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:21,240
movements a different life pattern that

948
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:23,900
could be activated like in a in art

949
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,899
project

950
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:41,309
[Music]

951
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:20,169
so this project was first exhibited in

952
00:40:18,279 --> 00:40:23,859
our select Ronnie canvassing Barbican

953
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:26,229
hablando in different places but the

954
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:32,469
motivation of it comes from something

955
00:40:26,229 --> 00:40:33,629
else we start after after one of my

956
00:40:32,469 --> 00:40:38,819
projects

957
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:41,859
sangwon came to me and say you know

958
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:45,038
there are very simple things for you

959
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:49,450
guys like to run all the TV or changing

960
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:53,079
the channels for me it takes so much

961
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:56,379
time to wait for someone to help me and

962
00:40:53,079 --> 00:41:00,700
he was Philippe he was twice world

963
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:02,799
championship in to the zoo in in during

964
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:05,910
a training heat Damascus helps he cannot

965
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:08,769
move so we were creating these

966
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:12,098
interfaces for creating the second

967
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:15,899
scheme that will interact with the TV

968
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:19,119
and changing the channels when he blinks

969
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:21,839
so these are some of the projects we

970
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:25,239
have been creating and one of the

971
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:27,609
motivations I have as a researcher is to

972
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:31,119
share it and I do like in different ways

973
00:41:27,609 --> 00:41:33,009
with papers or Arabic and it helped to

974
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,410
share it so everyone could be having

975
00:41:33,009 --> 00:41:37,960
access to this and could be implemented

976
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:41,000
at your own their own project

977
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:43,610
and it's kind of like interesting for me

978
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,430
that after a while I could see even like

979
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:49,400
stirrups that are create are creating

980
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:51,710
these also project with similar as ideas

981
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,300
that we had at the beginning like for

982
00:41:51,710 --> 00:42:00,470
example paying the metro with your

983
00:41:53,300 --> 00:42:04,820
fingernail so then when after I finished

984
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:07,250
my PhD in Brazil I I went to the Media

985
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,110
Lab and I was started working in this

986
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:12,440
collaborative project with Harvard

987
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:15,770
Medical School and we're talking a lot

988
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:18,770
about the scheme and how we cool see how

989
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:21,200
our skin as as a portal of us of our

990
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:24,350
inner self because our skin it already

991
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,330
communicate if your skin when you are

992
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:28,160
you know embarrass said you get red or

993
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:30,020
when you for example you have some

994
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:34,850
allergy also you could have to go get

995
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:37,790
some information from your skin however

996
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:41,060
there are other information that we can

997
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:43,340
no display if you want to know your

998
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:45,890
cholesterol levels or your glucose

999
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:49,670
levels you go you might do some blood

1000
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:53,480
tests so we were thinking about how we

1001
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:55,880
could read information that it's inside

1002
00:42:53,480 --> 00:43:00,770
of your body that you usually don't have

1003
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:04,040
access to so we create this project that

1004
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:07,340
we call it the dermal abyss and it's a

1005
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:09,860
way that we are using tattoos but the

1006
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:12,920
tools instead of using a traditional ink

1007
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:14,690
we were using biosensors and I have

1008
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,570
sensors that change color depending on

1009
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:20,240
the changes in your bio data so imagine

1010
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:22,370
that you have diabetes and you could

1011
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,750
read your tattoo and you can see the

1012
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:25,880
color of the data viewer that will

1013
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:29,990
changing and you will know when you will

1014
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:32,750
need more insulin so we were working

1015
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:38,060
with different biosensors with sodium

1016
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:40,550
glucose pH in different ways like

1017
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:41,870
chromogenic and also fluorescence so you

1018
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:44,540
could just see that like fluorescent

1019
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:47,450
light but also otherwise that where you

1020
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:51,350
could also be able to change take take a

1021
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:53,330
look to the color how it's changing and

1022
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:57,259
we were making some experiments with

1023
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:59,740
that in pigskin and we were injecting

1024
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:02,870
these biosensors with a tattoo gun and

1025
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:05,419
saying like what how these colors could

1026
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:13,730
be inside of your skin and trying to

1027
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:16,160
make it change so you see for example is

1028
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:22,940
the pH sensor and it's changing from

1029
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:27,170
purple to pink and so and after we were

1030
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:30,020
sharing like these possibility we were a

1031
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:32,210
lot in the media but also a lot of

1032
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:34,790
people approached to us and approached

1033
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:37,790
to ask with different ideas ideas like

1034
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:40,940
mainly people that have diabetes also

1035
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:43,100
other diseases but even like oh we would

1036
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:44,960
like to apply that to animals you know

1037
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:47,750
animals cannot communicate I would like

1038
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,580
to know what there are symptoms or other

1039
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:52,040
people saying like oh we like to apply

1040
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:54,259
that to astronauts you know they are way

1041
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:56,509
too many time in the space how we cool

1042
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,990
like we cannot do blue tights all the

1043
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:59,720
time

1044
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:02,629
so we we came with many many different

1045
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:04,669
ideas and I would like to also to make

1046
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:07,100
clear that this was like this is the

1047
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:10,010
first first stage of this research and

1048
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:12,680
we wanted to show this as a new

1049
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:13,520
possibility as a new possibility to

1050
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,950
using the body

1051
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,530
and to having tattoos that are

1052
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:22,250
interactive and let you read information

1053
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:25,760
from inside of you so we didn't apply

1054
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:28,880
yet - to humans we are still working in

1055
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,620
new possibilities I just joining UC

1056
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,860
Davis is a new faculty so it will be

1057
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:36,589
like working new ways to creating also

1058
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:40,940
different interfaces on the skin or in

1059
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:44,170
the skin and for me it was it was a

1060
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:48,890
great possibility to show these

1061
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:52,040
technology - to show this as a new

1062
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:54,109
possibility for bio technologies that it

1063
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:56,900
could be some you could have also

1064
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:59,720
tattoos like a traditional body

1065
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:02,030
modification practice but actually with

1066
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:04,129
technology that allows you to read

1067
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:05,420
information that it's inside of your

1068
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:08,690
body

1069
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:13,520
so these result for me

1070
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:15,110
is a new possibility for interacting

1071
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,210
with a body interacting with the skin

1072
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:22,160
and making your your body serve faith

1073
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:24,800
through cosmetics or through tattoos and

1074
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:27,279
giving other body modifications but we

1075
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,990
technology that cool-cool allows you to

1076
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,600
crave things in different context

1077
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:33,859
because you could think about

1078
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,549
fingernails in your everyday life for

1079
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:39,680
pay in the metro but a hair extension

1080
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:41,270
touching your hair for sending

1081
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,149
information of your location when you're

1082
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:46,970
in danger like a security system or you

1083
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:48,650
could think about health like in the

1084
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:51,200
case of Philippe that he could turn on

1085
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:53,300
the TV with his blinking and even like

1086
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,370
this also other project of the tools

1087
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,990
that is also related with health so you

1088
00:46:55,370 --> 00:47:02,620
could read information salad everybody

1089
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:07,180
so this is this way that I was mixing

1090
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:10,009
body modification in an interactive and

1091
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:13,460
aesthetic way so you're asking could be

1092
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:15,770
an interactive platform that allows you

1093
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:18,860
also to be what you are

1094
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:22,040
so it kind of invisible devices that

1095
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:25,960
allows you to have interaction so thank

1096
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,960
you very much and I have any questions

1097
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:32,120
so I'm gonna say my bias right from the

1098
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:33,710
beginning totally in favorite totally in

1099
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,839
favor of technological advancement in

1100
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:37,580
body augmentation I think we should all

1101
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,410
have the right to body autonomy and be

1102
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:41,049
able to add technology to our bodies in

1103
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:45,200
ways that work for us individually

1104
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:46,520
personally socially I don't think I can

1105
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,520
argue against that and I'm super excited

1106
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:51,230
by the potential but you still can think

1107
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,120
critically about things that you're

1108
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:55,130
excited about and things that you're in

1109
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:58,220
favor of and I think that's really

1110
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:59,660
valuable for us as I think that we can

1111
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:01,250
all say that AI is gonna be and I'm

1112
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:03,020
talking true AI I'm gonna sometimes

1113
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:06,320
conflate the terms machine learning and

1114
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:08,720
under the term AI okay but for true AI a

1115
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,640
thinking entity it's gonna be the

1116
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,640
greatest creation of our time I don't I

1117
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:16,069
don't think we can argue this Stanford

1118
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:18,200
University has released just as of

1119
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:19,279
November their first ever AI index and

1120
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,868
so they're starting to show some

1121
00:48:19,279 --> 00:48:25,369
data about how things are progressing

1122
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:27,679
and interest in AI is rising probably

1123
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:29,569
the most ever not just from a computer

1124
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:31,749
science perspective but from interest

1125
00:48:29,569 --> 00:48:34,249
from the general public right now and

1126
00:48:31,749 --> 00:48:38,078
data showing all sorts of good things

1127
00:48:34,249 --> 00:48:40,729
about algorithms increasing AI can now

1128
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:43,279
recognize simple human speech patterns

1129
00:48:40,729 --> 00:48:46,098
and identify the voice at the same rate

1130
00:48:43,279 --> 00:48:47,989
that a human subject can where they've

1131
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:49,579
admitted the gap is and I think a lot of

1132
00:48:47,989 --> 00:48:52,939
us are seeing it here this weekend is

1133
00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:55,369
the impact that AI technology is gonna

1134
00:48:52,939 --> 00:48:59,538
have on society and this matters a whole

1135
00:48:55,369 --> 00:49:02,539
lot right now we really only theorized

1136
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:04,579
the impact that AI is gonna have on

1137
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:06,229
society all we can do is basic

1138
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:09,859
conjecture we don't know the path that

1139
00:49:06,229 --> 00:49:10,908
it's gonna take for those of us here in

1140
00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:13,669
the body hacking world

1141
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:15,229
what's implantable AI going to look like

1142
00:49:13,669 --> 00:49:17,058
what is it gonna feel like when it's

1143
00:49:15,229 --> 00:49:18,319
inside of us and some of the people here

1144
00:49:17,059 --> 00:49:20,089
in this room and at the conference this

1145
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:23,989
weekend we're gonna be the early

1146
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:25,880
adopters of all of this and so we assist

1147
00:49:23,989 --> 00:49:28,159
in the direction that AI is going to go

1148
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:29,689
the algorithms being programmed now is

1149
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:32,449
going to be the basis for the

1150
00:49:29,689 --> 00:49:35,058
development of the future so if we're

1151
00:49:32,449 --> 00:49:38,059
gonna be programming this early AI we

1152
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:40,549
need to develop ethical AI but how do

1153
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:43,609
you do that and whose ethics are we

1154
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:47,989
choosing here do we trust corporations

1155
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:50,689
to ethically program AI do we trust

1156
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:53,239
DARPA earlier today do we trust

1157
00:49:50,689 --> 00:49:55,908
ourselves to be the voices for everybody

1158
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:58,369
is my ethics going to be the one you

1159
00:49:55,909 --> 00:50:00,890
want all a I to have you don't know my

1160
00:49:58,369 --> 00:50:04,339
ethics you don't know what I'm willing

1161
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:06,650
to do for things so and we don't even

1162
00:50:04,339 --> 00:50:09,529
know if that's programmable do we want

1163
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:10,969
no ethical AI is that something we

1164
00:50:09,529 --> 00:50:13,099
talked about autonomous cars right now

1165
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:14,209
which you know philosophical question

1166
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:15,829
are they gonna do are they gonna hit the

1167
00:50:14,209 --> 00:50:18,649
school bus full of kids are you gonna

1168
00:50:15,829 --> 00:50:21,229
hit that rock face kill the driver right

1169
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:22,999
we're gonna program that that's what

1170
00:50:21,229 --> 00:50:25,249
going to be an absolute reality so we

1171
00:50:22,999 --> 00:50:26,658
need to think about these things and the

1172
00:50:25,249 --> 00:50:29,359
thing that we don't often think about

1173
00:50:26,659 --> 00:50:31,999
right now is that China is actually the

1174
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,740
world leader in AI development so it's

1175
00:50:31,999 --> 00:50:34,359
not RS

1176
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:35,950
now that we're talking about because we

1177
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:38,369
often think about this from a culture

1178
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:40,839
cultural perspective of North America

1179
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:42,130
Japan last week announced that

1180
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,350
researchers there are going to team up

1181
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:47,440
with researchers from India in order to

1182
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:50,110
compete with the development going on in

1183
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,000
China is it going to be there ethics a

1184
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:53,619
morality that are programmed do they

1185
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,250
even have social scientists working on

1186
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:59,190
their teams we don't know that yet

1187
00:50:56,250 --> 00:51:01,210
so another thing that I want to mention

1188
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:02,410
because again you got to think

1189
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:03,670
critically about these things and I

1190
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:05,950
think a lot of us are thinking about

1191
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:07,450
these things and John he mentioned it

1192
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:09,339
earlier in the in the debate with Tim

1193
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:12,189
and so I'm gonna take a little page from

1194
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:16,619
his book on this is that I worry about

1195
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:19,060
us giving in to AI of giving up our

1196
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:20,500
autonomy and conceding our mind to it

1197
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:22,360
because at first I thought you know what

1198
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:24,130
we're all gonna look really cool when we

1199
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:26,530
have some AI right we're gonna be like

1200
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:28,840
the plugged in cyborg you know we're

1201
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:30,280
gonna have access to ability to to think

1202
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:33,850
in ways that we've never ever thought

1203
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:35,619
about before you know what so now I'm

1204
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:37,330
thinking a little bit differently and

1205
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:39,790
it's not necessarily that we're gonna

1206
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:41,830
use AI that we're just gonna totally

1207
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:43,690
give into it and so we won't be the

1208
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:47,920
plugged in cyborg but we're gonna be the

1209
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:50,080
isolated addict how many of you guys

1210
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,060
Google the answer to a question if

1211
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:53,109
you're doing pub trivia or somebody asks

1212
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:56,049
you know when you're with your friends

1213
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:57,430
who was that actor in that movie well I

1214
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:59,440
don't know I'm just gonna frickin Google

1215
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:01,899
that right you don't try to remember

1216
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:05,109
anymore and we're giving up that aspect

1217
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:08,230
of ourselves I think we can all agree

1218
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:11,590
that our reliance on technology is

1219
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:13,630
rising social isolation is becoming a

1220
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:15,369
bigger issue and our ability to operate

1221
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:18,609
in the social sphere is really

1222
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:20,230
decreasing or maybe I'm just on reddit

1223
00:52:18,609 --> 00:52:25,359
too much and I hear a lot about nice

1224
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:27,490
guys I don't know but it really seems to

1225
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:30,100
feel like there's this fear in society

1226
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:32,169
that we're not we're not communicating

1227
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:36,009
the way that we could be I think we

1228
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:38,350
could do it a lot better I also worry

1229
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:39,640
about you know the black mirror idea of

1230
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:42,730
it what happens with false memories

1231
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:44,830
being implanted how are we going to know

1232
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:45,970
what is reality and what is not I mean

1233
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:47,650
even today

1234
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:50,049
can we be sure that we're in bass

1235
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:52,000
reality we don't know this could

1236
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:54,460
actually be the matrix we could be part

1237
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,800
of an alien video game so what happens

1238
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:59,290
if now you've implanted AI into your

1239
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,940
body and you don't know if you actually

1240
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:02,740
ever did go to the Grand Canyon on that

1241
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:05,680
summer trip with your grandparents and

1242
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:07,930
are you just your memories

1243
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:10,359
does it matter does it matter where this

1244
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:11,828
information comes from so we have to

1245
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:14,828
think about these things and I think

1246
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:17,339
that anybody that's working on AI needs

1247
00:53:14,829 --> 00:53:19,839
to be thinking about it as a team of

1248
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:22,150
scientists computer scientists health

1249
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:24,880
professionals social scientists and

1250
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:26,890
ethic boards and then you guys you guys

1251
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,359
need to have input as well because you

1252
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:30,848
are the ones putting this tech into your

1253
00:53:28,359 --> 00:53:32,500
bodies because like it or not people in

1254
00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:34,150
this room are the ambassadors for this

1255
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,980
movement and you're gonna be the voices

1256
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:38,319
and the representatives for the people

1257
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,030
that will follow so lets them be some

1258
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:54,819
good ones

1259
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:56,109
thanks everyone I am Ryan O'Shea and

1260
00:53:54,819 --> 00:53:57,310
some of you may know me as the

1261
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:59,890
spokesperson for the biotechnology

1262
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:01,720
startup company grindhouse wetware or as

1263
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:03,549
the host of the future grind podcast

1264
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,009
which focuses on the ethics and

1265
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:08,260
implications of emerging technology in

1266
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:09,839
science and also has the goal of

1267
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:13,180
democratizing access to this information

1268
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:15,460
because unfortunately too many cultures

1269
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:17,169
and societies in populations of people

1270
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:19,180
are left out of conversations about the

1271
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:20,619
future we want to increase literacy on

1272
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:22,690
this subject and increase that so that's

1273
00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:24,010
one of the subjects of the podcast but

1274
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:27,670
right now today I'm talking about

1275
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:30,430
hacking humanity with AI and two years

1276
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:33,670
ago I gave a talk at this inaugural year

1277
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:36,040
of body hacks about this topic making

1278
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:37,839
the most of our data the human body in

1279
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,849
the in read of things and I'm gonna look

1280
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:41,828
at this talk today as a bit of an update

1281
00:54:39,849 --> 00:54:44,890
about what's happened the last two years

1282
00:54:41,829 --> 00:54:47,740
from this talk to where we are today so

1283
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:50,140
in this talk I introduce people to the

1284
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:52,500
concept of the circadian voice which was

1285
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:55,960
grindhouse wet wears implant that was in

1286
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:58,750
2013 we implanted this device here in

1287
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,800
the forearm of Tim cannon who was on the

1288
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:02,200
stage earlier

1289
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:04,990
debating John Susanne so what this

1290
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:07,359
device did was a test implant that took

1291
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:09,279
his physiological information in this

1292
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,350
case his temperature and kicked it out

1293
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,180
wirelessly over bluetooth to his Android

1294
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:15,310
device and you may have seen the Vice

1295
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:15,819
motherboard video documentary about this

1296
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:18,490
process

1297
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:21,160
there's the device inside his skin and

1298
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:22,750
you can see it there as well and there's

1299
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,790
not a whole lot of good scale for size

1300
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:26,740
here but it's about the size of perhaps

1301
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:29,380
a decks up a deck of cards so it's a

1302
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:32,740
very large implant right here in his

1303
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:35,530
forearm and what this did is that

1304
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:38,229
essentially made his body a part of the

1305
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:40,150
Internet of Things it was constantly

1306
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:41,710
communicating with his devices his

1307
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:44,230
devices could communicate back and

1308
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:45,400
interact with it so this is a big step

1309
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:46,570
of where we're going in the future you

1310
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,090
know we think of the Internet of Things

1311
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:51,760
we think of our devices communicating

1312
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:54,040
whether it's our refrigerator or cars or

1313
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,290
phone or wearables but this is now the

1314
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:58,930
Internet of people and I think this is a

1315
00:55:56,290 --> 00:56:02,110
big step we're taking forward here so

1316
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:04,120
from this we lead to are all of our

1317
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:06,340
wearables and our repeat we're becoming

1318
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,930
connected to the Internet of Things this

1319
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:10,150
is a little example of that we have our

1320
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:11,740
phones we have music we have heart rate

1321
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:13,660
monitors and other things that are now

1322
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:15,069
getting under the skin and we think the

1323
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:16,839
value of putting it under the skin is

1324
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:19,060
the fact that the resolution could

1325
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:21,100
actually be better you can get more

1326
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:23,529
metrics than you can from outside the

1327
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:25,089
skin and if you compare your Fitbit

1328
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:26,950
steps to the steps that you might get

1329
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:29,380
from your phone a lot of times that

1330
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:30,910
information is completely wildly varying

1331
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,630
and what is the correct answer and it's

1332
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,160
hard to tell

1333
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:34,780
whereas if you're actually in the body

1334
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:37,240
you can get better resolution and better

1335
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:39,700
understand exactly what's happening so

1336
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:42,399
in the Internet of Things I'd say we're

1337
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:44,080
at about step three here you know we

1338
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,970
have the device communication we have

1339
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:48,880
the data sensing and we can send that to

1340
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:50,589
other things and analyze that data and

1341
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,290
make sense of it but that's really all

1342
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:54,970
we're doing at this point we can see if

1343
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:56,560
we've met our steps for the day we can

1344
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:58,689
see what our heart rate is and if that's

1345
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:01,029
what we want our heart rate to be but

1346
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:02,410
the hard date data analytics they're the

1347
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:04,600
machine learning and the artificial

1348
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:07,149
intelligence is needed to make sense of

1349
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:09,190
all of that data of the data from our

1350
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:11,290
pedometers from our other wearable

1351
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:13,270
devices from our smart phones and from

1352
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:13,450
our thermostats so we can link all of

1353
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:15,730
this

1354
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:17,589
data together find patterns in the noise

1355
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:18,880
so we can better understand how to

1356
00:57:17,589 --> 00:57:21,130
interact with our technology and

1357
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,560
interact with each other that's one of

1358
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:26,109
the main focuses of what we want to be

1359
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:29,020
doing so right now

1360
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:31,210
medicine is largely reactive you might

1361
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:33,009
have in this case a heart attack which

1362
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:36,010
really could happen to any of us at any

1363
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:37,930
moment and we don't know and one of the

1364
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:40,240
ideas with Fitness monitors and

1365
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:42,040
wearables is perhaps we could predict

1366
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:45,160
based on subtle changes in your

1367
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:47,230
physiology beforehand what is actually

1368
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,940
causing this to happen and take actions

1369
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:51,130
to perhaps save your life if this is

1370
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:52,960
going to happen to you so right now the

1371
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:54,579
situation is you face a medical

1372
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,109
emergency you end up calling an

1373
00:57:54,579 --> 00:57:58,300
ambulance and you hope you're made you

1374
00:57:56,109 --> 00:58:00,578
make it time is of the essence here and

1375
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:02,550
that's not a good system now with these

1376
00:58:00,579 --> 00:58:05,410
wearable devices we could get into

1377
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:07,630
predicting that this is a piece from

1378
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:09,069
Cisco that I was interviewed in a couple

1379
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:12,010
of years ago where we talked about

1380
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:14,020
moving the body from reacting to

1381
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:15,849
predicting says the state-of-the-art and

1382
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:18,220
wearable technology isn't worn on the

1383
00:58:15,849 --> 00:58:20,050
wrist it's attached to the skin or

1384
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:21,970
perhaps even embedded inside the body

1385
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:23,800
while delivering data rating from the

1386
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:26,520
wearer's heart rate to the frequency of

1387
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:29,020
tremors so this could be used to treat a

1388
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:31,450
medical condition and log that many

1389
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:33,310
people who have diabetes use similar

1390
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:34,750
monitors to monitor their glucose or

1391
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:36,339
insulin levels and to keep track of

1392
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:38,770
their metrics in that way but it could

1393
00:58:36,339 --> 00:58:40,240
also be used for people who don't aren't

1394
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:42,190
currently suffering from any conditions

1395
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,250
to make sure that that doesn't happen to

1396
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:47,319
them and they know what is happening but

1397
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:48,910
predictive is fine you can predict when

1398
00:58:47,319 --> 00:58:50,800
something's gonna happen but that's not

1399
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:53,348
where the real power is the real power

1400
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:55,420
is being proactive and that's what we

1401
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:57,760
want to take the step to be doing so

1402
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:59,859
that's why in January of 2017

1403
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,750
I could I co-founded the artificial

1404
00:58:59,859 --> 00:59:03,970
intelligence startup behavior you can

1405
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,869
see the AI and their behavior spelled

1406
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:06,578
wrong because it's artificial

1407
00:59:04,869 --> 00:59:08,650
intelligence but that's where we going

1408
00:59:06,579 --> 00:59:10,960
with that and this is a Carnegie Mellon

1409
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:12,670
University based startup in Pittsburgh

1410
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,460
Pennsylvania where grindhouse is located

1411
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:18,849
and the goal of behavior is very

1412
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:20,740
specific they want to use machine

1413
00:59:18,849 --> 00:59:22,450
learning and artificial intelligence to

1414
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:24,970
take physiological metrics from wearable

1415
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:26,118
devices of people who are in recovery

1416
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:28,720
from substance use

1417
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:31,430
sorter particularly opioid addiction and

1418
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,999
predict and prevent a relapse before it

1419
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:34,640
occurs

1420
00:59:31,999 --> 00:59:36,769
so by using things like your heart rate

1421
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:39,170
your mute movement your quality and

1422
00:59:36,769 --> 00:59:40,939
quantity of sleep and even information

1423
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:42,920
from your cell phone such as your GPS

1424
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:45,740
location if you're communicating with

1425
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:47,450
anyone and even your typing speed it's

1426
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:49,490
possible to predict when someone may be

1427
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:51,410
at risk of a relapse and launch a

1428
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:53,689
real-time intervention that intervention

1429
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:55,430
could consist of contacting their

1430
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:57,319
12-step sponsor to have someone reach

1431
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:59,149
out in person or perhaps even a

1432
00:59:57,319 --> 01:00:01,880
pre-recorded message that could be on

1433
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:04,309
their phone let them know that they want

1434
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:06,859
themselves to say sober and this has

1435
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:10,099
huge cost not only could a drug relapse

1436
01:00:06,859 --> 01:00:12,170
and your life with an overdose but many

1437
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:14,150
people spend all of their money to go

1438
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:15,680
through rehab if they get back on the

1439
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:17,059
streets and relapse right away they're

1440
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,799
back at square one but this time without

1441
01:00:17,059 --> 01:00:22,279
the resources that they previously had

1442
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:24,200
so this is a big tool of using machine

1443
01:00:22,279 --> 01:00:27,200
learning and artificial intelligence to

1444
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:28,279
help underserved populations regain

1445
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,348
their lives and I think that's exactly

1446
01:00:28,279 --> 01:00:32,089
how we should be using this technology

1447
01:00:30,349 --> 01:00:33,499
and this is some of the media coverage

1448
01:00:32,089 --> 01:00:36,619
we got from this as I said we're based

1449
01:00:33,499 --> 01:00:38,720
in Pittsburgh and there's another one

1450
01:00:36,619 --> 01:00:41,059
there this is from wearable which is a

1451
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,890
industry publication focused on wearable

1452
01:00:41,059 --> 01:00:44,900
devices and now more increasingly

1453
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:46,129
implanted devices talking about how

1454
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:47,930
we're using this to help people with

1455
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:50,720
drug addiction and that's really the

1456
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:53,538
first step and we recently joined the

1457
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:55,879
IBM Watson AI XPrize competition which

1458
01:00:53,539 --> 01:00:58,670
is a three year five million dollar

1459
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:01,130
competition focused on using exponential

1460
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:03,259
technologies particularly AI for the

1461
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:05,539
betterment of humanity to overcome

1462
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:07,400
humanity's Grand Challenges we want to

1463
01:01:05,539 --> 01:01:09,170
impact over a billion people over the

1464
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,960
coming decade and that's the goal of the

1465
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:14,269
IBM Watson AI XPrize if you don't know

1466
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,609
about XPrize it was founded by Peter

1467
01:01:14,269 --> 01:01:17,269
Diamandis who also does Planetary

1468
01:01:16,609 --> 01:01:19,160
Resources

1469
01:01:17,269 --> 01:01:21,229
works with singularity University and a

1470
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,970
couple of other groups many people are

1471
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:25,460
on the board James Cameron Arianna

1472
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:27,348
Huffington are some of the few and you

1473
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:28,730
may be worth the Google Lunar XPrize or

1474
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:31,249
some of the other prizes they have going

1475
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:33,140
on as well but in the IBM Watson AI

1476
01:01:31,249 --> 01:01:34,788
XPrize there's not a specific goal

1477
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:36,859
unlike the others you're not trying to

1478
01:01:34,789 --> 01:01:38,839
meet a set criteria you're just trying

1479
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:39,558
to help humans interact with AI better

1480
01:01:38,839 --> 01:01:41,029
just

1481
01:01:39,559 --> 01:01:42,499
of humanity's Grand Challenges and that

1482
01:01:41,029 --> 01:01:44,689
really spoke to me about that so I've

1483
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:47,390
been really involved with the IBM Watson

1484
01:01:44,689 --> 01:01:48,949
AI XPrize Here I am at their table at

1485
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:51,199
the thrival innovation and music

1486
01:01:48,949 --> 01:01:52,849
festival in Pittsburgh along some robots

1487
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:55,189
they're spreading the word about how we

1488
01:01:52,849 --> 01:01:56,599
can use AI for good and I think

1489
01:01:55,189 --> 01:01:59,209
artificial intelligence is really the

1490
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:02,449
next step in the grinding movement right

1491
01:01:59,209 --> 01:02:04,640
we have hardware in software inside the

1492
01:02:02,449 --> 01:02:06,349
body collecting this data in augmenting

1493
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:08,180
our our abilities whether it's for

1494
01:02:06,349 --> 01:02:10,699
aesthetic purposes or functional

1495
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:13,129
purposes and I think that's great what

1496
01:02:10,699 --> 01:02:14,869
we really need to do is make sense of

1497
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:17,599
that data once it's outside the body and

1498
01:02:14,869 --> 01:02:19,609
AI is the best way that I see to do that

1499
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,109
and like the previous speakers were

1500
01:02:19,609 --> 01:02:23,390
mentioning throughout the day and even

1501
01:02:21,109 --> 01:02:24,769
yesterday during sex sex ride a we don't

1502
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:27,288
want to you know give ourselves over to

1503
01:02:24,769 --> 01:02:29,149
this technology this is to augment human

1504
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:30,859
abilities rather than to replace them

1505
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:34,099
and I think that's important to mention

1506
01:02:30,859 --> 01:02:36,439
and keep in mind and there's so many

1507
01:02:34,099 --> 01:02:38,089
more potentials I actually recently left

1508
01:02:36,439 --> 01:02:40,038
behavior because I thought the focus of

1509
01:02:38,089 --> 01:02:42,019
that company which I co-founded was even

1510
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:43,519
a bit too niche and specific I

1511
01:02:42,019 --> 01:02:45,319
definitely want to solve the problem of

1512
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:46,819
opioid addiction but there are other

1513
01:02:45,319 --> 01:02:49,339
problems that we can even solve beyond

1514
01:02:46,819 --> 01:02:51,859
that this article talks about stress in

1515
01:02:49,339 --> 01:02:55,009
the link between stress and illness and

1516
01:02:51,859 --> 01:02:57,288
actually stress is linked directly to

1517
01:02:55,009 --> 01:02:59,029
the six major causes of death in the

1518
01:02:57,289 --> 01:03:00,410
United States the morbidity and

1519
01:02:59,029 --> 01:03:02,779
mortality due to stress-related

1520
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:04,819
illnesses is alarming emotional stress

1521
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:06,289
is a major contributing factor to the

1522
01:03:04,819 --> 01:03:08,479
six leading causes of death in the

1523
01:03:06,289 --> 01:03:11,089
United States cancer coronary heart

1524
01:03:08,479 --> 01:03:13,129
disease accidental injuries respiratory

1525
01:03:11,089 --> 01:03:16,038
disorders cirrhosis of the liver and

1526
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:17,390
suicide and if you're pre constantly

1527
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:20,299
predicting things about the human body

1528
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:22,160
you're able to see stress before it

1529
01:03:20,299 --> 01:03:24,109
becomes an issue you're able to predict

1530
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,788
it and intervene in real time and you

1531
01:03:24,109 --> 01:03:27,199
don't even need to you don't even need

1532
01:03:25,789 --> 01:03:29,089
to be aware that the intervention is

1533
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:30,709
happening right let's say your wearable

1534
01:03:29,089 --> 01:03:33,199
devices your implants in your phone

1535
01:03:30,709 --> 01:03:35,538
realize that you're becoming stressed

1536
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:38,209
perhaps your GPS automatically routes

1537
01:03:35,539 --> 01:03:40,249
you through a nice park rather than a

1538
01:03:38,209 --> 01:03:42,589
crowded interstate on the way home

1539
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:44,538
perhaps it changes the sense in your

1540
01:03:42,589 --> 01:03:46,578
house way more calming relaxing scent or

1541
01:03:44,539 --> 01:03:48,380
it begins running you a warm bath

1542
01:03:46,579 --> 01:03:50,660
anything that it knows will help

1543
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:53,119
eliminate that stress it can do

1544
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:54,170
automatically without human intervention

1545
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,670
that's some of the things that we're

1546
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:57,559
working towards now and I think that's

1547
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:59,960
really the next step what we need to be

1548
01:03:57,559 --> 01:04:01,970
thinking is what are the applications of

1549
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,529
this technology I know many people in

1550
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:06,019
this audience are early adopters in

1551
01:04:03,529 --> 01:04:07,309
pioneers and that's exactly what we need

1552
01:04:06,019 --> 01:04:09,200
we need the people experimenting with

1553
01:04:07,309 --> 01:04:11,990
this so we know what works and what

1554
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:15,288
doesn't and where we can go from here so

1555
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:18,169
this is what we came from the last two

1556
01:04:15,289 --> 01:04:20,180
years so now I talked about the idea of

1557
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:21,650
using the human body in an Internet of

1558
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:23,210
Things and that we're starting to see

1559
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:25,759
that happening now we're starting to see

1560
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:27,890
AI becoming a big part of our lives in

1561
01:04:25,759 --> 01:04:29,779
the human body is now a part of the

1562
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:32,269
Internet of Things we are all the

1563
01:04:29,779 --> 01:04:33,890
internet of people and I didn't get into

1564
01:04:32,269 --> 01:04:35,569
it and I don't have time to get into it

1565
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:37,549
now because this is the lightning talk

1566
01:04:35,569 --> 01:04:39,829
but the ethical implications of a lot of

1567
01:04:37,549 --> 01:04:41,029
this and the risks of privacy and

1568
01:04:39,829 --> 01:04:43,400
hacking which is definitely a

1569
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:44,990
conversation that we need to have I have

1570
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,029
particularly I'm sure a lot of you

1571
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:48,769
thought of it when I mentioned it using

1572
01:04:47,029 --> 01:04:51,410
these devices on people with opioid use

1573
01:04:48,769 --> 01:04:54,529
disorder this is a population that often

1574
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:56,990
has issues that they might be concerned

1575
01:04:54,529 --> 01:04:58,670
of paranoia or law enforcement knowing

1576
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:00,258
of their whereabouts or there may be

1577
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:02,150
engaging in illicit activities and they

1578
01:05:00,259 --> 01:05:04,069
might not want people to know so how do

1579
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:05,900
we give people the benefits of using

1580
01:05:04,069 --> 01:05:08,029
technology to help them while making

1581
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:10,369
sure that they understand and that we

1582
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:12,440
can confirm that this technology won't

1583
01:05:10,369 --> 01:05:14,749
be used against them because if we start

1584
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,730
having law enforcement subpoena your

1585
01:05:14,749 --> 01:05:18,410
records of finding out what your heart

1586
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:20,539
rate was and were you at risk of using

1587
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:21,950
drugs at a certain time that's not gonna

1588
01:05:20,539 --> 01:05:24,680
help people it might help the law

1589
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:26,359
enforcement bring Kate charges but it's

1590
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:28,249
not gonna help humanity and that's what

1591
01:05:26,359 --> 01:05:30,109
I'm focused on seem to be very careful

1592
01:05:28,249 --> 01:05:31,759
about who has access to your information

1593
01:05:30,109 --> 01:05:32,839
how it's encrypted and how it's

1594
01:05:31,759 --> 01:05:34,279
protected and that's what we need to

1595
01:05:32,839 --> 01:05:38,328
think about going forward so I

1596
01:05:34,279 --> 01:05:39,650
definitely valid cast is future guide

1597
01:05:38,329 --> 01:05:41,180
and if you're interested in this topic

1598
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:42,859
or any of the others that were discussed

1599
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:44,480
here today you can learn a little bit

1600
01:05:42,859 --> 01:05:55,160
more about that and I'm happy to hear

1601
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:58,819
your thoughts and anything else yeah no

1602
01:05:55,160 --> 01:06:01,879
questions oh I can't see anything sorry

1603
01:05:58,819 --> 01:06:04,460
I Ryan you know I'm not quite getting

1604
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:07,010
you know this is not giving over to

1605
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:10,210
technology this man

1606
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:15,080
I mentioned how memory and skills are

1607
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:18,320
eroding and I think we're not in touch

1608
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:20,540
with our bodies anymore and if you if

1609
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:23,560
the whole focus and not just your talk

1610
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:26,570
is about getting data from our bodies

1611
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:28,250
that is it seems to me giving up on

1612
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:30,440
being in touch with our bodies

1613
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:32,390
progressively and that's a very

1614
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:34,580
fundamental alienation I would think a

1615
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:38,620
fundamental estrangement it's going away

1616
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:41,600
from being in touch with our you know

1617
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:43,160
we're talking about yeah I can totally

1618
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,540
see we were coming from and I share some

1619
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,879
of your concerns and I definitely think

1620
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:48,950
that they are justified but to me I

1621
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,690
think this empowers people to better

1622
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:53,899
understand their physiology and biology

1623
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:55,250
you know we are really bags of chemicals

1624
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:57,680
that interact with things in ways that

1625
01:06:55,250 --> 01:07:00,860
we don't understand we are constantly at

1626
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:02,299
the whims of our neuro chemistry on our

1627
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:03,860
hormones and things that are affecting

1628
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:05,780
our bodies in ways that we can't

1629
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:07,760
understand and if we have a stressful

1630
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:09,920
day at work we could come home and be

1631
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,840
angry and short with our spouses or our

1632
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,220
kids or our pets and alienate people in

1633
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:15,290
relationships that we really truly care

1634
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:17,149
about and we don't understand that what

1635
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:18,950
we're actually exhibiting there is a

1636
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:20,660
symptom of this stress that we don't

1637
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:22,759
that we aren't even conscious that we're

1638
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:25,580
experiencing so I think if we're able to

1639
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:27,860
take control of our biology and realize

1640
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:31,430
what is impacting us to act these ways

1641
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:33,500
and that we're not perhaps as free to

1642
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:35,839
choose our reactions in situations as we

1643
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:37,520
sometimes justify ourselves as being or

1644
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:43,250
believe that we are we can make this

1645
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:44,990
better I you talk about being addicted

1646
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:46,850
to substances and how can we help that

1647
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:48,620
but there's addictions more than

1648
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:52,060
substances relation to etiquette two

1649
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:54,980
behaviors smartphones TV series people

1650
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:56,509
could also AI like you know sooner than

1651
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:58,640
later help us just realize this

1652
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:59,720
addiction yeah I think that's one of the

1653
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,609
things we're really working towards and

1654
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:04,939
one of the big questions is there's a

1655
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:07,310
lot of conflicting literature is is the

1656
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:09,830
physiological response of addiction to

1657
01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:12,560
substances whether they're alcohol or

1658
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:15,020
other pharmaceuticals is that the same

1659
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:16,189
type of physiological symptoms that you

1660
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:19,130
would get from an addiction to gambling

1661
01:08:16,189 --> 01:08:20,839
or pornography or anything else and

1662
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:23,239
we're still trying to figure a law

1663
01:08:20,839 --> 01:08:25,519
of that out but regardless I agree that

1664
01:08:23,238 --> 01:08:27,589
this type of information could be used

1665
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,659
to help though any type of addiction and

1666
01:08:27,589 --> 01:08:32,658
how many in right we consider things in

1667
01:08:29,658 --> 01:08:35,479
addiction when they're perhaps bad or

1668
01:08:32,658 --> 01:08:37,729
impact you negatively but if we expanded

1669
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:40,698
that definition to include things that

1670
01:08:37,729 --> 01:08:41,778
you are drawn to do subconsciously that

1671
01:08:40,698 --> 01:08:43,428
you really don't have control over

1672
01:08:41,779 --> 01:08:45,259
whether it is good or bad like many

1673
01:08:43,429 --> 01:08:47,868
people are addicted to fitness and

1674
01:08:45,259 --> 01:08:49,880
running or exercising and that's often

1675
01:08:47,868 --> 01:08:52,130
seen as a good thing in society but is

1676
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:54,319
it really if you can't control your

1677
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:56,089
urges to participate in this activity I

1678
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,380
don't know but finding out if we're

1679
01:08:56,089 --> 01:08:59,149
addicted to those things as well I think

1680
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:00,980
just understanding our body better is

1681
01:08:59,149 --> 01:09:03,769
really don't know about okay last

1682
01:09:00,979 --> 01:09:05,178
question I'm actually gonna hijack this

1683
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:08,960
one but you can only answer one if you

1684
01:09:05,179 --> 01:09:10,310
want to okay so first of all FDA

1685
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,679
regulations I don't know if you're

1686
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:15,949
planning on like facing that I know that

1687
01:09:12,679 --> 01:09:20,179
like diagnosis is hard this is kind of

1688
01:09:15,948 --> 01:09:22,309
borderline and B what about a I am bias

1689
01:09:20,179 --> 01:09:24,949
cuz you can't really go in and like pick

1690
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:26,210
it out and see where things got wrong do

1691
01:09:24,948 --> 01:09:27,948
you have any thoughts about that

1692
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:30,399
Oh address both of them are just the

1693
01:09:27,948 --> 01:09:33,948
first one first because it's much easier

1694
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:37,009
yeah FDA regulation is important there's

1695
01:09:33,948 --> 01:09:38,419
a lot of weather or a type 2 type three

1696
01:09:37,009 --> 01:09:40,488
medical device I don't know what exactly

1697
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:42,670
we would be if we're a wearable that

1698
01:09:40,488 --> 01:09:45,919
goes outside the body and tries to

1699
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:47,750
predict medical conditions but I mean

1700
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,359
you could also market this as not a

1701
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:51,649
medical device it could be a stress

1702
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:53,449
relieving device it could be a

1703
01:09:51,649 --> 01:09:54,739
therapeutic pattern-recognition device

1704
01:09:53,448 --> 01:09:56,750
you know there's ways to market this

1705
01:09:54,739 --> 01:09:59,330
that you're not necessarily making a

1706
01:09:56,750 --> 01:10:01,580
diagnosis or suggestion for a medical

1707
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:03,710
thing like there's meditation apps out

1708
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:05,389
there that might offer similar type uses

1709
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:07,820
or perhaps some of the neuro techs

1710
01:10:05,389 --> 01:10:10,190
people mentioned headbands that you can

1711
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:11,809
wear they can monitor your neural

1712
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:13,759
activity and make things make

1713
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:16,190
predictions about your behavior based on

1714
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:18,409
that but that's not necessarily needs to

1715
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:19,940
be a medical device so it depends you

1716
01:10:18,409 --> 01:10:22,070
know you could go down the road of

1717
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:24,049
actually being a medical device that's

1718
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:25,519
covered by insurance and then you would

1719
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:27,530
want to get people prescribed to use

1720
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,210
these types of devices but that could be

1721
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:30,769
a business model mayhem if you're

1722
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:31,940
talking about it from a financial point

1723
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:33,110
of view and what you want to do as an

1724
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:34,428
entrepreneur so there's lots of

1725
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:34,700
different questions you think about when

1726
01:10:34,429 --> 01:10:36,890
you're

1727
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:38,840
dressing that but really I want this to

1728
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:40,460
be accessible to everyone and there

1729
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:41,930
needs to be some kind of faith the

1730
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:43,640
information that you're getting is

1731
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:46,130
validated by some kind of source so I

1732
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:48,710
think FDA regulation and certification

1733
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:50,840
has value but I don't think it's what I

1734
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:52,490
would want to have to have on it to

1735
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,180
reach the market and begin benefiting

1736
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:55,639
people

1737
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:56,810
the second question about bias is you're

1738
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:59,000
absolutely right

1739
01:10:56,810 --> 01:11:00,710
there are things that could be working

1740
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,850
working their way into artificial

1741
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:03,860
intelligence based on artificial

1742
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:04,430
intelligence looking at human society as

1743
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:06,440
a whole

1744
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:08,390
that we might not want actually being

1745
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:10,280
included in those systems and I don't

1746
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:12,020
have an easy answer for you on that I

1747
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,519
mean there are books and courses and

1748
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:15,020
talks all around the world about how to

1749
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,640
deal with this issue and it is an

1750
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:18,470
important one and it's one but I want to

1751
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,120
take seriously but I think one of the

1752
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:20,900
ways to address that is like I mentioned

1753
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:22,610
one of the goals of the feature on

1754
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:24,379
podcast is to make sure that

1755
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:26,299
underrepresented populations are

1756
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:28,670
included in these conversations that

1757
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:32,090
their voices are heard that more than

1758
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:33,890
one race creed religion gender whatever

1759
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:36,230
is included in the conversations and

1760
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:37,940
sees the code and can access it and put

1761
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:39,669
their feedback and input and this

1762
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:47,360
literacy is very important going forward

1763
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:49,520
thank you thank you all right hello I am

1764
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:52,880
Aaron Trawick I'll shortly be joined by

1765
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:56,210
Machiavelli Davis who works with our

1766
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:58,430
team here in Austin we represent

1767
01:11:56,210 --> 01:12:02,330
assonance biomedical we are essentially

1768
01:11:58,430 --> 01:12:07,340
a startup accelerator for biotechnology

1769
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:10,010
and biomedical gene therapy applications

1770
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:12,290
for chronic infectious disease and

1771
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:16,580
terminal disease as well as human

1772
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:19,400
augmentation the biggest thing I'm going

1773
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:22,550
to kind of keep my words and Mack words

1774
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:26,780
pretty short here today what we would

1775
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:28,610
like to share with you is we have you

1776
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:33,019
know you have likely maybe heard of us

1777
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:36,799
from our work in live testing the first

1778
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:39,530
gene therapy cure for HIV which we live

1779
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:41,930
tested is live stream to about 20,000

1780
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:45,110
people a few months ago and next week on

1781
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:48,679
Saturday we will be live testing phase 2

1782
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:53,030
it's the first gene therapy that we know

1783
01:12:48,679 --> 01:12:57,860
that is confirmed to transect the n6

1784
01:12:53,030 --> 01:13:01,009
antibody that can fight off HIV based on

1785
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:04,699
NIH research into the human cells and

1786
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:07,219
also bind to gp120 which we have

1787
01:13:04,699 --> 01:13:12,138
independently validated through our loud

1788
01:13:07,219 --> 01:13:15,409
Network and here on Sunday tomorrow 3:30

1789
01:13:12,139 --> 01:13:19,579
will be live testing the first gene

1790
01:13:15,409 --> 01:13:23,570
therapy vaccine and cure for herpes so

1791
01:13:19,579 --> 01:13:25,699
please do join us for that but what we

1792
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:29,058
really wanted to share with you today is

1793
01:13:25,699 --> 01:13:31,549
that um these uh these applications that

1794
01:13:29,059 --> 01:13:34,729
we're talking about for HIV for herpes

1795
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:38,170
and for human augmentation are exactly

1796
01:13:34,729 --> 01:13:40,699
that they're applications of open access

1797
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:44,599
platforms that our researchers have

1798
01:13:40,699 --> 01:13:47,900
developed and have created as gifts to

1799
01:13:44,599 --> 01:13:50,059
the bio hacking community to independent

1800
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:53,089
and academic and mainstream researchers

1801
01:13:50,059 --> 01:13:57,409
around the world to help them bring

1802
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:59,809
their work into reality it costs us less

1803
01:13:57,409 --> 01:14:02,869
than a hundred dollars a dose to create

1804
01:13:59,809 --> 01:14:05,719
what is designed to be one-time only

1805
01:14:02,869 --> 01:14:09,409
cures and vaccines one-time only

1806
01:14:05,719 --> 01:14:10,999
injections and so we want to be able to

1807
01:14:09,409 --> 01:14:13,670
share that and work with people who have

1808
01:14:10,999 --> 01:14:16,999
you know greater dreams greater ideas

1809
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:18,800
then we have the time to come up with

1810
01:14:16,999 --> 01:14:20,478
we're a small group of people scattered

1811
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,400
around the world with a lot of talent

1812
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:23,389
and a lot of knowledge and a lot of

1813
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,869
information but we're still a small

1814
01:14:23,389 --> 01:14:29,300
group of people so we have three

1815
01:14:26,869 --> 01:14:32,598
specific platforms one that is designed

1816
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:35,030
to essentially transfer antibody based

1817
01:14:32,599 --> 01:14:38,869
immunities that are experienced by

1818
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:42,768
largely 1% of the population group for

1819
01:14:38,869 --> 01:14:46,098
specific disease to the 99 percent we

1820
01:14:42,769 --> 01:14:48,110
have a human augmentation model a human

1821
01:14:46,099 --> 01:14:52,570
augmentation platform that is designed

1822
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:56,209
to provide peptide and hormone based

1823
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:59,329
augmentation for everything from

1824
01:14:56,209 --> 01:15:02,599
hormonal stability and recovery to

1825
01:14:59,329 --> 01:15:04,849
muscle growth and bone density

1826
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:10,070
reservation and then we have an

1827
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:12,740
additional platform for the which is a

1828
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:15,500
nano robotic genetically programmed

1829
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:19,820
gene therapy delivery system that

1830
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:24,160
provides the means which provides the

1831
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:27,469
means for us to bind immunities to

1832
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:29,720
specific diseases that you don't ever

1833
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:33,280
have antibodies for naturally like

1834
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:35,450
herpes or cancer to the immune system

1835
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:38,509
essentially giving your immune system

1836
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:41,179
the tools it needs to fight off and

1837
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:45,650
prevent entirely diseases it could never

1838
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:48,410
otherwise genetically bite off and so

1839
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:50,379
Mac here handles all of our production

1840
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:52,580
here in Austin we couldn't do anything

1841
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:54,080
that we do without him

1842
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:56,960
he's brilliant so he's gonna talk a

1843
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:59,480
little bit about um his vision as well

1844
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:02,000
for where we'll be next year in terms of

1845
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:05,030
our work and the continual open access

1846
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:09,290
of our technologies and platforms to the

1847
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:15,710
community and to the world and after

1848
01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:18,050
that ask us anything how do you my name

1849
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:20,420
is Machiavelli Davis I'm doing

1850
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:23,570
production for ascendance biomedical

1851
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:26,120
here in Austin North Austin at prophase

1852
01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:28,940
bio Studios Austin's first and only

1853
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:30,650
biohacker space we have some founders

1854
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:33,500
here in the audience always love coming

1855
01:16:30,650 --> 01:16:35,990
to body hacking con we've been working

1856
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:40,550
on the scale up in purification

1857
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:45,139
procedure for five months now and it's

1858
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:47,870
amazing how repetitive and

1859
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:51,110
labor-intensive at times it can be and

1860
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:54,070
so we've nailed down parts of the

1861
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:57,740
process that needs to be automated and

1862
01:16:54,070 --> 01:17:02,179
the process of gene therapy production

1863
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:05,510
purification is a very it's the same

1864
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:07,910
process almost every time because you're

1865
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:12,500
only swapping out the genetic

1866
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:15,989
information and ultimately this is a

1867
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:19,260
process that I've

1868
01:17:15,989 --> 01:17:20,089
is perfectly miniaturized Bowl and it's

1869
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:24,300
perfectly

1870
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:26,730
automatable so what we're looking at

1871
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:31,770
coming out with necks as early as next

1872
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:35,629
year for select beta testing would be a

1873
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:40,080
software and hardware suite that allows

1874
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:42,810
home users or laboratory technicians to

1875
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:46,890
begin to create their own novel gene

1876
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:50,580
therapies at a small scale with a robust

1877
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:53,219
purification procedure of course quality

1878
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:56,850
control metrics using third-party

1879
01:17:53,219 --> 01:18:01,410
laboratories to test your sample still

1880
01:17:56,850 --> 01:18:07,040
needs to be done but it would be amazing

1881
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:10,800
to see the world blossom with more

1882
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:14,370
biotech poets who are writing their own

1883
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:17,760
genetic language in order to improve

1884
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:22,370
their lives when I grew up as a teenager

1885
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:26,100
I very much enjoyed the story as I read

1886
01:18:22,370 --> 01:18:29,840
the autobiographical accounts even of

1887
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:33,060
the first anarchist print makers in

1888
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:38,010
medieval Europe in the 15 and 1600s

1889
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:40,800
these were incredible people that you

1890
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:45,210
know were fighting through darker times

1891
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:48,540
in order to many of them would build

1892
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:51,210
these printmaking machines at home or in

1893
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:54,660
shared creative spaces often times

1894
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:57,600
they'd be in their 20s and this was a

1895
01:18:54,660 --> 01:19:02,030
time before books were common so it was

1896
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:05,850
really socially transformative for these

1897
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:09,900
these printmaking people and this this

1898
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:11,960
printmaking idea to spread and for

1899
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:14,460
people to share information across

1900
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:22,680
distances that otherwise would not be

1901
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:24,719
possible before I got into the the gene

1902
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:27,000
therapy and the biotech business

1903
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:29,760
starting the the space here in Austin I

1904
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:33,570
would build 3d printers

1905
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:37,770
at home and I used to teach classes to

1906
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:41,219
middle school kids on how to 3d print

1907
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:45,210
and things like that so that this is the

1908
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:49,640
this is the path that I see coming and

1909
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:53,210
it's one that we continue from the first

1910
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:57,510
print maker is back in medieval Europe

1911
01:19:53,210 --> 01:20:04,230
so just to be clear I just want to say

1912
01:19:57,510 --> 01:20:08,040
one more time that we're looking at we

1913
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:09,660
have a really cool bioreactor automation

1914
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,280
hardware and software specialists on our

1915
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:13,080
team too

1916
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:19,200
but the process that we have is

1917
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:22,559
basically 98% finished and I'm really

1918
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:25,290
loving the opportunity to offer next

1919
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:29,580
year hopefully a hardware and software

1920
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:37,370
suite that allows home users to design

1921
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:37,370
and manufacture a novel gene therapies

1922
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:50,030
questions thank you

1923
01:20:56,870 --> 01:21:00,870
yes

1924
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:03,509
so with Tristan Roberts who handles

1925
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:06,269
development and our inbound investing

1926
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:08,010
platform which is uh it's available in a

1927
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:10,530
minimalist form on our website now but

1928
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:11,970
in a few minute or of days or less than

1929
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:14,190
a week you'll be able to see the

1930
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:16,290
developmental pipeline for H of our 14

1931
01:21:14,190 --> 01:21:19,139
different gene therapies you'll be able

1932
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:21,390
to see transparent access to information

1933
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:23,400
quality control information along every

1934
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:24,510
step of the pipeline and do inbound

1935
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,519
investing if that's what you're

1936
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:28,890
interested in or just be on a wait list

1937
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:31,320
to be able to access these therapies

1938
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:33,030
legally as soon as they're confirmed

1939
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:35,639
safe and efficacious and back to that

1940
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:38,009
point then when it comes to the HIV

1941
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:40,980
therapy we did an initial safety dose a

1942
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:44,670
very minor the phase 2 testing is about

1943
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:46,379
250 to 500 times more potent but with

1944
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:49,470
the initial safety test the data that we

1945
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:52,770
did see was very promising though viral

1946
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:54,930
loads HIV viral counts did increase we

1947
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:57,840
also saw which is attributable to immune

1948
01:21:54,930 --> 01:22:00,510
response cd4 and cd8 levels which are

1949
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:03,210
indicative of the overall health of the

1950
01:22:00,510 --> 01:22:05,640
HIV patient if they go too low you know

1951
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:07,350
they're in danger of having AIDS his cd4

1952
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:09,330
cd8 levels went higher than he'd ever

1953
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:11,340
seen in his life and they stayed there

1954
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:13,950
for a good month and a half at just a

1955
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:16,950
safety dose so that was very promising

1956
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:19,950
and in our consultations with academic

1957
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:23,490
researchers whom we cannot name but who

1958
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:27,000
would know the hypothesis here is that

1959
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:29,910
with the n6 it will either be able to

1960
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:32,460
outright cure HIV as it did in the

1961
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:36,630
original NIH research 80 to 95 percent

1962
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:39,270
of HIV viral loads were eliminated in

1963
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:42,770
the patient it'll either be able to do

1964
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:45,450
that or it will increase in perpetuity

1965
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:48,150
cd4 cd8 levels to the extent that the

1966
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:50,760
patient's immune system will be at a new

1967
01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:54,030
standard a new status quo and it will

1968
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:55,920
not matter how much viral how much virus

1969
01:22:54,030 --> 01:22:58,139
they have it will not affect or impact

1970
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,810
or change they will have the same level

1971
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:02,970
of human performance and same experience

1972
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:06,300
of life as you or I have without HIV

1973
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:08,770
they'll still be able to transfer it but

1974
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:10,780
they won't be impaired by it

1975
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:14,110
and if that's the case then we will work

1976
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:16,690
with three new antibodies add those in

1977
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:19,599
and create a combinatory era Pete it

1978
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:21,849
will functionally cure HIV

1979
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:25,360
so obviously the curing of any disease

1980
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:27,520
is not a finite game it's an infinite

1981
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:30,299
game as soon as you cure the disease it

1982
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:33,010
will evolve as we evolve fast enough to

1983
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:35,020
kill it all and so you will have to

1984
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:37,300
continue developing stronger and

1985
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:43,630
stronger therapies for what will be

1986
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:45,340
essentially eight a word what's the word

1987
01:23:43,630 --> 01:23:48,580
opposite of growing a decreasing

1988
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:51,610
population decreasing population

1989
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:53,080
actually affected by the disease so you

1990
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:56,130
know what we expect is that you know two

1991
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:58,840
years from now we'll see HIV as

1992
01:23:56,130 --> 01:24:00,790
something that is experienced by just

1993
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:03,010
like you know four or five percent of

1994
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:05,110
the population and then you're having to

1995
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:08,830
develop stronger and stronger therapies

1996
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:11,769
for that population that's super HIV

1997
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:14,050
population but the individuals who

1998
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:17,920
commonly would experience HIV as a mass

1999
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:23,620
disease would be much less you can you

2000
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:30,700
can bring their health forward my

2001
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:34,030
question for Machiavelli you get

2002
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:36,730
involved with things that are less

2003
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:39,250
electronic may be based on bio physics

2004
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:45,419
and physical chemistry as part of the

2005
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:48,820
focus that you're open to in terms of

2006
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:52,120
gene therapy vector production things

2007
01:24:48,820 --> 01:25:01,090
that are not electronic and utilize

2008
01:24:52,120 --> 01:25:02,469
physical chemistry yes I I don't think

2009
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:05,800
any of the methods are particularly

2010
01:25:02,469 --> 01:25:11,500
physical chemistry based that I'm aware

2011
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:13,360
of right now so no and I also can't

2012
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:16,680
think of any if you have an idea please

2013
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:20,370
share it with me that sounds interesting

2014
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:20,370
okay the other question

2015
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:30,660
all right like HIV we think also

2016
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:33,150
something similar to what happened with

2017
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:35,700
flu each year is gonna mooch around HIV

2018
01:25:33,150 --> 01:25:37,500
mutates really fast a couple years ago

2019
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:40,110
some people was able also traveling in

2020
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:43,110
HIV by taking out the Co virus from the

2021
01:25:40,110 --> 01:25:45,480
DNA but the mutation made it actually go

2022
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:47,250
again yeah so how do you look at these

2023
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:49,440
life because you talked about population

2024
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:51,480
from a stand point of view but also this

2025
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:53,759
same patient is gonna have a population

2026
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:57,179
of isodyne located over and over again

2027
01:25:53,760 --> 01:26:00,000
of course so the the solution there is

2028
01:25:57,180 --> 01:26:01,680
to study the presence of the n6 antibody

2029
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,840
in the body and ensure that it is

2030
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:06,030
staying at peak concentrations in

2031
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:07,860
perpetuity the only way to do that is

2032
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:10,139
with blood samples and that will be done

2033
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:11,670
on a weekly ongoing basis for the next

2034
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:14,370
six months with Tristan Roberts

2035
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:15,960
following Phase two and that will give

2036
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:19,019
us all the information that we need to

2037
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:21,330
know to determine exactly how long the

2038
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:24,540
phase to therapy lasts within the body

2039
01:26:21,330 --> 01:26:26,250
how much it needs to be optimized and if

2040
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:28,710
it needs to be combined with other

2041
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:31,320
antibodies and like you know so that's

2042
01:26:28,710 --> 01:26:33,660
it so that's the the answer for that and

2043
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:35,670
that's what we're dedicated to we've

2044
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:39,570
made a personal commitment to Tristan

2045
01:26:35,670 --> 01:26:41,220
Roberts to cure his HIV and that was you

2046
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:43,080
know that goes along with it we knew

2047
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:45,420
that we would probably have to we might

2048
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:47,190
have to develop these other antibodies

2049
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:49,290
and create combined Ettore therapies

2050
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:51,750
because even if we cure Tristan Tristan

2051
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:54,030
is not like every other man or woman on

2052
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:56,010
the face of the earth who has HIV he's

2053
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:57,929
living in the United States of America

2054
01:26:56,010 --> 01:27:01,950
has health care access and has access to

2055
01:26:57,930 --> 01:27:06,570
a healthy lifestyle he's gonna be a very

2056
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:08,340
specific case and so we may find that

2057
01:27:06,570 --> 01:27:10,650
different antibodies work differently in

2058
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:12,900
different cohorts and and that will

2059
01:27:10,650 --> 01:27:15,000
likely be the case and that's fine but

2060
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:17,719
ultimately it costs us less than five

2061
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:21,360
thousand dollars to develop this thing

2062
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:24,360
phase one and Phase two and it's even

2063
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:26,400
less of that for the cost to develop the

2064
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:28,320
the other antibodies

2065
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:31,200
you know individually so it's not really

2066
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:34,889
something that it's not really something

2067
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:39,960
we're held back from you know we um

2068
01:27:34,889 --> 01:27:41,280
we uh yeah we you know we we love

2069
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,780
support from the community you see

2070
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:44,250
something on our website that you like

2071
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:46,290
and you want to invest in you want to

2072
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:49,830
see brought some market that can help

2073
01:27:46,290 --> 01:27:52,050
you or help your family you know very

2074
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:53,820
quickly in the immediate something that

2075
01:27:52,050 --> 01:27:55,290
someone you know or love is suffering

2076
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:57,420
from you want to see that brought in

2077
01:27:55,290 --> 01:27:58,769
reality obviously you can do investment

2078
01:27:57,420 --> 01:28:01,530
you can support us and getting it there

2079
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:03,300
but ultimately no matter what we will

2080
01:28:01,530 --> 01:28:05,460
always be pushing the ball forward on

2081
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:07,679
every therapy we're working on and we'll

2082
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:10,020
make sure that it comes into reality as

2083
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:12,270
quickly as possible and that the raw

2084
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:14,610
human data confirming safety and

2085
01:28:12,270 --> 01:28:15,929
efficacy is always available to any

2086
01:28:14,610 --> 01:28:18,929
member of the public because

2087
01:28:15,929 --> 01:28:22,260
transparency is literally the last thing

2088
01:28:18,929 --> 01:28:30,330
you expect from a biomedical company and

2089
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:35,010
we are the we are we are the we are the

2090
01:28:30,330 --> 01:28:37,769
I can't think of a good a good way to

2091
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:41,730
phrase that but obviously we're not like

2092
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:43,650
those folks we are we we're not a we're

2093
01:28:41,730 --> 01:28:45,959
not tied into the the kind of model that

2094
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:48,809
requires complication and delay it's a

2095
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:51,750
profit we're tied into the idea that we

2096
01:28:48,810 --> 01:28:53,460
our families our loved ones our fathers

2097
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:55,889
and mothers and grandparents will be

2098
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:58,380
much better off when we can defeat the

2099
01:28:55,889 --> 01:29:00,690
diseases of Aging terminal and chronic

2100
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:03,179
disease and infectious disease as

2101
01:29:00,690 --> 01:29:06,150
quickly as possible

2102
01:29:03,179 --> 01:29:08,730
you know we just want would like you we

2103
01:29:06,150 --> 01:29:10,589
want to feel safe and secure and we

2104
01:29:08,730 --> 01:29:13,769
don't want to have to worry about our

2105
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:15,929
parents or our loved ones winding up in

2106
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:17,760
the hospital and then you like you know

2107
01:29:15,929 --> 01:29:21,420
the doctor comes in and he tells you

2108
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:23,340
there's nothing we can do but if you pay

2109
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:25,050
us you know five thousand dollars a day

2110
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:26,550
we can keep them on life support and

2111
01:29:25,050 --> 01:29:28,940
maybe we can do something later on

2112
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:32,070
because that kind of mixed messaging is

2113
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:34,110
 and it's nothing that anybody

2114
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:37,590
in the world deserves in terms of health

2115
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:41,190
care and it's a form of dependence truly

2116
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:46,880
that keeps us away from where we should

2117
01:29:41,190 --> 01:29:46,879
be as a species okay thank you

2118
01:29:47,690 --> 01:29:54,809
so I'm kind of like a lightning flash

2119
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:57,270
demo sound like a lightning demo deal

2120
01:29:54,810 --> 01:29:59,810
with it it's good it's like you're in

2121
01:29:57,270 --> 01:30:04,350
that room and this room at the same time

2122
01:29:59,810 --> 01:30:07,380
and my name is Matt Freese and I am here

2123
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:09,960
to talk about the piece I did yesterday

2124
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:12,540
at the performance piece I am a artist

2125
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:14,310
who makes interactive musical sculptures

2126
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:20,730
that either generate music or light

2127
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:22,410
based on user interaction so all these

2128
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:25,290
buttons does it there you go

2129
01:30:22,410 --> 01:30:29,460
but you may have seen someone using this

2130
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:31,950
device yesterday and you being the

2131
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:33,780
observer that you are likely developed a

2132
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:36,239
couple theories as to how it works and

2133
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:39,059
I'm here to validate and/or discredit

2134
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:42,139
those theories and I will start with

2135
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:45,510
defining did I break it

2136
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:47,550
am i so loud yeah good I will start with

2137
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:49,110
defining a cybernetic system and I think

2138
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:50,700
a good place to start with anything is

2139
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:54,139
with William Gibson so I think we're

2140
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:58,230
gonna go ahead and do that right now and

2141
01:30:54,140 --> 01:31:00,480
he once had to say that a cyber is from

2142
01:30:58,230 --> 01:31:03,450
the Greek word for navigator and Norbert

2143
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:05,129
Weiner coin cybernetics around 1948 to

2144
01:31:03,450 --> 01:31:07,650
denote the study of teleological

2145
01:31:05,130 --> 01:31:10,230
mechanisms and I think it is this

2146
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:12,900
concept of a goal-oriented system being

2147
01:31:10,230 --> 01:31:14,849
navigated by the system itself I've got

2148
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:16,259
many tangents of exploration that led to

2149
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:18,630
a lot of things we're currently using in

2150
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:21,600
our society in day to day life because

2151
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:24,450
to have a goal the system in question

2152
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:26,850
has to be able to recognize interpret

2153
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:28,320
and analyze this environment to

2154
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:32,040
communicate with its environment and

2155
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:34,429
itself to assess its actions and orient

2156
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:37,260
its actions to its desired effect and

2157
01:31:34,430 --> 01:31:39,660
the implications of this while

2158
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:42,420
commonplace to us now are were and are

2159
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:46,950
astonishing and to hear from Weiner

2160
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:48,570
himself cybernetics is the scientific

2161
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:51,559
study of control and communication in

2162
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:54,000
the animal and the machine and

2163
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:56,070
cybernetics is a very broad term

2164
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,800
describing a very broad field and has

2165
01:31:56,070 --> 01:32:00,360
like many other words sprung into being

2166
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:02,520
in the mid 20th century

2167
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:04,920
often applied or appropriated to field

2168
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:06,990
beyond its scope and there has been a

2169
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:09,060
lot written and defined in this field of

2170
01:32:06,990 --> 01:32:10,469
cybernetics but one thing that is

2171
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:12,300
essential to the operation of any

2172
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:15,480
cybernetic system is that it is a closed

2173
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:17,370
signaling feedback loop wherein the

2174
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:19,469
system's outputs affect its environment

2175
01:32:17,370 --> 01:32:22,610
which it receives as a subsequent input

2176
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:25,380
which affects its subsequent output a

2177
01:32:22,610 --> 01:32:27,330
feedback loop we should be easily

2178
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:31,830
modeled through this wonderful diagram

2179
01:32:27,330 --> 01:32:33,809
and this idea of the close signal

2180
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:36,180
feedback loop as much as anything else

2181
01:32:33,810 --> 01:32:39,660
of course has many applications beyond

2182
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:41,580
itself and particularly I think one of

2183
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:44,250
the dedications is to music in this

2184
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:46,170
composition and performance far beyond

2185
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:48,180
the guitar amps feedback which is

2186
01:32:46,170 --> 01:32:53,130
already totally awesome but I think we

2187
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:54,870
can do a little better than that and so

2188
01:32:53,130 --> 01:32:58,050
we designed the Illuma motion wearable

2189
01:32:54,870 --> 01:33:00,300
synthesizer and it is an example of a

2190
01:32:58,050 --> 01:33:02,760
cybernetic system wherein a dancer

2191
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:05,520
generates the music to which they dance

2192
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:07,200
by the act of them dancing and I mean

2193
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:09,960
I'm intrigued by this concept of a

2194
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:11,849
composition being composed through the

2195
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:14,640
act of its conduction the ethic being

2196
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:17,430
conducted and so now we're at the good

2197
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:20,610
parts the guts right talk about how this

2198
01:33:17,430 --> 01:33:22,520
thing works and it's it's very simply

2199
01:33:20,610 --> 01:33:27,000
four square wave of oscillators

2200
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:29,130
controlled by the arms and the legs two

2201
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,600
of them for each respectively and the

2202
01:33:29,130 --> 01:33:33,840
dancer is equipped with a light sensor

2203
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:36,300
on each palm and each shin and for this

2204
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:37,590
project I'm using photo resistors which

2205
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:40,530
are super awesome super simple

2206
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:42,060
components which can vary levels of

2207
01:33:40,530 --> 01:33:43,830
resistance being read by the circuit as

2208
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:45,240
if a knobs if you can imagine a knob

2209
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:47,040
turn always to the left that's

2210
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:48,120
completely dark moving you would see

2211
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,130
with a photo resistor all the way to the

2212
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:53,580
right it's good right light directly be

2213
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:55,790
received by it and these four

2214
01:33:53,580 --> 01:33:59,070
photoresistors that's a picture of one

2215
01:33:55,790 --> 01:34:01,320
if you wanted to see and these four

2216
01:33:59,070 --> 01:34:04,530
photo resistors control either the pitch

2217
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:05,730
or the rate of the two oscillators by

2218
01:34:04,530 --> 01:34:09,080
either moving the right or the left

2219
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:11,250
appendages of the body respectively and

2220
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:14,100
interesting audio effects can be

2221
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:17,910
generated by differing the fourth

2222
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:19,950
to a light source and to make the most

2223
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:21,780
interesting possible positioning of

2224
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:24,300
these sensors I chose the human bodies

2225
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:26,550
appendages because incredibly opposable

2226
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:28,650
and dynamically positionable in real

2227
01:34:26,550 --> 01:34:30,870
time and I think this is a pretty cool

2228
01:34:28,650 --> 01:34:34,219
machine or got by default that we can

2229
01:34:30,870 --> 01:34:36,660
exploit and so here's a breakdown so

2230
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:39,720
that the sounds you were hearing can be

2231
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:41,970
thought of as two tones one from the

2232
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:44,370
arms and one from the legs and right

2233
01:34:41,970 --> 01:34:45,960
here I've got a highlight of these the

2234
01:34:44,370 --> 01:34:47,250
top half of the legs with a little

2235
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:49,350
schematic of the two squared of

2236
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:51,450
oscillators functioning do you look at

2237
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:52,530
the bottom little L going on the little

2238
01:34:51,450 --> 01:34:54,179
circle the squiggly that's a

2239
01:34:52,530 --> 01:34:56,550
photoresistor which controls the pitch

2240
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:58,440
of the feedback loop which is generating

2241
01:34:56,550 --> 01:35:00,090
the oscillation which is a little bit

2242
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:01,320
meta there's an embedded feedback loop

2243
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:05,280
inside of the feedback loop that's going

2244
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:09,750
on and the same goes for the legs which

2245
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:12,360
have the same system operating and I

2246
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:15,180
have further separated the body into

2247
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:16,710
left and right columns where these your

2248
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:17,670
arms and your legs control through tones

2249
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:21,270
with the right half of your body

2250
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:23,040
controls an LFO which gates on or off

2251
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:24,180
the second off swing on the left hand of

2252
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:26,940
the body which controls the pitch

2253
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:34,050
depending on its light sensor reading

2254
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:35,669
and when you can dynamically control

2255
01:35:34,050 --> 01:35:38,780
these things interesting audio effects

2256
01:35:35,670 --> 01:35:47,550
can occur and I will demonstrate for you

2257
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:49,710
briefly some of these that you see right

2258
01:35:47,550 --> 01:35:52,910
now with my depending on the finishing

2259
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:56,250
of my legs in relation to a light source

2260
01:35:52,910 --> 01:36:00,800
every time it turns off right now moving

2261
01:35:56,250 --> 01:36:00,800
my foot forward turned up a little bit

2262
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:19,530
maximum it's very slow rate of

2263
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:21,380
oscillation you can only hear my

2264
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:23,670
synthesizer

2265
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:25,070
which speaks for me more than anything

2266
01:36:23,670 --> 01:36:28,050
in my back

2267
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:29,159
wonderful so saying

2268
01:36:28,050 --> 01:36:31,290
I don't know how much you heard before

2269
01:36:29,159 --> 01:36:33,388
it cut off but moving the right hand of

2270
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:36,239
my body the right time my body controls

2271
01:36:33,389 --> 01:36:37,679
the rate of the oscillation in this

2272
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:40,619
segment right that's my body controls

2273
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:42,360
the pitch so you can get some really

2274
01:36:40,619 --> 01:36:44,190
interesting dynamic control of this and

2275
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:46,290
the applications of this in musical

2276
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:49,320
composition are I think really

2277
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:52,170
interesting because you could have say a

2278
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:54,900
drum track generated that's making a

2279
01:36:52,170 --> 01:36:57,030
series of drum breaks and have a dancer

2280
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:59,848
in real-time controlling a bassline in

2281
01:36:57,030 --> 01:37:01,409
response to that the drum breaks that

2282
01:36:59,849 --> 01:37:04,260
you were hearing and this creates for I

2283
01:37:01,409 --> 01:37:09,179
think a more intuitive an actualize the

2284
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:10,820
interface to actively express what

2285
01:37:09,179 --> 01:37:13,170
you're trying to do with your sound and

2286
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:16,739
all of this is of course happening in

2287
01:37:13,170 --> 01:37:18,030
the user's brain wherein you are moving

2288
01:37:16,739 --> 01:37:20,159
and generating the music that you hear

2289
01:37:18,030 --> 01:37:22,619
and the user hears what's being made and

2290
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:25,409
compares it to a goal of their sonic

2291
01:37:22,619 --> 01:37:27,119
intention if you will and the user will

2292
01:37:25,409 --> 01:37:29,159
adapt their behavior to actualize this

2293
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:31,110
goal and to alter the sound to which

2294
01:37:29,159 --> 01:37:33,629
they continue to dance and they repeat

2295
01:37:31,110 --> 01:37:36,299
this indefinitely essentially a closed

2296
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:38,190
feedback loop and this is all happening

2297
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:40,619
in the mind faster than the user can

2298
01:37:38,190 --> 01:37:41,848
possibly perceive and it's this fact

2299
01:37:40,619 --> 01:37:43,348
that is happening subconsciously that

2300
01:37:41,849 --> 01:37:45,210
creates that a really intuitive

2301
01:37:43,349 --> 01:37:47,599
interface instead of having this be a

2302
01:37:45,210 --> 01:37:52,110
consciously deliberated and thought out

2303
01:37:47,599 --> 01:37:56,219
method and here's the thing about the

2304
01:37:52,110 --> 01:38:02,009
schematic as phenomenal as it is it's

2305
01:37:56,219 --> 01:38:05,369
very very simple circuit and here is the

2306
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:08,880
schematic for it I encourage you to take

2307
01:38:05,369 --> 01:38:11,820
a photograph of this and to take it home

2308
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,989
and build it yourself and if you do not

2309
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:15,179
believe that you can build this

2310
01:38:12,989 --> 01:38:16,919
schematic I even further encourage you

2311
01:38:15,179 --> 01:38:19,800
to stop believing that as it is simply

2312
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:22,199
untrue and the only thing separating you

2313
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:25,590
from building this is to really truly

2314
01:38:22,199 --> 01:38:28,110
actually decide to do it and if you

2315
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:29,550
decide to please speak to me after this

2316
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:33,058
and I would love to share some resources

2317
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:35,010
with you such as a wonderful book by

2318
01:38:33,059 --> 01:38:36,750
nicholas collins who teaches at the

2319
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:39,329
artists in chicago this is a handmade

2320
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:41,099
electronic music and the circuit that i

2321
01:38:39,329 --> 01:38:41,938
just showed you was derived from a circa

2322
01:38:41,099 --> 01:38:44,400
in his book

2323
01:38:41,939 --> 01:38:47,639
using a 4106 logic gate chip which puts

2324
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:48,959
out a 0 or a 1 to compute simple logic

2325
01:38:47,639 --> 01:38:56,459
functions but run through an amplifier I

2326
01:38:48,959 --> 01:38:58,679
can create audio and the point of the

2327
01:38:56,459 --> 01:39:00,539
Illuma motion is that it's a prototype

2328
01:38:58,679 --> 01:39:02,489
to express this thought experiment of

2329
01:39:00,539 --> 01:39:04,709
musical performance as a cybernetic

2330
01:39:02,489 --> 01:39:07,619
system using the body with musical

2331
01:39:04,709 --> 01:39:10,050
performance and there are undoubtedly

2332
01:39:07,619 --> 01:39:12,509
far more advanced wearable music

2333
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:15,209
wearable music making technology and

2334
01:39:12,510 --> 01:39:19,199
there are nearly infinite ways to scale

2335
01:39:15,209 --> 01:39:21,449
this concept up for instance as Katya

2336
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:22,530
was touching on with her conductive hair

2337
01:39:21,449 --> 01:39:24,860
and nail technology could you imagine

2338
01:39:22,530 --> 01:39:27,929
that a violin concerto in which the

2339
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:30,058
violinist or the cello can interact with

2340
01:39:27,929 --> 01:39:34,409
the composition in real time based on

2341
01:39:30,059 --> 01:39:36,599
sensory input and but my favorite part

2342
01:39:34,409 --> 01:39:39,089
about the circuit is simply the fact

2343
01:39:36,599 --> 01:39:41,519
that it is in fact simple this wonderful

2344
01:39:39,090 --> 01:39:44,610
schematic can achieve this fantastical

2345
01:39:41,519 --> 01:39:47,579
effect with little to no advanced

2346
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:50,369
components or really scary electrical

2347
01:39:47,579 --> 01:39:52,768
Theory like you could pick this up in a

2348
01:39:50,369 --> 01:39:54,630
week and the fact that this achieves

2349
01:39:52,769 --> 01:39:56,039
such a fascinating effect of manifesting

2350
01:39:54,630 --> 01:39:57,630
a cybernetic system in which a closed

2351
01:39:56,039 --> 01:40:00,268
signaling loop is actually actualize

2352
01:39:57,630 --> 01:40:02,429
between the body the medium the artist

2353
01:40:00,269 --> 01:40:05,519
and the sound and it's in ascetically

2354
01:40:02,429 --> 01:40:09,630
weaves light with sound but it is a very

2355
01:40:05,519 --> 01:40:14,090
simplest accessible schematic and I hope

2356
01:40:09,630 --> 01:40:14,090
you find that inspiring thank you

2357
01:40:16,459 --> 01:40:24,269
questions I'll take questions if anyone

2358
01:40:20,669 --> 01:40:24,900
has and in this microphone here yeah any

2359
01:40:24,269 --> 01:40:28,610
questions

2360
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:28,610
oh there you are over there thank you

2361
01:40:29,659 --> 01:40:35,789
yes so a theremin that is exploiting

2362
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:38,669
electromagnetic waves so instead of

2363
01:40:35,789 --> 01:40:41,789
using light sensors to control pitch and

2364
01:40:38,669 --> 01:40:43,800
volume well I guess mine is controlling

2365
01:40:41,789 --> 01:40:45,570
pitch and rate if you will of two

2366
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:47,760
oscillators but very similar effect

2367
01:40:45,570 --> 01:40:49,799
where this where the right side of the

2368
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:51,300
body control volume in this control

2369
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:53,760
pitch it would be very much modeled

2370
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:55,829
after a theremin but we're exploiting a

2371
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:57,840
light instead of electromagnetic wave

2372
01:40:55,829 --> 01:41:08,699
which is less cool but still totally

2373
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:12,659
cool anybody else do you have any more

2374
01:41:08,699 --> 01:41:15,269
projects like this planned indeed so

2375
01:41:12,659 --> 01:41:18,360
this one was devised for performance I

2376
01:41:15,270 --> 01:41:19,500
did with the Houston Ballet Company for

2377
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:21,389
benefit show and so that's when I

2378
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:23,639
started thinking about using the human

2379
01:41:21,389 --> 01:41:27,420
body to conduct sound in a medium that

2380
01:41:23,639 --> 01:41:30,440
is familiar to a body user like a dancer

2381
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:32,699
much more than I can use my body and

2382
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:33,629
from that process and I started thinking

2383
01:41:32,699 --> 01:41:36,030
about other ways that this could be

2384
01:41:33,630 --> 01:41:38,460
intuitively used to control sound like

2385
01:41:36,030 --> 01:41:41,280
the example I gave of a track being made

2386
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:44,150
with a drumline predetermined and pre

2387
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:46,699
played but the bassline or other

2388
01:41:44,150 --> 01:41:49,980
component of the song being live

2389
01:41:46,699 --> 01:41:52,589
generated by the action of the performer

2390
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:54,150
performing so I guess that would be the

2391
01:41:52,590 --> 01:41:55,860
further application of this but all the

2392
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:57,509
things I do kind of inhabit the space of

2393
01:41:55,860 --> 01:42:00,199
a cybernetic system existing between the

2394
01:41:57,510 --> 01:42:03,000
user and the artwork and themselves

2395
01:42:00,199 --> 01:42:05,638
interacting and altering the behavior to

2396
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:15,739
create a grander aesthetic effect if you

2397
01:42:05,639 --> 01:42:15,739
will anybody else okay thank you Thanks

2398
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:21,598
how many of you have ever taken a

2399
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:24,860
psychoactive substance just raise your

2400
01:42:21,599 --> 01:42:27,329
hand I'm curious no one's gonna yeah

2401
01:42:24,860 --> 01:42:29,820
okay how many of you have taken a

2402
01:42:27,329 --> 01:42:31,290
psychoactive substance or have taken and

2403
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:33,989
I'm talking about any psychoactive stuff

2404
01:42:31,290 --> 01:42:36,090
is caffeine counts how many of you have

2405
01:42:33,989 --> 01:42:38,489
taken a psychoactive substance and had a

2406
01:42:36,090 --> 01:42:40,380
different response than one of your

2407
01:42:38,489 --> 01:42:45,388
friends or have your friends have a

2408
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:47,400
different response yeah so I'm gonna

2409
01:42:45,389 --> 01:42:49,050
talk today about how your jeans shape

2410
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:50,429
your response to cannabis and we're

2411
01:42:49,050 --> 01:42:53,070
gonna talk about cannabis in in

2412
01:42:50,429 --> 01:42:54,690
particular and use that as a way to

2413
01:42:53,070 --> 01:42:57,530
extrapolate how we might be able to

2414
01:42:54,690 --> 01:43:00,540
design customize and personalize

2415
01:42:57,530 --> 01:43:03,150
psychoactive substances in the future so

2416
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:04,409
I want to start out well we'll start out

2417
01:43:03,150 --> 01:43:08,129
with a meme because that's how I have

2418
01:43:04,409 --> 01:43:10,200
everything good starts but you can see

2419
01:43:08,130 --> 01:43:12,330
the progression over time here

2420
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:14,940
everything from marijuana's for thieves

2421
01:43:12,330 --> 01:43:17,970
rapists and jazz musicians which we all

2422
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:20,250
know is true to cannabis might have some

2423
01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:23,600
medical uses it's a plant that's evolved

2424
01:43:20,250 --> 01:43:26,940
with our endocannabinoid system over

2425
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:28,620
thousands of millions of years two

2426
01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:30,299
different strains have different effects

2427
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:32,400
here you know tried this it's a sativa

2428
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:34,020
you're gonna experience something

2429
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:37,049
slightly different than an indica strain

2430
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:38,250
two common variations in DNA caused

2431
01:43:37,050 --> 01:43:39,870
people to respond to cannabis

2432
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:43,530
differently and I want to present this

2433
01:43:39,870 --> 01:43:44,910
idea so that as you you know go

2434
01:43:43,530 --> 01:43:48,450
throughout your life you know take

2435
01:43:44,910 --> 01:43:50,490
whatever you enjoy we can start to have

2436
01:43:48,450 --> 01:43:53,429
a conversation about why people respond

2437
01:43:50,490 --> 01:43:55,519
differently and what that means so I

2438
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:58,080
just want to go over a couple

2439
01:43:55,520 --> 01:44:00,720
conflicting study results okay they're

2440
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:02,250
very striking differences very heavy use

2441
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:03,930
of marijuana is associated with

2442
01:44:02,250 --> 01:44:05,700
persistent decrements and cognitive

2443
01:44:03,930 --> 01:44:08,670
performance even after 28 days of

2444
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:10,290
abstinence study - and this is this is

2445
01:44:08,670 --> 01:44:13,050
taken from a summary of an abstract

2446
01:44:10,290 --> 01:44:14,880
study - it appears that that the abuse

2447
01:44:13,050 --> 01:44:19,050
of cannabis has no confounding effects

2448
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:20,430
on cognition okay study study three more

2449
01:44:19,050 --> 01:44:22,590
frequent cannabis use was associated

2450
01:44:20,430 --> 01:44:25,470
with better performance in attention and

2451
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:26,910
working memory tasks so you know right

2452
01:44:25,470 --> 01:44:30,900
here we can see there's something going

2453
01:44:26,910 --> 01:44:34,500
on and you know what's the deal its bias

2454
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:36,540
may be poor study design small sample

2455
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:38,070
size I'm gonna argue that none of those

2456
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:39,900
studies were looking at genetic

2457
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:41,910
variables which might confound the

2458
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:45,150
results depending on what population

2459
01:44:41,910 --> 01:44:47,700
you're looking at so I want to talk to

2460
01:44:45,150 --> 01:44:50,040
you first about snips just so you have a

2461
01:44:47,700 --> 01:44:52,139
quick background and all of these

2462
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:54,810
studies that I'm gonna reference here

2463
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:57,390
are looking at single nucleotide

2464
01:44:54,810 --> 01:45:01,050
variations in DNA and how those

2465
01:44:57,390 --> 01:45:03,450
variations affect the proteins that get

2466
01:45:01,050 --> 01:45:06,120
expressed by those genes and then how

2467
01:45:03,450 --> 01:45:09,780
those proteins go and create traits and

2468
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:12,750
different metabolic variables so as you

2469
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:14,460
can see it's simply just a one letter

2470
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:17,340
swap in the code and these things are

2471
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:19,950
very common these aren't actually

2472
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:21,630
mutations they may be used to be

2473
01:45:19,950 --> 01:45:23,250
mutations but now they've found their

2474
01:45:21,630 --> 01:45:25,980
way into you know half

2475
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:28,500
population or a quarter of it and it's

2476
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:31,620
just what makes you you and what makes

2477
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:33,870
me mean so yeah they there's over 10

2478
01:45:31,620 --> 01:45:35,220
million snips that we know of and snip

2479
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:36,870
stands for single nucleotide

2480
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:38,250
polymorphisms so I'm gonna use the word

2481
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:41,910
snip and I just want to get a clearer

2482
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:43,680
definition for a move on yeah so snips

2483
01:45:41,910 --> 01:45:46,740
are not mutations they're just common

2484
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:47,970
genetic variables and just to give you a

2485
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:50,040
little bit of background I'm an

2486
01:45:47,970 --> 01:45:52,440
epigenetic coach I work with clients to

2487
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:56,280
help them understand you know what type

2488
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:58,349
of nutrition supplements lifestyle

2489
01:45:56,280 --> 01:46:01,889
choices match up with their DNA to

2490
01:45:58,350 --> 01:46:04,020
create optimal health outcomes and I'm

2491
01:46:01,890 --> 01:46:09,330
personally interested in cannabis so two

2492
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:10,830
things kind of match up nicely and thus

2493
01:46:09,330 --> 01:46:13,320
that whole field is called neutral

2494
01:46:10,830 --> 01:46:15,630
genetics and nutrigenomics neutral

2495
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:17,849
genetics is how our genes impact a

2496
01:46:15,630 --> 01:46:21,030
response to food and then nutrigenomics

2497
01:46:17,850 --> 01:46:22,710
is how food and other substances impact

2498
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:25,559
our genetic expression it's a subtle

2499
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:29,580
difference but it's important to kind of

2500
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:30,930
know that difference and can we apply

2501
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:34,170
those principles to psychoactive

2502
01:46:30,930 --> 01:46:37,170
substances I say absolutely yes and that

2503
01:46:34,170 --> 01:46:38,850
is going to be the future and I you know

2504
01:46:37,170 --> 01:46:42,420
I think we're all here because at some

2505
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:44,640
level we believe in bodily autonomy the

2506
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:45,720
sovereignty to you know make your own

2507
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:47,910
choices about what you put in your body

2508
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:50,280
so whether you're putting magnets in

2509
01:46:47,910 --> 01:46:52,410
your body or you're putting DMT in your

2510
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:53,670
body you know there's a common thread I

2511
01:46:52,410 --> 01:46:55,349
think that really weaves those two

2512
01:46:53,670 --> 01:46:59,490
things together in term in terms of

2513
01:46:55,350 --> 01:47:02,100
having agency so I just want to give you

2514
01:46:59,490 --> 01:47:06,599
a quick example snip and this is a

2515
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:10,200
caffeine there's a enzyme in the liver

2516
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:14,370
that breaks down caffeine called cyp COF

2517
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:15,750
b1 a2 and there's kind of two groups

2518
01:47:14,370 --> 01:47:18,120
that have been identified fast

2519
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:20,250
metabolizers and slow metabolizers of

2520
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:21,809
caffeine and this one lettered variation

2521
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:24,830
creates those differences in the way

2522
01:47:21,810 --> 01:47:29,100
that the enzyme breaks down caffeine and

2523
01:47:24,830 --> 01:47:31,380
people with two A's in their DNA two

2524
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:33,780
alleles a they're considered fast

2525
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:35,910
metabolizers and then if you have an AC

2526
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:36,929
or cc in that particular place in your

2527
01:47:35,910 --> 01:47:40,860
genome

2528
01:47:36,929 --> 01:47:42,630
you break down caffeine much slower what

2529
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:45,659
does that actually mean well it turns

2530
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:47,189
out that it's a pretty important

2531
01:47:45,659 --> 01:47:50,280
variable that can really create some

2532
01:47:47,189 --> 01:47:53,760
long-term health consequences so this is

2533
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:55,139
from a study done in 2006 looking at the

2534
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:57,539
risk of hypertension and heart disease

2535
01:47:55,139 --> 01:47:59,729
in relation to caffeine stratified by

2536
01:47:57,539 --> 01:48:02,070
this genetic variable so you can see

2537
01:47:59,729 --> 01:48:06,329
with on the left side you have the a a

2538
01:48:02,070 --> 01:48:08,518
fast metabolizer genotype and their risk

2539
01:48:06,329 --> 01:48:11,579
for cardiac disease actually goes down

2540
01:48:08,519 --> 01:48:13,889
when they drink caffeine it starts out

2541
01:48:11,579 --> 01:48:15,719
one cup a day both both variables about

2542
01:48:13,889 --> 01:48:17,969
the same risk but if you're a slow

2543
01:48:15,719 --> 01:48:19,889
metabolizer and you drink more than one

2544
01:48:17,969 --> 01:48:21,869
cup of caffeine cup of coffee the

2545
01:48:19,889 --> 01:48:24,360
equivalent of caffeine a day your heart

2546
01:48:21,869 --> 01:48:26,969
risk for heart attack and high blood

2547
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:29,969
pressure actually can go up by by four

2548
01:48:26,969 --> 01:48:33,150
times so just looking at this as an

2549
01:48:29,969 --> 01:48:34,920
example you know the same substance is

2550
01:48:33,150 --> 01:48:37,499
gonna affect people very differently and

2551
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:41,039
you know you might want to know which

2552
01:48:37,499 --> 01:48:43,999
gene variant you have right and so just

2553
01:48:41,039 --> 01:48:46,639
to illustrate that snip goes into

2554
01:48:43,999 --> 01:48:49,709
creating different genes and proteins

2555
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:51,479
that which go into creating cell process

2556
01:48:49,709 --> 01:48:53,699
which then go into creating a trait and

2557
01:48:51,479 --> 01:48:55,530
you can think about you know hair color

2558
01:48:53,699 --> 01:48:58,199
is a really nice way to think about that

2559
01:48:55,530 --> 01:49:00,659
now imagine every single cellular

2560
01:48:58,199 --> 01:49:03,539
process in your body having that same

2561
01:49:00,659 --> 01:49:04,670
type of variability and that's when we

2562
01:49:03,539 --> 01:49:08,039
start talking about individual

2563
01:49:04,670 --> 01:49:11,070
metabolism I just think it's super

2564
01:49:08,039 --> 01:49:15,300
fascinating so it's getting to cannabis

2565
01:49:11,070 --> 01:49:17,549
so the research on cannabis has been

2566
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:20,939
limited you know obviously for legal

2567
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:22,170
reasons so comparatively to caffeine

2568
01:49:20,939 --> 01:49:24,059
which is one of the most researched

2569
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:29,539
substances in the world there's only a

2570
01:49:24,059 --> 01:49:31,409
handful of studies to even draw from but

2571
01:49:29,539 --> 01:49:34,499
compared to lead to other psychoactive

2572
01:49:31,409 --> 01:49:37,530
substances kind of cannabis has the most

2573
01:49:34,499 --> 01:49:40,349
data on it right now so you know what do

2574
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:42,599
we know what genes do we know about that

2575
01:49:40,349 --> 01:49:44,999
impact our response THC which is the

2576
01:49:42,599 --> 01:49:46,650
main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis

2577
01:49:44,999 --> 01:49:47,849
we know that there's certain genes that

2578
01:49:46,650 --> 01:49:50,308
are responsible for breaking it down

2579
01:49:47,849 --> 01:49:53,489
very similar to caffeine

2580
01:49:50,309 --> 01:49:56,079
endocannabinoid genes we have a

2581
01:49:53,489 --> 01:49:59,919
cannabinoid receptors in our body and we

2582
01:49:56,079 --> 01:50:01,239
have our own endogenous molecules that

2583
01:49:59,919 --> 01:50:02,590
bind to those receptors and there's

2584
01:50:01,239 --> 01:50:05,259
certain variations that create

2585
01:50:02,590 --> 01:50:09,489
differences dopamine reward and response

2586
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:11,800
genes also play a role and you know most

2587
01:50:09,489 --> 01:50:12,968
also to you know just keep in mind as

2588
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:15,579
I'm going through this this these

2589
01:50:12,969 --> 01:50:16,869
research these research studies most of

2590
01:50:15,579 --> 01:50:19,239
them are approaching it from an

2591
01:50:16,869 --> 01:50:21,369
addiction standpoint so they're looking

2592
01:50:19,239 --> 01:50:24,549
at things that are related to it being a

2593
01:50:21,369 --> 01:50:27,789
problematic behavior I'm gonna reframe

2594
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:30,699
that a little bit the way I'm gonna

2595
01:50:27,789 --> 01:50:33,369
approach the data that they got but

2596
01:50:30,699 --> 01:50:35,320
let's talk about cyp2c9 so this is a

2597
01:50:33,369 --> 01:50:37,089
very similar liver enzyme to the

2598
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:39,130
caffeine gene we just talked about and

2599
01:50:37,090 --> 01:50:42,239
what it does is it break down it breaks

2600
01:50:39,130 --> 01:50:45,820
down THC into its non psychoactive form

2601
01:50:42,239 --> 01:50:48,039
so what does that mean well it

2602
01:50:45,820 --> 01:50:51,249
influences how high you get so from the

2603
01:50:48,039 --> 01:50:53,199
same amount of cannabis right and very

2604
01:50:51,249 --> 01:50:55,148
similarly to that other gene there's a

2605
01:50:53,199 --> 01:51:00,369
fast metabolizer variant and a slow

2606
01:50:55,149 --> 01:51:02,709
metabolizer barrier so the a a genotype

2607
01:51:00,369 --> 01:51:04,929
breaks down THC very efficiently this is

2608
01:51:02,709 --> 01:51:07,809
from a study this is just the average

2609
01:51:04,929 --> 01:51:10,510
amount of THC in the bloodstream over

2610
01:51:07,809 --> 01:51:13,030
time they're given 15 milligrams of oral

2611
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:15,719
THC and you can see the massive

2612
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:18,489
difference in the slow metabolizer group

2613
01:51:15,719 --> 01:51:22,709
you know they had about on average three

2614
01:51:18,489 --> 01:51:25,089
times more THC in their their body now

2615
01:51:22,709 --> 01:51:27,699
that's another way to visualize it you

2616
01:51:25,090 --> 01:51:31,419
can see the CC group on the on the very

2617
01:51:27,699 --> 01:51:33,009
edge very right there has just much

2618
01:51:31,419 --> 01:51:35,349
higher amounts in their system on

2619
01:51:33,010 --> 01:51:38,979
average so what does that mean

2620
01:51:35,349 --> 01:51:41,679
subjectively the CC carriers who don't

2621
01:51:38,979 --> 01:51:44,050
break THC down as well reported more

2622
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:46,840
drowsiness more intense effects than the

2623
01:51:44,050 --> 01:51:52,199
other two groups and that's a looking at

2624
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:52,199
a standardized kind of drowsiness score

2625
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:59,009
so just from from that one variable

2626
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,270
alone you can see that there's gonna be

2627
01:51:59,010 --> 01:52:02,460
a pretty big difference and I'm gonna

2628
01:52:00,270 --> 01:52:04,950
I'm gonna go through these really quick

2629
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:07,410
just so I can give you guys a overview

2630
01:52:04,950 --> 01:52:08,480
and if you want to look them go more in

2631
01:52:07,410 --> 01:52:10,470
depth with this I have a whole hour

2632
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:12,980
presentation that you can check out on

2633
01:52:10,470 --> 01:52:12,980
my website

2634
01:52:13,010 --> 01:52:18,600
SAH codes for something called a fatty

2635
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:21,660
acid amide hydrolase and it breaks down

2636
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:24,480
an and amide which is one of your bodies

2637
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:30,420
naturally occurring cannabinoids so

2638
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:32,519
people that have more f aah have less of

2639
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:34,500
the naturally occurring cannabinoid and

2640
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:37,500
and amide in your body and vice versa

2641
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:40,290
so this has been shown to create some

2642
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:44,520
really interesting effects as well and

2643
01:52:40,290 --> 01:52:47,430
with the the C allele which is the lower

2644
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:49,980
levels of cannabinoids these people and

2645
01:52:47,430 --> 01:52:51,510
this I'm one of these people show

2646
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:53,099
greater craving for cannabis after

2647
01:52:51,510 --> 01:52:54,870
abstinence brain scans show higher

2648
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:58,710
activation in the dopamine reward

2649
01:52:54,870 --> 01:53:01,260
centers of the brain and vice versa the

2650
01:52:58,710 --> 01:53:05,400
a allele tends to have about half the

2651
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:06,540
rate of chronic cannabis use as the C

2652
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:08,759
allele and they just have less

2653
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:12,120
preference for cannabis in general we're

2654
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:15,750
gonna talk about why that that is so

2655
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:18,840
this is a subjective reported happiness

2656
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:23,880
scale that they gave these two groups

2657
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:31,170
the the C allele and a oleum and you can

2658
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:32,880
see that the C allele reported higher

2659
01:53:31,170 --> 01:53:35,100
levels happiness from from the beginning

2660
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:36,960
and so people that had higher levels of

2661
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:39,540
their own cannabinoids reporting higher

2662
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:41,070
you know they felt happier and

2663
01:53:39,540 --> 01:53:43,230
vice-versa people that had lower over

2664
01:53:41,070 --> 01:53:46,049
their owns lower their own cannabinoids

2665
01:53:43,230 --> 01:53:48,419
reported lower happiness and after they

2666
01:53:46,050 --> 01:53:55,140
smoked cannabis within 60 minutes that

2667
01:53:48,420 --> 01:54:03,000
had switched and same thing here with

2668
01:53:55,140 --> 01:54:05,700
the the C group they reported much much

2669
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:07,350
higher levels of craving after stopping

2670
01:54:05,700 --> 01:54:07,949
cannabis for I think it was a couple

2671
01:54:07,350 --> 01:54:10,050
weeks

2672
01:54:07,949 --> 01:54:11,610
and the group that already had higher

2673
01:54:10,050 --> 01:54:18,300
levels of their endogenous cannabinoids

2674
01:54:11,610 --> 01:54:19,739
didn't seem to care and to talk about

2675
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:21,420
why that might be well if you already

2676
01:54:19,739 --> 01:54:23,400
have higher levels of your own

2677
01:54:21,420 --> 01:54:25,499
endogenous cannabinoids that are

2678
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:28,709
activating those receptors

2679
01:54:25,499 --> 01:54:30,478
you know perhaps load overloading that

2680
01:54:28,709 --> 01:54:32,820
system with a bunch of THC that's going

2681
01:54:30,479 --> 01:54:34,979
to over activate those receptors is

2682
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:36,690
going to throw you off balance where if

2683
01:54:34,979 --> 01:54:39,059
you have a lower amount of those

2684
01:54:36,690 --> 01:54:40,379
cannabinoids to begin with adding some

2685
01:54:39,059 --> 01:54:42,479
in might be a good idea to kind of

2686
01:54:40,380 --> 01:54:45,510
balance things out so you really see I

2687
01:54:42,479 --> 01:54:53,400
mean it's a pretty strong genetic

2688
01:54:45,510 --> 01:54:55,110
variable there ATK one this is it acts

2689
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:56,400
as a signaling molecule in the dopamine

2690
01:54:55,110 --> 01:54:58,889
pathway and what they found is this

2691
01:54:56,400 --> 01:55:02,159
really influences how psychedelic of an

2692
01:54:58,889 --> 01:55:03,840
effect you get from cannabis the way

2693
01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:07,348
they phrased it in the study was Suketu

2694
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:08,760
mimetic meaning mimicking psychosis but

2695
01:55:07,349 --> 01:55:11,159
really what they're talking about is

2696
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:13,380
things that mimic the psychedelic

2697
01:55:11,159 --> 01:55:16,709
experience you know

2698
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:20,880
time distortion visuals paranoia kind of

2699
01:55:16,709 --> 01:55:27,239
thing and so here again you can see on

2700
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:30,329
the very left the TG variant had lower

2701
01:55:27,239 --> 01:55:32,610
lower reported psychedelic type of facts

2702
01:55:30,329 --> 01:55:37,920
from cannabis and then the CT group in

2703
01:55:32,610 --> 01:55:40,409
the middle had the highest and then when

2704
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:42,539
you combine that gene with another gene

2705
01:55:40,409 --> 01:55:45,749
grd 2 which is a dopamine receptor gene

2706
01:55:42,539 --> 01:55:49,320
you actually get this very interesting

2707
01:55:45,749 --> 01:55:51,329
stratification of people developing

2708
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:53,070
psychotic symptoms from smoking cannabis

2709
01:55:51,329 --> 01:55:56,190
and I don't know about you but I've had

2710
01:55:53,070 --> 01:55:57,989
some people that I know developed and

2711
01:55:56,190 --> 01:55:59,848
released you know have really strange

2712
01:55:57,989 --> 01:56:02,150
reactions to it where you're like man

2713
01:55:59,849 --> 01:56:09,389
you probably shouldn't be doing that

2714
01:56:02,150 --> 01:56:13,228
chill out oh so yeah there's one variant

2715
01:56:09,389 --> 01:56:14,400
of this of this gene two times the

2716
01:56:13,229 --> 01:56:16,170
likelihood of being diagnosed with a

2717
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:20,860
psychotic disorder with daily cannabis

2718
01:56:16,170 --> 01:56:24,190
use or 7.x with daily 2x just lifetime

2719
01:56:20,860 --> 01:56:27,518
and there's a there's a chart there and

2720
01:56:24,190 --> 01:56:29,739
you can actually see with no cannabis

2721
01:56:27,519 --> 01:56:32,860
use the the the risk allele for having

2722
01:56:29,739 --> 01:56:35,440
those psychotic symptoms actually goes

2723
01:56:32,860 --> 01:56:38,049
down but with cannabis use it goes up

2724
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:40,780
tremendously so the reason I bring this

2725
01:56:38,050 --> 01:56:42,579
up is because while I'm a cannabis

2726
01:56:40,780 --> 01:56:43,509
enthusiast and I enjoy it I think it's

2727
01:56:42,579 --> 01:56:47,320
important to have a balanced

2728
01:56:43,510 --> 01:56:50,710
conversation around you know somewhere

2729
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:53,768
in between the notion that marijuana is

2730
01:56:50,710 --> 01:56:55,929
for rapists and jazz musicians and you

2731
01:56:53,769 --> 01:56:58,150
know it's the cure for everything and so

2732
01:56:55,929 --> 01:57:00,070
for certain people it is very very

2733
01:56:58,150 --> 01:57:02,138
beneficial for a lot of conditions or

2734
01:57:00,070 --> 01:57:04,150
finding out more and more and then for

2735
01:57:02,139 --> 01:57:06,190
certain people it can really aggravate

2736
01:57:04,150 --> 01:57:08,409
certain underlying predispositions and

2737
01:57:06,190 --> 01:57:11,199
it's something as we move forward with

2738
01:57:08,409 --> 01:57:13,179
legalization and having this you know be

2739
01:57:11,199 --> 01:57:14,888
more widespread and available something

2740
01:57:13,179 --> 01:57:16,989
to really consider to have some subtlety

2741
01:57:14,889 --> 01:57:21,789
to the conversation I think it benefits

2742
01:57:16,989 --> 01:57:23,280
both sides you know so comt this is the

2743
01:57:21,789 --> 01:57:26,739
last year I'm going to talk about here

2744
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:28,869
the GG variant this is heavily heavily

2745
01:57:26,739 --> 01:57:31,209
related to memory and cannabis so I

2746
01:57:28,869 --> 01:57:33,369
don't know about you but you know

2747
01:57:31,210 --> 01:57:39,099
sometimes if I smoke I have I can't find

2748
01:57:33,369 --> 01:57:40,989
my keys and it's problem but this gene

2749
01:57:39,099 --> 01:57:43,900
is actually involved in in breaking down

2750
01:57:40,989 --> 01:57:46,839
dopamine in the brain and the GG

2751
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:49,598
variants showed a 40 percent reduction

2752
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:52,570
in working memory after consuming

2753
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:54,729
cannabis whereas the a a variance of

2754
01:57:52,570 --> 01:57:59,679
this showed almost no impaired memory

2755
01:57:54,729 --> 01:58:02,130
very little so why why am I talking

2756
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:07,050
about all these genes well and here's a

2757
01:58:02,130 --> 01:58:10,179
here's a graph from from that study well

2758
01:58:07,050 --> 01:58:13,210
so just based on that I think we

2759
01:58:10,179 --> 01:58:14,949
conclude can conclude that the you know

2760
01:58:13,210 --> 01:58:17,079
the human response to cannabis is pretty

2761
01:58:14,949 --> 01:58:19,388
varied and it's at least partially

2762
01:58:17,079 --> 01:58:25,299
attributed to genetics and these sort of

2763
01:58:19,389 --> 01:58:28,739
underlying metabolic factors so you know

2764
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:28,739
based on on that

2765
01:58:29,830 --> 01:58:34,430
where do we go from here well like I

2766
01:58:32,780 --> 01:58:36,620
said before the research on cannabis is

2767
01:58:34,430 --> 01:58:38,180
super stunted you know comparatively to

2768
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:41,660
other substances there's not a lot out

2769
01:58:38,180 --> 01:58:43,430
there so THC is one of a hundred and

2770
01:58:41,660 --> 01:58:45,889
thirty different cannabinoids in the

2771
01:58:43,430 --> 01:58:47,570
plant we pretty we only have genetically

2772
01:58:45,890 --> 01:58:50,060
stratified Studies on that one

2773
01:58:47,570 --> 01:58:52,309
cannabinoid and we know that for example

2774
01:58:50,060 --> 01:58:54,320
CBD which is another cannabinoid and

2775
01:58:52,310 --> 01:58:56,300
there's several is there's four or five

2776
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:58,429
that are being studied pretty well right

2777
01:58:56,300 --> 01:59:01,190
now but none of them have any

2778
01:58:58,430 --> 01:59:03,890
genetically informed studies so you know

2779
01:59:01,190 --> 01:59:06,440
it and and this type of genetic studies

2780
01:59:03,890 --> 01:59:09,890
happen once there's a base of research

2781
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:11,919
to be able to work from so personally

2782
01:59:09,890 --> 01:59:15,710
I'm very excited to see where this goes

2783
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:17,510
and you know the next step beyond that

2784
01:59:15,710 --> 01:59:19,880
is well how do we create strains and

2785
01:59:17,510 --> 01:59:23,780
extracts and products with precisely

2786
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:27,140
engineered profiles for people's

2787
01:59:23,780 --> 01:59:29,750
specific genetic you know people's

2788
01:59:27,140 --> 01:59:31,790
specific metabolism because we can kind

2789
01:59:29,750 --> 01:59:34,610
of reverse-engineer some of those

2790
01:59:31,790 --> 01:59:37,790
pathways and say hey you know maybe we

2791
01:59:34,610 --> 01:59:40,429
need to add in this specific substance

2792
01:59:37,790 --> 01:59:42,019
to offset that predisposition towards

2793
01:59:40,430 --> 01:59:45,170
having that memory loss when you smoke

2794
01:59:42,020 --> 01:59:47,870
and there's actually some substances in

2795
01:59:45,170 --> 01:59:49,880
cannabis terpenes there's a specific

2796
01:59:47,870 --> 01:59:51,590
terpene which goes into creating the

2797
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:54,350
flavor and smell that you get out of it

2798
01:59:51,590 --> 01:59:57,830
that's known to kind of inhibit some of

2799
01:59:54,350 --> 01:59:59,890
those memory effects so you know looking

2800
01:59:57,830 --> 02:00:02,630
at this data and being able to

2801
01:59:59,890 --> 02:00:05,600
understand someone's individual you know

2802
02:00:02,630 --> 02:00:07,010
needs can we you know design specific

2803
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:14,420
strains that might match up with

2804
02:00:07,010 --> 02:00:18,230
someone's you know predispositions and

2805
02:00:14,420 --> 02:00:19,820
beyond cannabis you know cannabis is a

2806
02:00:18,230 --> 02:00:21,650
good just general example because it's

2807
02:00:19,820 --> 02:00:23,330
really easy to see how different you

2808
02:00:21,650 --> 02:00:26,030
know your responses for mine and

2809
02:00:23,330 --> 02:00:27,880
vice-versa but I think we can

2810
02:00:26,030 --> 02:00:30,950
extrapolate this and really talk about

2811
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:32,600
psychoactives as a whole and they're

2812
02:00:30,950 --> 02:00:35,210
already starting genetic testing with

2813
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:36,590
SSRIs and you know it's pretty

2814
02:00:35,210 --> 02:00:39,320
well-established that some people have

2815
02:00:36,590 --> 02:00:41,180
very very poor response to these

2816
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:43,120
antidepressants and things like that

2817
02:00:41,180 --> 02:00:44,860
well they're already doing screenings

2818
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:47,680
now to be able to say well we know that

2819
02:00:44,860 --> 02:00:50,410
you know this genetic variable had is

2820
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:52,450
likely to have a you know suicidal

2821
02:00:50,410 --> 02:00:57,970
response so let's not give them an SSRI

2822
02:00:52,450 --> 02:01:00,940
right and I think that we can apply that

2823
02:00:57,970 --> 02:01:02,950
same logic to any type of other

2824
02:01:00,940 --> 02:01:07,419
psychoactive substances LSD DMT

2825
02:01:02,950 --> 02:01:09,370
psilocybin MDMA yeah and actually MDMA

2826
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:10,600
has a few good genetic studies looking

2827
02:01:09,370 --> 02:01:13,870
at the breakdown of it which is

2828
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:15,970
three-meat and we still don't even know

2829
02:01:13,870 --> 02:01:18,430
how LSD is fully metabolized in the body

2830
02:01:15,970 --> 02:01:21,370
so until that happens well we're not

2831
02:01:18,430 --> 02:01:23,350
gonna get the genetic studies but you

2832
02:01:21,370 --> 02:01:25,300
know I think that the future is very

2833
02:01:23,350 --> 02:01:27,520
bright for being able to do that and

2834
02:01:25,300 --> 02:01:29,110
another thing that we that are not you

2835
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:30,760
know has not been researched is what are

2836
02:01:29,110 --> 02:01:34,120
the epigenetic effects of these

2837
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:36,280
substances what are the changes to

2838
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:40,059
genetic expression personally I have a

2839
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:42,639
feeling that we're gonna see some really

2840
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:44,380
interesting results when that comes up

2841
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:46,870
because there's so many anomalous

2842
02:01:44,380 --> 02:01:48,430
reports of spontaneous healings and and

2843
02:01:46,870 --> 02:01:51,580
you know all kinds of things from

2844
02:01:48,430 --> 02:01:55,090
shamanic ceremonies all across the world

2845
02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:56,860
well I mean that just you know the light

2846
02:01:55,090 --> 02:01:58,960
goes off in my brain that says well

2847
02:01:56,860 --> 02:02:02,170
there's epigenetic effects happening

2848
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:05,670
rapidly be able to shift genetic

2849
02:02:02,170 --> 02:02:08,320
expression so what's the future here

2850
02:02:05,670 --> 02:02:10,650
maybe personalized psychedelic cocktails

2851
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:14,080
that match with individual metabolism

2852
02:02:10,650 --> 02:02:16,860
can we engineer stacks that are designed

2853
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:19,840
to match up with your metabolism your

2854
02:02:16,860 --> 02:02:23,740
individual metabolic nature actually I

2855
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:26,110
have a interesting story I had a client

2856
02:02:23,740 --> 02:02:28,740
come in maybe about two weeks ago and

2857
02:02:26,110 --> 02:02:31,179
she told me that she did ayahuasca

2858
02:02:28,740 --> 02:02:34,570
except she didn't she went to the

2859
02:02:31,180 --> 02:02:36,040
ceremony drank it everyone else you know

2860
02:02:34,570 --> 02:02:37,420
it happened everyone else nothing

2861
02:02:36,040 --> 02:02:39,269
happened to her and she said that was

2862
02:02:37,420 --> 02:02:41,470
the second time but that happened and

2863
02:02:39,270 --> 02:02:42,730
she was attributing it to all maybe the

2864
02:02:41,470 --> 02:02:45,730
plant spirit just doesn't want to work

2865
02:02:42,730 --> 02:02:52,059
with me and you know something like that

2866
02:02:45,730 --> 02:02:55,629
and I I went and looked up her herd Mao

2867
02:02:52,060 --> 02:02:57,489
genes and Mao breaks down DMT the active

2868
02:02:55,630 --> 02:03:00,280
ingredient in

2869
02:02:57,489 --> 02:03:03,159
in ayahuasca and it turned out that she

2870
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:05,440
had six out of the eight genetic

2871
02:03:03,159 --> 02:03:11,320
variables that code for higher levels of

2872
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:13,928
Mao so on a you know very kind of basic

2873
02:03:11,320 --> 02:03:16,539
level she just was breaking down the DMT

2874
02:03:13,929 --> 02:03:20,289
before it had a chance to work and while

2875
02:03:16,539 --> 02:03:21,999
the natural MAO inhibitor in the

2876
02:03:20,289 --> 02:03:23,920
substance was working for everyone else

2877
02:03:21,999 --> 02:03:26,829
but not it just there wasn't enough of

2878
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:28,719
it for her so you know instead of

2879
02:03:26,829 --> 02:03:30,730
attributing it to something to the plant

2880
02:03:28,719 --> 02:03:34,749
spirit maybe we could you know look at

2881
02:03:30,730 --> 02:03:38,489
the the biomechanics of it and I'm sure

2882
02:03:34,749 --> 02:03:41,610
the plant spirit is involved as well but

2883
02:03:38,489 --> 02:03:50,110
like to look at it from both angles I

2884
02:03:41,610 --> 02:03:55,030
can't actually see that okay so yeah you

2885
02:03:50,110 --> 02:03:56,980
know what are the quickly you know what

2886
02:03:55,030 --> 02:03:58,480
are the questions to ask if you know

2887
02:03:56,980 --> 02:04:01,480
people doing research on this kind of

2888
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:04,388
thing talk to them about this spread

2889
02:04:01,480 --> 02:04:07,539
this information you know what are the

2890
02:04:04,389 --> 02:04:09,639
pathways that that influence the way you

2891
02:04:07,539 --> 02:04:11,949
respond to these things and I don't know

2892
02:04:09,639 --> 02:04:14,769
I'm I'm personally very very excited to

2893
02:04:11,949 --> 02:04:17,518
see where this goes a lot of it is going

2894
02:04:14,769 --> 02:04:19,420
to be underground grassroots

2895
02:04:17,519 --> 02:04:22,630
experimentation obviously for a long

2896
02:04:19,420 --> 02:04:24,579
hopefully not a long time but I

2897
02:04:22,630 --> 02:04:28,599
encourage you to if you have your

2898
02:04:24,579 --> 02:04:30,219
23andme data you know and you have an

2899
02:04:28,599 --> 02:04:32,230
interest in this kind of thing compare

2900
02:04:30,219 --> 02:04:34,150
your notes with people and let's start

2901
02:04:32,230 --> 02:04:36,968
to get a community conversation going

2902
02:04:34,150 --> 02:04:45,579
about this type of thing so any

2903
02:04:36,969 --> 02:04:49,840
questions just just curious the the

2904
02:04:45,579 --> 02:04:55,210
different genetic sequences or variation

2905
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:58,119
as you mentioned in this it depends on

2906
02:04:55,210 --> 02:05:01,150
which one so the COMT variable the

2907
02:04:58,119 --> 02:05:04,690
memory lost one about 25% of the

2908
02:05:01,150 --> 02:05:06,400
population has the the extreme versions

2909
02:05:04,690 --> 02:05:07,719
of it and then there's about 50% of the

2910
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:09,839
population that's like right in the

2911
02:05:07,719 --> 02:05:12,599
middle

2912
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:15,409
the the other ones very I think the the

2913
02:05:12,599 --> 02:05:18,590
slow metabolizer of THC that that gene

2914
02:05:15,409 --> 02:05:22,230
is about 20% of the population and also

2915
02:05:18,590 --> 02:05:25,739
is dependent on ethnic groups and what

2916
02:05:22,230 --> 02:05:27,079
part of the world you're from no none of

2917
02:05:25,739 --> 02:05:31,369
those that I talked about are room

2918
02:05:27,079 --> 02:05:33,650
any thoughts our experience of genetic

2919
02:05:31,369 --> 02:05:36,808
influence regarding the tropics and

2920
02:05:33,650 --> 02:05:41,879
nootropics yeah that's personally I

2921
02:05:36,809 --> 02:05:43,650
don't know a lot about about you know

2922
02:05:41,880 --> 02:05:46,800
what those variables would be but I'm

2923
02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:49,860
sure there's a ton of good good research

2924
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:51,119
out there I encourage you to look look

2925
02:05:49,860 --> 02:05:52,440
into it and if you want to email me

2926
02:05:51,119 --> 02:05:55,920
