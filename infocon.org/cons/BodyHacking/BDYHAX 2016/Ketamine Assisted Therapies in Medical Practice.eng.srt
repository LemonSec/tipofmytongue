1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:10,900
so I am I'm happy to welcome back to the

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,760
stage dr. Paul Abramson

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,620
he is a doctor with an active private

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,230
practice in San Fermin San Francisco

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:19,960
where he spoke to us about that practice

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,699
yesterday where his patients were using

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,170
self tracking for health and greater

8
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:25,240
awareness for many years

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:27,279
his practice has always been really

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,009
innovative in bringing in new tech and

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,470
ideas and building an integrated

12
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,960
practice around patient care often ideas

13
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:39,160
that are really unconventional or older

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,170
ideas and he's actually going to talk to

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,940
us today about ketamine being

16
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,559
rediscovered as a medicine to augment

17
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,739
therapies especially for

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,390
treatment-resistant disorders he'll

19
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:51,010
discuss the early results from his

20
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,079
team's use of ketamine assisted

21
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,780
psychotherapy for severe depression OCD

22
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:59,199
and PTSD and ketamine assisted treatment

23
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:01,149
of chronic pain and he'll also give us a

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,339
little insight into the re-emergence of

25
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:05,019
psychedelics in American medical

26
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,880
practice as it's being researched by

27
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,250
educational institutions and the

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,289
military anyway I really like you guys

29
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:17,590
to welcome to the stage back to the

30
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:19,450
stage dr. Paul Abramson thanks Pam hi

31
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,850
I'm Paul Abramson I'm a medical doctor

32
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,040
and a former engineer in San Francisco

33
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,390
and I'm going to expand on the topic

34
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,580
that I mentioned yesterday when I was

35
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,710
talking about self tracking which is the

36
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:34,929
concept concept of patients who get into

37
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:37,210
really stuck places where even our crazy

38
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,890
and complex techniques can't get them

39
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,939
out of that stuck place it could be a

40
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:45,460
situation a point of view a diagnosis

41
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,710
and that's going to segue into ketamine

42
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,089
which is a dissociative and psychedelic

43
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,279
drug that's actually been used in

44
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:55,270
American medical practice for decades as

45
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,520
an anesthetic agent mostly in ER and ICU

46
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,740
settings but it's now getting another

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,630
look from the scientific community in

48
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,158
the medical community for use in really

49
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,119
treatment resistant psychiatric

50
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:09,360
conditions like depression and OCD and

51
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,470
also in the chronic pain world mostly

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,360
anesthesiologists so we've been

53
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,120
exploring this newly empowered by all

54
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,670
this new research and clinical findings

55
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,760
and it finally got to the point where

56
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,410
we thought might we could introduce it

57
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,120
into a private medical practice and see

58
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,750
how it works with actual people outside

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,850
of a study this also leads into a

60
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,400
broader look at the use of consciousness

61
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,920
expanding drugs like psychedelics in

62
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,570
medical practice and why would you want

63
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,459
to do that well sometimes when people

64
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:42,820
are stuck you need to kind of loosen the

65
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,500
screws or lubricate the brain machinery

66
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,290
in a way that maybe people could move in

67
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,330
different ways both psychologically and

68
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,890
physically so I'm going to give you some

69
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,420
context about the environment in our

70
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,209
practice that I've created where we're

71
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,850
doing ketamine assisted treatments also

72
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:59,260
talked about ketamine and actually give

73
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,690
you a few case studies of people we've

74
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,600
actually treated in the six months that

75
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,980
we've been we've been doing this so then

76
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,049
I'm going to also put it in the general

77
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,179
context of how we work with patients and

78
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,460
our concept of n of one studies and

79
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,770
really empowering people to figure out

80
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:19,450
for themselves what is going to work for

81
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:22,690
them so my grandfather great-grandfather

82
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:26,649
were both physicians and surgeons in the

83
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:28,750
early and mid 1900s they exemplified

84
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:32,530
this physician who didn't have a lot of

85
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,900
technological tools they had surgery and

86
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:39,630
they had limited amounts of knowledge

87
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:41,440
about microbiology and late in my

88
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,620
grandfather's career there were

89
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,430
antibiotics but really they were often

90
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,989
dealing with people who were in pretty

91
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,700
untenable conditions that were going to

92
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,160
result in a loss of function or a loss

93
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,049
of life and really sitting with them in

94
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,600
providing psychological and spiritual

95
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:01,330
support as part of their job it was just

96
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:04,299
really expected and I think I hear some

97
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:08,560
illustrations up on the slide of the use

98
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,910
of ether in a surgical environment and

99
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,660
they used to do surgery in front of an

100
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:16,329
audience and ether was actually pretty

101
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,250
barbaric by today's anesthesia standards

102
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:20,649
but it was a really great advance over

103
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:27,130
bourbon and a strap a leather to bite on

104
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:28,780
so I turned out that even though they

105
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,150
didn't have a lot of tools they had very

106
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:34,919
very very satisfying careers

107
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:37,419
as healers and hands-on healers so that

108
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,490
segues into our current medical practice

109
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:42,430
in San Francisco I actually worked in

110
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,990
the ER and ICU for years and finally

111
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,150
sort of got fed up with the assembly

112
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,490
line of medical care and started my own

113
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,859
private practice because I saw from my

114
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,690
engineering background and my other

115
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,240
adventures that there was probably a

116
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,580
better way to do medical practice so I

117
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,900
started solo just one doctor in a

118
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,320
medical practice and figured out that

119
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:05,289
this is way too complex to do alone so

120
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,409
I've now gotten a team of different

121
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:10,030
kinds of practitioners who work together

122
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,260
to provide general medical care and now

123
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,809
that we have psychologists and

124
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,340
therapists and other other kinds of

125
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,830
practitioners we can now start to take

126
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,659
on some of the less tangible parts of

127
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:22,840
medical practice around psychology and

128
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:25,540
behavior and we have an addiction

129
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,099
medicine for professionals who are

130
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,430
addicted to things components of other

131
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,900
practice we've returned to something I

132
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,070
actually learned in residency but I now

133
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,830
appreciate a lot better called

134
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,210
behavioral medicine it sort of takes

135
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:45,729
psychiatry out of the picture and it

136
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:49,270
just looks as oh I seem to have lost my

137
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:50,350
slides but it takes psychiatry out of

138
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,419
the picture and it just looks at people

139
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,180
as whole entities whether it's medical

140
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:59,050
or psychiatric or spiritual and tries to

141
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:03,730
put this context of how to supervise

142
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:07,420
them in a medical context and ok here we

143
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:08,950
are and treat them as whole people so

144
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,530
now we have a doctor a physician

145
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,340
assistant a nurse practitioner a

146
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,229
psychologist two masters level

147
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,619
therapists a dietitian and a Chinese

148
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:19,270
medicine doctor and by the way we are

149
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,070
recruiting and looking for another

150
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,840
medical doctor to join us so if you know

151
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:26,080
anyone who might want to do that please

152
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,599
send it my way so now instead of

153
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,430
actually in Northern California and

154
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,170
emergency medicine they actually

155
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,670
evaluate emergency medicine physicians

156
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,490
on how fast they they actually call it

157
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:38,260
moving the meet in an ER how fast you

158
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,180
can move people through and instead of

159
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:43,760
doing that we're not taking each person

160
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:46,040
and following them and I find everything

161
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,909
we can to individualize and optimize the

162
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:52,600
treatment of each individual person so

163
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:56,480
the old system I used to work in

164
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,860
involves a physician and a patient but

165
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,300
the patient also had all these other

166
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,310
people they were working with none of

167
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,450
whom communicated with each other and so

168
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,540
this is something that's really broken

169
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:07,880
about our current medical system and the

170
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:11,120
role of the primary doctor has really

171
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:14,450
become to refer people to a disconnected

172
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,980
array of specialists and in practice

173
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,810
that could work if everyone could

174
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,160
communicate but I found even in academic

175
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,350
centers where everybody works for the

176
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,940
same organization it's really hard for

177
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,860
everyone to communicate and the culture

178
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,490
of medicine doesn't really encourage

179
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:31,670
that so the model we've constructed

180
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,800
really puts the patient and the

181
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,390
physician and the therapist and their

182
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,160
team in our practice at the center

183
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,719
inside this wall where everybody

184
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,100
communicates and then we help them to

185
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,560
interface with the outside world and

186
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:45,500
this relates to the ketamine therapy

187
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,230
because this little circle around our

188
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,970
team provides a kind of containment and

189
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,080
a sense that we're going to find out

190
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,030
what's going on and we're going to be

191
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,650
able to help adjust things if they're

192
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,840
not working out and that has really

193
00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:00,169
empowered us to go out a little bit on

194
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,580
the edge of some ways of working with

195
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,170
people that involve a little bit more

196
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,240
risk but have potentially a lot more

197
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:09,560
return because we have a container built

198
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:12,410
around it so I'd like to define

199
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,810
stuckness it's a it's a word it actually

200
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:18,320
is a word in Webster's I think says it's

201
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:20,270
to be unable to move or be moved or to

202
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:24,349
accept or to tolerate an unpleasant

203
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:26,599
situation and I think in any way anyone

204
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,640
who works with people finds people who

205
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,410
are stuck and maybe you know ever

206
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,479
probably everybody experiences being

207
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,860
stuck at one time or another and it's

208
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,990
one of these frustrating things where

209
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,419
the harder you try sometimes the less

210
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:42,260
successful you get at getting people

211
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:46,699
unstuck so in medical care what gets

212
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:48,380
stuck the examples I'm going to choose

213
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,210
are from the literature that's now

214
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,550
exists around ketamine there are many

215
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,190
many many additional things but

216
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,469
depression trauma and stress and

217
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:00,170
post-traumatic stress disorder

218
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,340
obsessive-compulsive disorder involving

219
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:05,640
obsessive thinking and compulsive

220
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:08,190
actions and also the response to chronic

221
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,949
pain which is often a long-term

222
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,710
situation that sets up a dynamic with

223
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:17,520
the brain and the body and the psyche

224
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:20,760
that can get really stuck so our

225
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,650
approach before ketamine entered the

226
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,689
picture was just really a thorough

227
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,760
medical approach where we have rapport

228
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,860
with the patient we have a container we

229
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,450
have a team or pretty creative we do

230
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:35,670
these edible and experiments with people

231
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:37,230
and that's fine except often we

232
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,689
encounter people who come to us having

233
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,720
already done that for ten years and now

234
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,460
they've reached a crisis or a crisis

235
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,510
comes up in their life around whatever

236
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,150
they're stuck with and there really

237
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,319
isn't time to iterate on animal

238
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,290
experiments for months or years

239
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,390
sometimes we need answers now

240
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:58,230
or it's the patient who's suddenly and

241
00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:00,120
severely suicidal so we were really

242
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,880
looking for new tools and creative new

243
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,000
options to help people who got stuck in

244
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,510
a way that needed action right away so

245
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,160
I'd like to take a little detour I have

246
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,780
a long standing and standing academic

247
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,000
interest in psychedelic assisted

248
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:19,860
therapies they were mostly studied

249
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,140
before I was born in the 50s and 60s and

250
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,120
that research was incredibly promising

251
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,350
and there were thousands and thousands

252
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,660
and thousands of journal articles

253
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:30,240
published on psychedelic assisted

254
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,819
therapy and all sorts of things until

255
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,620
the mid 60s when the DEA rescheduled all

256
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,740
of the psychedelics to schedule one

257
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,950
meeting no medical use and then I was

258
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,620
born and you know later I thought maybe

259
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:46,080
I was born a couple decades too late but

260
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,030
in the last I would say five to eight

261
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,310
years psychedelics have started to come

262
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,839
back into research and now all of the

263
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,750
major medical centers and academic

264
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,520
centers in the US and in Britain and and

265
00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:00,140
Israel and other countries are now

266
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:03,180
studying in an fda-approved fashion

267
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,699
psilocybin LSD and other psychedelics

268
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,890
for use in medical and psychiatric

269
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:10,230
conditions so that's pretty exciting and

270
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,160
it's really hit the press with Michael

271
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,720
Pollan put out this art

272
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,079
called a trip treatment in a New Yorker

273
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,240
last year and then it started to really

274
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:19,649
snowball so now it's pretty much every

275
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,279
week there's some new article on

276
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:26,430
psychedelics and medicine and because

277
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,949
the FDA and DEA sponsored research has

278
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,689
so many strings attached the catch of

279
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:32,699
all this is it's going to be five to ten

280
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:34,949
years before there's anything that's

281
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:36,750
available outside of a study and the

282
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:39,449
studies are pretty we are pretty limited

283
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:44,970
because it's incredibly expensive to do

284
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:47,519
FDA sponsored research so nonetheless

285
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,829
I'd like to just plug someone I'm not a

286
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,050
group that I'm not affiliated with but

287
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:54,839
at NYU they're doing a study of people

288
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,699
mostly psychedelically naive people with

289
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,310
end-stage cancer who are suffering from

290
00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:00,959
severe anxiety and they they were able

291
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:03,029
to recruit lots of people for this

292
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,930
amazingly where they gave them high-dose

293
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:09,569
psilocybin in a setting of ongoing

294
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:11,310
psychotherapy and support and the

295
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:13,259
results are truly phenomenal they have a

296
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,180
documentary that it might be out already

297
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:17,069
or it's going to come out soon it has

298
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,170
interviews of these patients and I

299
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:21,329
recommend everybody find that and look

300
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,189
at it when it comes out because these

301
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:26,250
are these are middle-aged people young

302
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:29,339
people old people who were crippled with

303
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:32,100
anxiety and after one session of

304
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:35,790
psilocybin had complete revolutions in

305
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:38,459
their life and were able to really feel

306
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:40,709
both relief of suffering and a new

307
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:42,149
excitement about making the most of

308
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:44,969
every moment they had so it's a really

309
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:46,680
inspiring bit of research and that's

310
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,240
just that's just the tip of the iceberg

311
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,829
there's so much stuff going on which is

312
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,550
very exciting but it's really not coming

313
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:56,729
to any local treatment paradigm anytime

314
00:12:53,550 --> 00:13:00,329
soon because of the regulatory stuff so

315
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:02,189
I'd like to switch to ketamine as it

316
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:04,138
turns out all consciousness expanding

317
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:06,779
drugs in the United States are currently

318
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:08,759
scheduled one and illegal for use

319
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:10,829
outside of a study except for one and

320
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:14,730
that's ketamine it's actually Schedule

321
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:16,758
three which is the same as like tylenol

322
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:19,759
with codeine so it's actually pretty

323
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:22,529
pretty lightly scheduled in the u.s.

324
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:25,650
it's FDA approved for use in anesthesia

325
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:29,280
and conscious sedation where

326
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:30,750
in the ER ICU and it's actually on the

327
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,939
World Health Organization's

328
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,800
essential drug list for developing

329
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,300
countries because unlike the other

330
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,030
anesthetic agents it doesn't make you

331
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:41,280
stop breathing and it doesn't drop your

332
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:42,990
blood pressure and it doesn't have a lot

333
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,209
of the risks that require ICU and

334
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,800
anesthesia monitoring so they actually

335
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:49,620
use it in Africa and other developing

336
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,560
countries to do anesthesia on humans and

337
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,360
it's also the most widely used

338
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:59,030
anesthetic used in veterinary practice

339
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:02,670
ketamine orin orin analogues ketamine so

340
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:04,110
I sometimes wonder all the thousands and

341
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,150
thousands I have a lot of veterinarian

342
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,130
friends all the thousands of animals

343
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:11,030
that they've companion animals they've

344
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:13,290
anesthetized in the last year basically

345
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:15,990
what is the effect on these cats and

346
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:19,380
dogs and being given moderate to high

347
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:20,760
dose ketamine but and and actually it

348
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:24,170
will touch on this later but this is

349
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:26,760
also the source of a lot of recreational

350
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:31,069
use of ketamine is from a veterinary

351
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:33,600
source repurposed so in human medicine

352
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:36,810
in my time in the in the ER I gave

353
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,910
dozens of children ketamine when sewing

354
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:41,310
up a laceration on the face if you have

355
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:44,510
a young kid who's really feisty it's a

356
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:46,829
great drug for that it's very very safe

357
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:48,360
however it has an interesting side

358
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,010
effect and then it makes the child leave

359
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,890
their body in their eyes become a hit

360
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:55,290
and often that causes a side effect and

361
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:59,580
a mother or father who's like where's my

362
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:01,319
baby and and it's it's really dramatic

363
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:03,480
and if you don't counsel them ahead of

364
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,100
time they think their child is never

365
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,950
coming back but they always do come back

366
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,010
on in humans it's not used nearly as

367
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:12,690
much because of this effect and because

368
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:14,069
unlike children when when adults come

369
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:16,560
back they frequently have what they call

370
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:18,870
an emergency action which is essentially

371
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,689
re-entering of the body and a conscious

372
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:24,180
awareness of having been in this

373
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,470
dissociated psychedelic state and in a

374
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,689
medical setting with lots of bright

375
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,970
lights and no counseling this is pretty

376
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,860
frightening to adult so when we use it

377
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:34,350
with adults the standard practices to

378
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,520
get also give them valium or versed or

379
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,030
some sedatives so that they don't

380
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,040
remember the experience

381
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:41,810
but it turns out that this transpersonal

382
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,480
out-of-body experience that's been given

383
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,890
to people in the US and I bet in this

384
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,870
room is probably at least a couple of

385
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,670
people who had ketamine as a child in

386
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:54,080
the ER and then probably don't remember

387
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:55,339
it but it's some of these side effects

388
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,250
are actually potentially really

389
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:02,420
therapeutic effects that have not been

390
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:05,900
leveraged at all until recently so this

391
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:10,459
is a cartography of psychoactive drugs

392
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:11,900
and it's not really important to look

393
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,960
into details but ketamine falls

394
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,240
somewhere between the psychedelics and

395
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:21,080
the hallucinogens and the depressants

396
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:24,530
and the dissociatives and they're

397
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,210
probably the most closest agent in terms

398
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:29,750
of the dissociative effects is nitrous

399
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:32,780
oxide but ketamine does a lot more than

400
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:34,730
nitrous oxide so this is also not that

401
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,350
important in its detail but this is the

402
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,690
sort of current state of the art on what

403
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,540
ketamine does inside nerve cells in the

404
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:44,360
brain and it's seen it affects many many

405
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:46,219
many different processes it seems to

406
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,230
increase glutamate which is one of the

407
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,490
neurotransmitters it also increases a

408
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:53,300
chemical called brain derived

409
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:55,160
neurotrophic factor and it also hits

410
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:58,640
opiate receptors so it reduces pain

411
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,530
while inducing a dissociative state but

412
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,120
the science is really new and being

413
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:04,399
worked out and now that it's being

414
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,839
studied for depression pharmaceutical

415
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,209
industry has a lot more interest in this

416
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,060
in this old drug so what we'll know more

417
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:12,920
soon but and if I'm going to talk about

418
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,730
neurobiology I have to show a functional

419
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,050
MRI this is just the time course of

420
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,120
ketamine's effects on different brain

421
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,290
centers starting in that little spot in

422
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,179
the front of the brain which is the

423
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:27,139
ocular frontal cortex so it induces

424
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:30,320
visual changes very early in the in the

425
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,850
course of its effects so the one thing

426
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,540
that's kind of interesting is that it's

427
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:36,949
this buzzword called neuroplasticity

428
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,899
which is either making new synaptic

429
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,060
connections or changing synaptic

430
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,040
connections in the brain that might lead

431
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,720
you to be able to rewire yourself and

432
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,050
potentially change things that are stuck

433
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,280
so at least if you're a rat in this

434
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,960
study

435
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,000
seems to induce very rapid

436
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,330
neuroplasticity in areas of the brain

437
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,100
involved with addiction and there's a

438
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:01,820
lot of work being done on this but this

439
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:05,179
is in the last year so this is another

440
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:07,280
complicated diagram which is actually

441
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:10,490
the subjective experience of human

442
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,800
studies or of human subjects on either

443
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:16,220
psilocybin the active ingredient in

444
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,370
magic mushrooms or ketamine and if

445
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,540
you're looking at perceptual changes

446
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:23,360
insightfulness mystical mystical

447
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:25,220
experience cognitive changes Academy

448
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,340
there's a lot of similarities to

449
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,290
psilocybin and so exciting is being

450
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,879
studied at Johns Hopkins NYU and many

451
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:34,129
other places it's very exciting but it's

452
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,680
not here yet whereas ketamine is is here

453
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,150
today and the interesting other thing is

454
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,910
this is not apples and oranges this is a

455
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:44,030
very high dose of psilocybin equivalent

456
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,950
to four grams as silicide cubensis and

457
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:48,520
only a half milligram per kilogram of

458
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:50,690
IBK t'me which is a very low dose so

459
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:54,050
ketamine is probably even more like

460
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:57,290
psilocybin than we would otherwise know

461
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:59,090
so this is just another neuroanatomy

462
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:01,159
comparison showing that even though they

463
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,810
act on different parts of the brain the

464
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,570
downstream effects of those psilocybin

465
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:08,000
and ketamine are very similar they both

466
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,320
can do soluta mate release and BDNF

467
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,070
brain-derived neurotrophic factor

468
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,899
release so and they also light up

469
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:18,830
similar parts of the brain on a

470
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:21,710
functional MRI so now I'd like to switch

471
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:24,770
gears again and get into the dark side

472
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:26,180
of ketamine I bet there are people who

473
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:30,100
have tried ketamine recreationally in

474
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:32,330
the room or who know people who have and

475
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:35,629
even though ketamine has all this

476
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:38,689
wonderful potential kids at maze seem to

477
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:41,090
love it and it's really the only

478
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:43,820
psychedelic in my opinion that has true

479
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:45,860
addictive potential so there's a lot of

480
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:49,669
stigma around ketamine use in

481
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:52,040
psychedelic research circles because a

482
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:54,110
lot of these neuroscientists who have

483
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,240
been experimenting on themselves with

484
00:19:54,110 --> 00:20:00,290
psychedelics have seen themselves or

485
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,840
others taken down by ketamine and so we

486
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:05,409
take this incredibly seriously

487
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:08,330
and in the practice we actually treat

488
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:10,220
ketamine addiction in addition to using

489
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,629
ketamine for therapeutic benefit so we

490
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,220
actually have first-hand knowledge of

491
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,830
people who have gone down the rabbit

492
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,840
hole with with recreational ketamine and

493
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,720
we strongly advise people not to do this

494
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,550
at home

495
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,590
because when in a non supervised

496
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,200
recreational context a certain fraction

497
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,120
of people will really have bad outcomes

498
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:32,230
it can involve toxicity to the bladder

499
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,580
paranoia psychosis and other really

500
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:37,160
things that sometimes don't reverse when

501
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,530
you stop doing the académie so luckily

502
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:42,020
there's a substantial body of evidence

503
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:45,230
now that medically supervised ketamine

504
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:47,180
in selected patients who are doing this

505
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:50,000
for therapeutic reasons does not seem to

506
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:53,180
really induce addiction so and we've

507
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,950
pretty much seen we've been concerned

508
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,420
about certain people where they have an

509
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:58,190
addiction history and we're using it for

510
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,380
other things but we really haven't seen

511
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:05,540
any problems and that's borne out in the

512
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:08,690
fair amount of literature so just two

513
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,700
examples from the popular culture the

514
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,620
first is john lily and the second second

515
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:16,580
is dr. house these are two physicians

516
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:19,060
who got into ketamine actually trying to

517
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:21,100
fix themselves and that's a part of the

518
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:24,169
fantasy world that ketamine

519
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:26,209
recreationally can induce is this sense

520
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:28,700
that it will let you fix thorny parts of

521
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:31,660
yourself and then people get wrapped up

522
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,830
in that and can't stop so both of them

523
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,930
even though they felt like they were in

524
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:38,449
control in the end it looked pretty bad

525
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:41,870
from the outside and that's a common

526
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:43,040
endpoint with ketamine addiction so I'd

527
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,659
like to talk about ketamine and

528
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,370
treatment resistant depression that's

529
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,330
the one that's gotten the most press in

530
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:52,040
the scientific and popular literature

531
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:55,610
but first of all I need to say ketamine

532
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:57,320
is fda-approved for anesthesia so how is

533
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,790
it that physicians are now using it for

534
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,240
depression there's this thing called

535
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:05,300
off-label use once a drug is scheduled

536
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,760
somewhere 2 through 5 where it's legal

537
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,169
to prescribe for anything physicians are

538
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,660
actually free to prescribe it although

539
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:15,690
they call it off-label for other uses

540
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:17,340
and that's actually widely done probably

541
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,080
I don't know what the exact number is

542
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,730
but a pretty substantial fraction of all

543
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,259
prescribing in the u.s. is off-label

544
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,610
because once things get approved for one

545
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:25,860
thing there's no one no one's going to

546
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:30,959
pay for a study to get it approved for

547
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:32,580
other things so so on an ethical basis

548
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,200
though because we're using it using it

549
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,570
off-label we really needed to wait for

550
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,009
enough research and precedent to arrive

551
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,600
before we felt comfortable in this

552
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:43,169
private practice setting going and using

553
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,939
it so but I also had administered it to

554
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:47,009
dozens and dozens of patients in an

555
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,529
emergency setting so I had a pretty good

556
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:52,950
feel for its pros and cons and risks and

557
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:55,679
how to how to manage it so why would you

558
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:57,779
want to use ketamine for depression we

559
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,899
have all these other drugs mostly other

560
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:01,799
drugs take weeks like prozac takes weeks

561
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:04,110
to take effect

562
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:05,908
ketamine seems to have an effect and

563
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:08,850
that's just one reference of a

564
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:11,070
meta-analysis of studies it has an

565
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:13,500
effect within hours in seventy eighty

566
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:15,389
percent of people of with severe

567
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,470
depression it causes a rapid reversal of

568
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:20,879
depression that lasts a week or two so

569
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:23,190
if you have someone in a really urgent

570
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:24,750
situation or if you have someone who's

571
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:27,450
tried everything and is it isn't working

572
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:30,570
and just needs some sort of ray of hope

573
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:34,080
you can get them pretty fast relief in a

574
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:36,809
lot of cases and and that can really be

575
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,789
changing it can really inspire people to

576
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:42,178
do other things that they've been stuck

577
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:44,009
and not doing obsessive-compulsive

578
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:46,110
disorder is another very stuck condition

579
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:47,909
the mainstay of therapy right now is

580
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,189
drugs like prozac and cognitive

581
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:54,090
behavioral therapy but neither one of

582
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:55,259
those works quickly and it's really hard

583
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:59,490
to get someone who's really really

584
00:23:55,259 --> 00:24:04,019
really obsessive to do things in it in a

585
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:06,690
timely fashion so OCD can be very very

586
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:08,399
very disabling and tragic and it also

587
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:12,029
seems to have a very robust and quick

588
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:15,389
response to ketamine and post-traumatic

589
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:17,159
stress disorder is near and dear to my

590
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:19,320
heart because as I've known for years

591
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,990
it's not just about physical trauma the

592
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,360
VA is now stuck with hundreds of

593
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:26,009
thousands of veterans with PTSD from

594
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,810
physical and emotional trauma

595
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:29,710
but

596
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:32,210
it's a widely under-diagnosed thing that

597
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:35,570
psychological and emotional and other

598
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:37,130
kinds of stimuli can induce PTSD and I

599
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,950
think it has a lot of downstream effects

600
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:43,060
in our society so MDMA is currently

601
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:46,250
being studied that's ecstasy the

602
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:48,730
scientific name of ecstasy to treat PTSD

603
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:51,080
but that's also five six years away from

604
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,340
rescheduling because it's stuck in I

605
00:24:51,080 --> 00:25:00,919
think they're about to start phase three

606
00:24:52,340 --> 00:25:03,100
trials so so the container is basically

607
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,240
we do a very we're still pretty

608
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,770
conservative about how we use ketamine

609
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,390
their practice we assess people

610
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:11,600
medically and psychologically we have

611
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:13,340
them into long term therapy and we add

612
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,649
ketamine to that mix to try to get

613
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,389
things to move faster but we're not just

614
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:21,440
sort of trying to use ketamine as a and

615
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:24,710
age a drug outside of the context it

616
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,750
also frequently requires monitoring both

617
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,460
heart rate and blood pressure and oxygen

618
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,050
and sometimes we have to actually give

619
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,390
people medications to lower their blood

620
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:36,610
pressure or treat nausea and vomiting so

621
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:38,600
it's a relatively high touch kind of

622
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:41,270
experience to put two people through a

623
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,129
ketamine session it probably could be

624
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,710
done simpler but we're we're really

625
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:49,820
trying to be as careful and responsible

626
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:51,110
as we can right now so obsessive

627
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,899
compulsive disorder I'd like to talk

628
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:57,439
about a case fairly recently in the last

629
00:25:53,900 --> 00:26:01,370
month in our practice it was a 30 year

630
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:04,300
old tech worker a woman who had a long

631
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:06,580
history of severe obsessional thinking

632
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,169
procrastination internet addiction

633
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:11,750
compulsive behaviors social anxiety was

634
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:13,610
just really stuck had been through lots

635
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:15,890
of therapy had tried different kinds of

636
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:17,990
meds actually came in just for a medical

637
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:20,570
check-up because I'm this engineer

638
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:23,060
doctor and after we talked it just

639
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:26,840
really came out that that her OCD was

640
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:29,629
was the major problem actually so I had

641
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:33,050
our psychologist see her and after a

642
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,700
while we all just decided to add had

643
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:37,700
ketamine because the patient was like

644
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:39,400
you're prescribing cognitive exercises

645
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,490
this is going to take

646
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:45,520
ten weeks I can't even get out of bed to

647
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:47,080
go to work I'm checking the stove 40

648
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,460
times before I leave the house it's just

649
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,159
a real real mess

650
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:54,900
so our hope was that ketamine would

651
00:26:51,160 --> 00:27:00,790
speed things up and this is actually

652
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:03,520
data from our we're now collecting some

653
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:05,559
validated research data on each patient

654
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,030
not so much as a population study but

655
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:11,309
just so we can track what's what's

656
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:14,740
happening and so this is a Yale Brown

657
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:17,080
OCD symptoms air and she was very very

658
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,720
severe before her first treatment and

659
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,800
after the first treatment it was almost

660
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:25,540
in full remission and after the second

661
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:29,428
treatment it was even better and I think

662
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:32,320
the the patient was ecstatic and

663
00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:33,700
excusive about how much things seem

664
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,320
different but actually the most

665
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,020
actionable thing for me was my

666
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,700
psychologist face when she was talking

667
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,990
about the sessions with the patient she

668
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,360
had just never seen anything like that

669
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:46,240
before someone who was completely stuck

670
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,620
and then became completely unstuck had a

671
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,420
bucket list was planning an

672
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:52,270
around-the-world trip it was just a

673
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:58,059
really dramatic and morale-boosting for

674
00:27:52,270 --> 00:28:03,610
everyone kind of experience so and the

675
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:06,280
patient had many quotations we do we do

676
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:09,790
have them write some journaling before

677
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:12,399
and after and whereas before she was

678
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:15,190
really stuck now she was touching into

679
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,760
her heart things were giving her peace

680
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:20,860
she was feeling lighter she was letting

681
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,690
go and making big changes and she

682
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,010
actually subsequently has made many many

683
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,559
big changes that she had been putting

684
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:30,670
off for years

685
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:33,520
so case number two is sort of in the

686
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:36,070
depression and chronic pain realm this

687
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,750
is a middle-aged woman who had 30 years

688
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,820
of psychotherapy 10 years of

689
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:43,230
psychoanalysis for depression had been

690
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:46,120
to every drug had had magnetic residents

691
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:49,390
brain stimulation had had a lot of

692
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,309
different things done and was really at

693
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:55,659
the end of a rope with with the

694
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:57,399
question also had chronic pain and so we

695
00:28:55,659 --> 00:29:00,580
started out actually with a chronic pain

696
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:01,689
protocol which is long IV infusions and

697
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:05,080
then move to more of a depression

698
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:06,309
protocol and this was earlier in our use

699
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,678
of ketamine so we didn't have as much

700
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:10,658
data collection going on but what it

701
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:13,269
what really happened was was an almost

702
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:15,009
immediate relief of depression that came

703
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:16,899
BETT the depression came back after a

704
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:19,090
few weeks and we did repeated sessions

705
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:21,820
and each time it seemed to last longer

706
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:24,610
and longer so now she's pretty much done

707
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,559
she says it's been a few months and

708
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:28,178
she's not really planning anymore

709
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,619
ketamine she seems to feel better and

710
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:34,720
it's done all these other changes in

711
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:36,279
your life so she actually reported that

712
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,950
for the first time in ten years she had

713
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:42,100
three days of no pain but the pain came

714
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:44,549
back unfortunately but she said just

715
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:48,189
having had three days of no pain was so

716
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:49,690
inspiring that she decided to go back to

717
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,610
school and do something totally

718
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:53,080
different with her life because before

719
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:57,340
that she was just completely hopeless

720
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:59,168
and she likens the effect to her

721
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:02,019
experience twenty five years before when

722
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:07,090
she first tried prozac which had long

723
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:10,990
since stopped working so case number

724
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:15,129
three is a case of depression and social

725
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:17,409
anxiety and this was actually maybe the

726
00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:23,639
most depressed patient that our

727
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:26,379
psychologists and I had ever seen so she

728
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:28,229
had been through every class of

729
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:30,070
antidepressants mood stabilizer

730
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:31,809
antipsychotic medications and they'd

731
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:34,330
actually had ten sessions of electro

732
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:36,039
convulsive therapy which worked would

733
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:39,220
cause such a bad memory impairment that

734
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:41,470
she couldn't work so she stopped that so

735
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,230
I've been seeing her for a few years as

736
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:45,460
a primary care medical patient and she

737
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:47,139
really didn't have much interest in

738
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,029
changing anything until recently when

739
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:51,309
she said well do you think I should do

740
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:52,809
some more psychotherapy and so I perked

741
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:53,950
my ears up and said well why now and it

742
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,869
turned out she had really been going

743
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,399
down the hill and was starting to have

744
00:30:55,869 --> 00:31:00,750
work consequences and social

745
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:02,768
consequences of her of her depression so

746
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:04,730
this was actually a pretty clear-cut

747
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:06,770
case of treatment resistant depression

748
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:09,340
get almost the same population that all

749
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:11,960
the studies had had been done on so

750
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:13,939
after the workup and the psychological

751
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,150
evaluation we started her in therapy and

752
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,770
added a session of ketamine and the

753
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:21,010
interesting thing here is that the data

754
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:24,110
actually doesn't look that dramatic

755
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:27,230
although the different depression scores

756
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:28,459
did go down by a significant amount the

757
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:30,160
patient actually said she didn't feel

758
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:34,309
any different she didn't think it worked

759
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:37,760
but once again it wasn't the subjective

760
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:39,350
experience that was the most actionable

761
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,240
thing it was but what the therapist

762
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:43,820
noticed all of a sudden they were having

763
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,220
discussions about what was going on

764
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,689
under the surface and she was interested

765
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:51,830
in doing psychotherapy again for the

766
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:55,850
first time in years and she had all this

767
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:57,320
new insight about what what if there

768
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:59,870
isn't it if she had been just doing

769
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:02,928
drugs and different drugs and going to a

770
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:05,299
different psychiatric psychiatrist what

771
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:07,580
if it isn't a physical thing what if

772
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:09,320
this is more of an existential issue and

773
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:13,760
what does that mean for my approach and

774
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:15,260
so after we kind of reflected this back

775
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,690
to her she actually got much more

776
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,950
hopeful so sometimes it's it's not even

777
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:22,250
the measurable things it's the

778
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:24,080
subjective feeling of what happens with

779
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:31,940
people that is the most magical part of

780
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:33,770
this so what have we learned so this is

781
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,710
all very exciting having these sort of

782
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:38,120
quick responses to a drug but that's

783
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:41,510
actually not the thing we're most

784
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:45,110
interested in it wears off after a week

785
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:47,090
or two it's temporary what we're really

786
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:49,820
interested in is coming up with plans

787
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:51,649
for people finding out they can't

788
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,450
execute on those plans and using this as

789
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:57,730
a way to get things on stuck so they can

790
00:32:53,450 --> 00:33:00,559
actually execute on the actual plan and

791
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:03,970
trying to use our human support team to

792
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:06,678
facilitate that and make it safe so

793
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:09,110
really alleviating human suffering is

794
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:12,020
the end here not using a new drug in a

795
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:13,428
fancy way and ethically we actually view

796
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,470
all these tools whether it's self

797
00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:17,650
tracking gadgets and technology and apps

798
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:19,720
and or ketamine as

799
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:22,690
tools to help empower people to achieve

800
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,700
their goals so to that end we're just

801
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:26,380
paying very careful attention with the

802
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,830
language we use and how we present this

803
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:31,690
it's just a tool it's not the end point

804
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:33,699
and I'm just going to end again with

805
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:37,510
this cautionary note the ketamine is not

806
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:40,210
a completely benign substance it has

807
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:42,070
addiction addicted potential and some

808
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:43,690
very bright and forward-thinking and

809
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:48,490
educated people have been taken down by

810
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:49,810
ketamine so on several there have been

811
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,670
several documented deaths by drowning

812
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:55,000
and people in the bathtub shooting

813
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:56,470
ketamine and it's also widely known the

814
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,990
ketamine addicts routine would lie about

815
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:01,150
their use and take extreme measures to

816
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:04,020
avoid getting intervened on or having

817
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:07,450
their supply cut off so as with any

818
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:09,310
really effective treatment ketamine is

819
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:11,380
both a powerful medicine has a powerful

820
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:14,560
potential to alleviate suffering but

821
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:19,390
it's also got a really spooky potential

822
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:21,070
for harm and tragedy so in our medical

823
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:22,750
practice in San Francisco we have this

824
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:24,730
whole context where we can try to do

825
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:27,300
this in an ethical fashion and we're

826
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:31,090
really exploring the ethics of using

827
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:35,190
consciousness expanding agents in a non

828
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:37,720
research setting with real people and so

829
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:39,370
this end of one paradigm if it's done

830
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:41,620
correctly can be a really exciting way

831
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:42,880
to work with people I'd also like to

832
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,830
mention that we are recruiting a

833
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,540
physician so if you know any physicians

834
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:48,219
who would like to do interesting things

835
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,940
in San Francisco just have them get hold

836
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,939
of me thank

837
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,160
happy to take questions after zhenya so

838
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:04,450
we have definitely have time for

839
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:08,620
questions and please come up to this to

840
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:12,220
the open mic and ask him first to

841
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:13,630
comment about the psilocybin research

842
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,779
there was a it was a documentary

843
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:19,030
published last year my producer here in

844
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,260
town called Robert Barnhart haha it's

845
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:22,270
called the new understanding of

846
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,970
psilocybin on the science of psilocybin

847
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:27,550
oh yeah there's been many yeah lots of

848
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:29,830
things yeah so that was you know and

849
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:31,420
it's available online if anyone wants to

850
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:35,529
look at it you can actually download it

851
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:37,480
sure I was interested in so you you

852
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:40,090
really put this within a whole setting

853
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:43,150
of a psychological preparation mm-hmm

854
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:46,900
and how long does that take is this one

855
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:49,600
dose of ketamine you how long does that

856
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:52,420
the experience of that ketamine lasts is

857
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:56,110
it a half hour or two hours or what's

858
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:57,550
sort of the mechanics of it and finally

859
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,970
where do you think this is going in the

860
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:00,940
future

861
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:03,370
ah well that's it that's everything

862
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:08,230
that's that's a very comprehensive

863
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:10,089
question so yeah it actually varies for

864
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:11,980
every patient most of the patients we've

865
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:13,150
done this on so far our patients in our

866
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,720
practice that we know pretty well

867
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,030
already

868
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:19,299
whether it's me seeing them medically

869
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:21,640
for months or years or them were already

870
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:24,310
in psychotherapy in our practice and

871
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:27,100
continued in therapy we're now taking

872
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:29,980
referrals from outside and our basic

873
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:32,430
model is to have at least a few sessions

874
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:35,560
of psychotherapy before before and after

875
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:38,470
to kind of prep people and help them

876
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,509
integrate the experience the protocol we

877
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,770
use for the dose and the duration of

878
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:44,440
action depends on whether we do it

879
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:47,020
intramuscular or IV and whether it's a

880
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:50,290
longer drip or a shorter injection or

881
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:53,830
infusion intramuscular ketamine lasts

882
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:56,350
about 40 minutes of the actual peak

883
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:58,240
effects and people are pretty much back

884
00:36:56,350 --> 00:37:00,700
to baseline by two hours most of the

885
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,200
time but you can run an IV drip of

886
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:05,319
ketamine some of the chronic pain

887
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,700
studies have done 72 hour continuous IV

888
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:10,480
infusions

889
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:11,799
which is pretty grueling actually so we

890
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,660
haven't we haven't done I think that

891
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:17,410
longest we've done is six hours for

892
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:20,220
chronic pain so I'm where does it where

893
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:20,220
is this going in the future

894
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:26,799
well eventually they're going to be more

895
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:28,450
agents available and we're going to be

896
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:31,029
able to figure out what's right for what

897
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:33,939
condition and who and may and have a

898
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:36,670
more nuanced discussion of this really I

899
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,619
think this is just early days most of

900
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:40,960
the psychiatric literature is using very

901
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:45,430
very low dose ketamine barely perceptual

902
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:47,920
maybe mild intoxication effects for

903
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,660
depression but it can be dosed in a

904
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,190
variety of ranges all the way up to

905
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:54,640
anesthesia where you have no memory in

906
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:57,579
your ear just out so some of the

907
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,680
dissociative and psychedelic effects

908
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:01,720
that you get at higher doses may have

909
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,919
benefits in addition to just the basic

910
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:08,470
pharmacology if the low-dose ketamine so

911
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,150
we're interested in that as well but

912
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:12,578
we're not really sure yet of what's

913
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:14,799
right for whom and we're just being is

914
00:38:12,579 --> 00:38:16,990
another person do you use it at all for

915
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:21,700
people who aren't in a depressive state

916
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:25,750
or traumatic stress we use it as a just

917
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:27,879
as enhancer of awareness and you know

918
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:30,250
sort of like ayahuasca would be used or

919
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,980
things of that nature where we're in a

920
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:34,599
medical context and we're using it and

921
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:37,650
we're very mindful of the fact that

922
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:39,730
we're not just in an unrestricted

923
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:41,259
underground environment we're in a

924
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:44,109
medical context so we're really trying

925
00:38:41,259 --> 00:38:47,349
to use it in a similar fashion to what

926
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:49,119
the research has been done on so far and

927
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:51,009
so yeah do you have a way to I think you

928
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,589
like to do a follow-up on that is like

929
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:56,440
what are you seeing any other doctors

930
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:58,210
pick up the kind of suite of techniques

931
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,730
you're using are you hoping to see more

932
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:03,190
of that there's a variety of people

933
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:05,470
doing this around the country mostly in

934
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:09,789
psychiatry and anesthesia for the pain

935
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:11,230
and the psychiatry for depression most

936
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:15,430
of the discussion has been pretty much

937
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:16,900
either in popular press or some in the

938
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:19,500
scientific literature and then a lot of

939
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:21,870
sort of very informal discussions

940
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,670
I think it's there's some movement afoot

941
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:26,779
to make it more regimented or more

942
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:28,740
regulated right now it's pretty much a

943
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:31,020
free-for-all and I think that's why

944
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:33,959
we've we've chosen to do a more

945
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:38,370
structured container instead of doing it

946
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:40,020
kind of ad hoc and you know I think

947
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:41,370
there are many ways you can go with this

948
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,320
we're just choosing the way that we

949
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:45,990
think is the safest and most effective

950
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,760
and that we understand the best to get

951
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:49,620
going and help people because there are

952
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,230
people who need help right now and don't

953
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:55,230
want to wait for everything to be to be

954
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:56,550
sorted out so we're taking I would say

955
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:59,130
we're taking probably a more

956
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:01,020
conservative approach than average which

957
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,970
has some higher cost because there's a

958
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,070
lot more people involved than just

959
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:06,870
having people into their infusion clinic

960
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:09,750
to get a dose ketamine and sending them

961
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:12,049
on their way which may have some benefit

962
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:14,100
but I think it has more risks of people

963
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:16,080
having a harder time integrating that

964
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:18,270
experience the mindset before you take

965
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:22,650
this is very important oh yeah I mean

966
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:26,250
set and setting and the technique and

967
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:28,440
the the way it's framed and the safety

968
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:30,440
and the container are incredibly

969
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,090
important I think that's not being

970
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,650
addressed adequately in the scientific

971
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:37,560
literature I think the studies that are

972
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:39,210
going on with psilocybin and LSD the

973
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,529
people doing the studies I know most of

974
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:43,470
them and they're they're very mindful

975
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:45,150
about this but I think in sort of

976
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:46,560
free-for-all private practice I think

977
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,030
there's a there are a lot of people

978
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,799
jumping into this who don't really know

979
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:51,780
what they're playing with here and it's

980
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:56,070
one more question on medical

981
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:58,940
reimbursement um private pay well it's a

982
00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:00,870
I mean it's a it's a medical visit and

983
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:04,500
there's you know the cost that

984
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:06,330
medication itself is minimal but the

985
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,300
psychologist sessions and the medical

986
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:12,990
visit are potentially reimbursable by

987
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:15,360
insurance so it's it's not any different

988
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:17,100
than any any other medical care the

989
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,780
person who sits with them if they're

990
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,520
doing a long IV infusion that may or may

991
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,350
not be reimbursable I mean they're parts

992
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,810
of this that involve long amounts of

993
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:26,279
time that I think the insurance is and

994
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,600
probably don't understand but the basic

995
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,280
concept of a medical visit and

996
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,359
procedures and psychotherapy is

997
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,339
something that

998
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:37,469
it's fairly straightforward it was nice

999
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:39,839
nice job thank you hi I kind of have two

1000
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:43,319
questions they're not quite as lengthy I

1001
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:47,400
don't think the first one is why is the

1002
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:50,339
ketamine more addictive than some of the

1003
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:53,069
other like psychedelic drugs and the

1004
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:56,989
second question is does the patient need

1005
00:41:53,069 --> 00:41:59,959
to be off of like other like

1006
00:41:56,989 --> 00:42:02,849
antidepressants or pain medication

1007
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:05,939
before they start the treatment and are

1008
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:07,769
you willing to work with like I'm not I

1009
00:42:05,939 --> 00:42:10,439
wouldn't have the ability to go to San

1010
00:42:07,769 --> 00:42:13,379
Francisco so would you be willing to

1011
00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:14,879
work with an open-minded general

1012
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:19,049
practitioner in another area

1013
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,179
hmm why is it addictive actually I don't

1014
00:42:19,049 --> 00:42:25,109
think anybody knows it's very different

1015
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:27,569
in feel from other psychedelics most of

1016
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:30,089
the classical psychedelics are have a

1017
00:42:27,569 --> 00:42:31,949
serotonin neurotransmitter mechanism in

1018
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:34,828
the how they start affecting the brain

1019
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:37,109
whereas ketamine works on this NMDA

1020
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:38,759
receptor and works direct more directly

1021
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:40,199
on glutamate so it's got a very

1022
00:42:38,759 --> 00:42:42,869
different even though it has some of the

1023
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:45,779
same subjective arenas that it works in

1024
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:47,160
the look in the feel of it is very very

1025
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:50,039
different

1026
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:53,549
and it also hits opiate receptors

1027
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:55,769
whereas other psychedelics don't so it's

1028
00:42:53,549 --> 00:42:57,989
also more dissociative than any of the

1029
00:42:55,769 --> 00:43:00,390
other psychedelics is more out-of-body

1030
00:42:57,989 --> 00:43:02,489
you go somewhere else and that the

1031
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:04,410
stories that I've heard from people who

1032
00:43:02,489 --> 00:43:06,239
get addicted to ketamine is that this

1033
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:09,598
other world that they go to becomes

1034
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:11,249
almost more real than this one and that

1035
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,349
changing perspective doesn't really

1036
00:43:11,249 --> 00:43:15,448
change when they stopped it in ketamine

1037
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:18,289
so they have to keep going back there

1038
00:43:15,449 --> 00:43:20,519
that's the that's a common report

1039
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:23,309
instead of being able to bring that

1040
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:25,769
reality into it's hard to integrate with

1041
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:27,959
repeated use outside of the therapeutic

1042
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:31,078
context it can get really tricky because

1043
00:43:27,959 --> 00:43:33,479
people's entire reality shifts in a way

1044
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:38,400
that they can't see so that's pretty

1045
00:43:33,479 --> 00:43:41,459
spooky in my estimation what was the

1046
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,810
last party would you be oh well oh yes

1047
00:43:41,459 --> 00:43:45,490
working with these other doctors and

1048
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:47,680
the person especially if it works on

1049
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:51,509
like dopamine receptors and things like

1050
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:53,950
that including other others on drugs

1051
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:56,910
there are not a lot of direct drug

1052
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:58,990
interactions it may have effects on the

1053
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:03,250
short-term effects on the effectiveness

1054
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:05,709
or the levels of other psychiatric drugs

1055
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:07,450
and other medical drugs so we just every

1056
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:09,040
time we see someone we assess what

1057
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:10,779
they're on and we try to as best we can

1058
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,070
to determine whether there's going to be

1059
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:15,160
an interaction and whether we need to

1060
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:17,650
make any changes but ketamine this

1061
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:20,379
Academy is relatively clean in terms of

1062
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:22,030
its interactions with other drugs in

1063
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:23,710
terms of someone out of state and be

1064
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:26,890
giving advice to another doctor I think

1065
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:28,960
that that would be I feel pretty

1066
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:31,029
confident in our container with our team

1067
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,360
and our protocols and everything being

1068
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:36,460
done I'm a bit OCD myself being done to

1069
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,980
a really meticulous level of attention

1070
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:42,270
to detail I feel pretty safe about how

1071
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:44,350
we're doing things how to teach that

1072
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:46,090
especially over the telephone to someone

1073
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:47,049
I don't know I think that'd be very hard

1074
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:48,930
I

1075
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:51,880
we've seen a lot of things come up that

1076
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:54,609
really take some experience to help deal

1077
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,200
with both in terms of emotional stuff

1078
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:58,630
that comes up and behavioral stuff that

1079
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,149
comes up and even some medical things

1080
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:04,180
with extreme blood pressure elevations

1081
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:06,640
and vomiting and risk for aspiration and

1082
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:08,890
things so it's not a I would say it's

1083
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,620
not a simple it's a complex in in

1084
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:14,200
medical terms to do it right and to do

1085
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:16,150
it safely so that most of the time it's

1086
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,430
simple but when it's not it can be it

1087
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:20,080
can require some readiness to jump into

1088
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:22,810
action over the course of that minute

1089
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,430
how often would somebody from out of

1090
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:26,290
state than if they were interested in

1091
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:28,600
seeing you are going through the program

1092
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:29,170
would you recommend they come and see

1093
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,870
you then

1094
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:33,400
they should just give us a call and we

1095
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:35,200
can talk to them and find out what's

1096
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,150
going on and figure out what makes sense

1097
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,589
because I think everybody's situation is

1098
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:41,770
different and it just depends on how

1099
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:44,650
stable people are and what we think is

1100
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:46,720
going to be the most helpful way to go

1101
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:50,890
but this is not just it's available in

1102
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,270
other states and in other context I mean

1103
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:53,650
I've even heard that Kaiser in Northern

1104
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:54,819
California is doing ketamine for

1105
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:59,529
resistant depression

1106
00:45:54,819 --> 00:46:03,569
so it's a how much are you documenting

1107
00:45:59,529 --> 00:46:06,339
your process our process internally is

1108
00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:08,890
exquisitely documented by my ace

1109
00:46:06,339 --> 00:46:12,038
assistant Stephanie who has come up with

1110
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:13,569
protocols and checklists and how to set

1111
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:15,459
up the room and exactly how to

1112
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:17,709
administer the questionnaires and we're

1113
00:46:15,459 --> 00:46:20,859
gathering you know as best we can we're

1114
00:46:17,709 --> 00:46:22,269
trying to find research instruments and

1115
00:46:20,859 --> 00:46:25,869
questionnaires that we can do to track

1116
00:46:22,269 --> 00:46:28,419
their symptoms so our process is pretty

1117
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:30,189
well documented and then as we change it

1118
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:32,618
we're keeping track of what worked and

1119
00:46:30,189 --> 00:46:34,629
what didn't I hope you publish some of

1120
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:36,489
that um we would love to publish it

1121
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:38,469
except it's also sort of like don't do

1122
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:42,089
this at home at this moment because

1123
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:44,619
there are a lot of the art of this is in

1124
00:46:42,089 --> 00:46:45,819
helping people through the experience

1125
00:46:44,619 --> 00:46:48,640
and whatever comes up which is

1126
00:46:45,819 --> 00:46:50,558
unpredictable so that that is that is

1127
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:54,279
something that is more of a an art than

1128
00:46:50,559 --> 00:47:01,569
a a protocol we're doing okay thank you

1129
00:46:54,279 --> 00:47:04,929
yep thank you yep hi and my question is

1130
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:08,259
have you what types of PTSD have you

1131
00:47:04,929 --> 00:47:10,479
treated with care physical ketamine

1132
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:13,929
ketamine yeah and have you seen

1133
00:47:10,479 --> 00:47:16,569
long-term transformation health-wise or

1134
00:47:13,929 --> 00:47:18,759
mental mentally right and the patients

1135
00:47:16,569 --> 00:47:23,439
are you treated um a couple more

1136
00:47:18,759 --> 00:47:26,650
questions the studies are few right now

1137
00:47:23,439 --> 00:47:28,328
and not long term in the research

1138
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:30,069
literature our experience with ketamine

1139
00:47:28,329 --> 00:47:32,769
we only started doing this in September

1140
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:34,209
of last year with actually with live

1141
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:37,058
patients we've been thinking about it

1142
00:47:34,209 --> 00:47:40,299
for a long time so we don't have

1143
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:42,009
long-term follow-up but we have a few

1144
00:47:40,299 --> 00:47:45,699
cases of PTSD

1145
00:47:42,009 --> 00:47:52,239
some of them with more emotional trauma

1146
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:57,579
or physical trauma from childhood one or

1147
00:47:52,239 --> 00:48:01,769
two depends on your diagnosis and you

1148
00:47:57,579 --> 00:48:05,799
know assessment will one or two military

1149
00:48:01,769 --> 00:48:08,109
PTSD kind of situations that were but in

1150
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:09,729
in reality diagnosis is tricky and a lot

1151
00:48:08,109 --> 00:48:13,749
of people with PTSD also have other

1152
00:48:09,729 --> 00:48:15,759
things going on so I think the studies

1153
00:48:13,749 --> 00:48:18,788
are able to just select only two people

1154
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:20,529
with very pure PTSD symptoms whereas in

1155
00:48:18,789 --> 00:48:23,859
our setting people have more than one

1156
00:48:20,529 --> 00:48:25,539
thing going on so I would say our early

1157
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:27,969
subjective opinion is that yes it's

1158
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:29,619
pretty awesome but if people have other

1159
00:48:27,969 --> 00:48:31,329
things going on there are some other

1160
00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:35,409
conditions that we won't use ketamine

1161
00:48:31,329 --> 00:48:38,049
with so we really are very picky about

1162
00:48:35,409 --> 00:48:40,720
who we select right now what have you

1163
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:41,999
found ketamine to be detrimental for

1164
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,009
[Music]

1165
00:48:41,999 --> 00:48:49,709
there's a class of of conditions called

1166
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:49,709
personality disorders and sometimes

1167
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:56,079
ketamine induces states of mind that are

1168
00:48:52,539 --> 00:48:57,880
pretty alternative and sometimes in

1169
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,159
combination with personality disorders

1170
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,349
it can be pretty upsetting to people so

1171
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:04,029
we're really trying it may be useful but

1172
00:49:02,349 --> 00:49:05,529
but it's really come beyond the

1173
00:49:04,029 --> 00:49:08,949
complexity that we're wanting to take on

1174
00:49:05,529 --> 00:49:11,259
right now people who are there is data

1175
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:12,999
actually now in bipolar disorder and

1176
00:49:11,259 --> 00:49:13,989
mania with ketamine but we're not really

1177
00:49:12,999 --> 00:49:15,999
doing

1178
00:49:13,989 --> 00:49:19,959
ketamine with acutely manic people

1179
00:49:15,999 --> 00:49:22,538
because we're just we really are trying

1180
00:49:19,959 --> 00:49:24,428
to heat the level of drama down to a to

1181
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:25,959
a manageable amount until we get more

1182
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:28,900
experience and can figure out how to do

1183
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:31,118
this so you know of any other countries

1184
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,549
in the world that are using this type of

1185
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:35,939
treatment oh yeah I mean ketamine has

1186
00:49:33,549 --> 00:49:38,469
actually not it's not really that new

1187
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:41,288
even in psychiatric practice but it's

1188
00:49:38,469 --> 00:49:43,089
been pretty under the radar for a long

1189
00:49:41,289 --> 00:49:46,719
time it's only recently that it's gotten

1190
00:49:43,089 --> 00:49:49,929
a lot more press Australia England and

1191
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:52,179
there's a lot of other writing that's

1192
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:53,919
been done about it not a solution is

1193
00:49:52,179 --> 00:49:57,009
it's incredible that you created

1194
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:59,799
something like this that integrative you

1195
00:49:57,009 --> 00:50:03,219
know way of system to heal the patient

1196
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:04,809
right have you work with insurance and

1197
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:07,630
how does that because I have a friend

1198
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:10,900
who called France our doctors and they

1199
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:13,089
deal with this insurance nightmare all

1200
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,739
the time how do you work with them our

1201
00:50:13,089 --> 00:50:15,600
practice has always been what they call

1202
00:50:14,739 --> 00:50:18,810
out of network

1203
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:21,000
I'm really not we're not we don't want a

1204
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:22,680
membership fee but we basically charge

1205
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,350
for our services like plumbers and

1206
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:28,440
electricians but we can help people who

1207
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:31,410
have out of network benefits from a PPO

1208
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,790
insurance to collect what they can from

1209
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:34,830
their insurance afterwards so that's

1210
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:36,810
been the only way we can be innovative

1211
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:38,549
and spend time with people and do things

1212
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:40,259
that because otherwise we'd be

1213
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:42,810
struggling to figure out how to get it

1214
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:45,150
paid for and that would actually take up

1215
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:47,970
all of my time and to of me just to

1216
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:49,680
figure out so we've we've been unwilling

1217
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:51,419
to wait for the insurance system to

1218
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,109
catch up so we're doing this out of

1219
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:55,950
network but we do our best to make it

1220
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:58,410
what I would call the Minimum Viable

1221
00:50:55,950 --> 00:51:01,710
Product like the the least amount of

1222
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:04,170
attention and time and cost that is

1223
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:05,760
going to be responsible so we're doing

1224
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:08,180
our best but I would I would just like

1225
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:11,280
to acknowledge that this is

1226
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:14,279
unfortunately not ready for mainstream

1227
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,960
mass consumption because it has it takes

1228
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:18,420
hours and hours and hours and hours of

1229
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,700
high functioning top of their game

1230
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:22,350
professionals to to pull this off safely

1231
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:24,540
right now you mentioned you need a

1232
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:27,620
doctor what kind of me a family doctor

1233
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:29,430
or specific in this specific field Oh

1234
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:31,859
probably the best match would be a

1235
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:33,899
family medicine doctor or an internal

1236
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:36,210
medicine doctor or maybe some other

1237
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:37,740
specialists who wanted to because we do

1238
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:42,080
a lot of complex just general medicine

1239
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:45,060
in addition to the behavioral stuff so

1240
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:47,640
you know it's just someone who wants to

1241
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:55,830
learn and I guess it's the the best

1242
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:59,810
thing Thanks yeah hi have you or has it

1243
00:51:55,830 --> 00:52:04,230
been used to treat fibromyalgia

1244
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:06,029
fibromyalgia um I don't know actually

1245
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:07,680
that's a good question I don't think

1246
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:09,510
there are any Studies on ketamine for

1247
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,339
fibromyalgia there's there's most of the

1248
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:13,830
studies from the pain literature or on

1249
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:17,670
something called complex regional pain

1250
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:19,440
syndrome which is like if you have an

1251
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:21,510
injury and your pain and then later that

1252
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,540
injury goes away but you still have this

1253
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:27,180
brain response to that limb and it's

1254
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:28,859
more of a central brain phenomenon of

1255
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:31,230
having pain

1256
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:34,319
it these longer infusions of ketamine

1257
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:37,470
seem to be very helpful for for some

1258
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:39,210
people I actually haven't found

1259
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:41,669
literature directly in fibromyalgia but

1260
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:43,319
I think the applicability is potentially

1261
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:47,460
really broad we're just starting with

1262
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:49,829
what is currently documented mostly just

1263
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:51,299
because we don't want it it's complex

1264
00:52:49,829 --> 00:52:55,079
enough already we're trying to keep it

1265
00:52:51,299 --> 00:52:56,849
as simple as we can absolutely I thought

1266
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:59,880
its when you mentioned the chronic pain

1267
00:52:56,849 --> 00:53:03,359
oh yeah I mean it's an obvious target of

1268
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,710
curiosity for me but but I just I don't

1269
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:11,819
have it we haven't we haven't tried that

1270
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:13,799
yet so thanks yeah welcome this NMDA

1271
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:15,749
antagonist space is really interesting

1272
00:53:13,799 --> 00:53:18,630
to me and I was wondering if you have

1273
00:53:15,749 --> 00:53:19,680
either any experience or knowledge with

1274
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:23,849
the research that's going on with

1275
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:26,669
dextromethorphan yeah I'm not another

1276
00:53:23,849 --> 00:53:31,009
classical dissociative drug that has

1277
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:33,299
some you know off recreational use

1278
00:53:31,009 --> 00:53:35,309
millennium like that mostly in creepy

1279
00:53:33,299 --> 00:53:37,769
nice doing some yeah yeah

1280
00:53:35,309 --> 00:53:40,619
dextromethorphan is a subject of some

1281
00:53:37,769 --> 00:53:44,430
research I have not looked into it for

1282
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:46,529
some reason in all of my research into

1283
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:48,269
psychoactive drugs over the years

1284
00:53:46,529 --> 00:53:52,109
dextromethorphan has never really piqued

1285
00:53:48,269 --> 00:53:54,479
my interest so I don't have any direct

1286
00:53:52,109 --> 00:53:56,489
experience with that thank you very much

1287
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,470
yeah great I have a microphone which

1288
00:53:56,489 --> 00:54:00,599
means I get last questions okay yeah

1289
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:02,038
thank you and I want to know what are

1290
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:04,009
the next steps for your clinic what are

1291
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:06,749
you what are you hoping to get into next

1292
00:54:04,009 --> 00:54:10,190
how's it going to develop we're hoping

1293
00:54:06,749 --> 00:54:13,459
to hire another MD or maybe two more MDS

1294
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:16,890
because we have it turns out when you

1295
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:19,019
start really focusing on helping people

1296
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:20,160
and listening to them and working with

1297
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:22,558
them over time there's a virtually

1298
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:25,890
limitless demand for that so we're

1299
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:27,599
growing we'd like to start really

1300
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:29,038
documenting how we do things because

1301
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,470
we've come up with ways of working with

1302
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:33,109
people that are pretty useful and I

1303
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:36,118
think teachable so I'd like to actually

1304
00:54:33,109 --> 00:54:37,410
once we have more clinical help start

1305
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:39,690
documenting what we're doing and

1306
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:41,308
teaching others how we do it because I

1307
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,250
think it's a pretty useful model and I

1308
00:54:41,309 --> 00:54:44,079
think

1309
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:45,900
also maybe documenting the fact that our

1310
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,910
patients consume dramatically fewer

1311
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:50,710
healthcare resources than other similar

1312
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:52,538
patients in other settings because we're

1313
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:56,049
even though there's a big investment of

1314
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:58,869
time upfront we get people on track and

1315
00:54:56,049 --> 00:55:00,640
then they don't need us much over time

1316
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:01,750
when we're able to make that initial

1317
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,430
investment and that's a different

1318
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:05,529
perspective from the rest of the

1319
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:07,480
healthcare world so mostly it's just

1320
00:55:05,529 --> 00:55:09,819
refining our team and then figuring out

1321
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:13,930
how can we how can we teach this model

1322
00:55:09,819 --> 00:55:17,849
of practice so well thank you so much

1323
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:20,169
thank you for the wonderful presentation

1324
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:23,369
now go to the airport difference okay

1325
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:23,369
yeah thanks
