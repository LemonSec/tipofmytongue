1
00:00:34,339 --> 00:01:10,469
so so in many ways they like to think of

2
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,229
what we do and we have a theory about a

3
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:22,859
building block approach we do our entire

4
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:27,679
system is modular I don't know what you

5
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:27,679
get with for me Lego as a child probably

6
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,289
but you know I like to like that

7
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,899
[Music]

8
00:02:51,400 --> 00:03:03,579
so so we've got a variety and so we've

9
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:05,470
also partnered with the company robot

10
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:14,470
they may totally go with hardware 3d

11
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:18,060
printers so what is the range you know

12
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,060
we bring ourselves more than

13
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:40,810
information and computers fundamentally

14
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,240
are based on opponents and so in essence

15
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:54,490
a brain you're bringing the computers to

16
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:56,670
the same language so what I'm trying to

17
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,670
do

18
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:18,159
so this is the background so essentially

19
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:26,650
here we see a channel bio-data it's not

20
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:28,270
only bring it up right now look at the

21
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,890
right side of the street that's that

22
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:45,010
those big lines cross street if you

23
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:52,979
agree but those bars operate I actually

24
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:55,450
control so they also sometimes to do but

25
00:05:52,980 --> 00:06:02,800
what I'd like to do is tell me in which

26
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:08,250
which of those large to move throw them

27
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,250
right okay

28
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:25,359
[Applause]

29
00:06:33,330 --> 00:07:43,270
but software non-electrical remaining

30
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:48,490
into your good ones or discrete steps

31
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:52,659
like your county so that is the primary

32
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:56,910
translator from my brain we need to take

33
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,910
in a lot like rating traffic

34
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:54,989
so they're talking to each other

35
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,989
[Music]

36
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,089
stimulants coming in and this is

37
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,569
whatever you're looking like when we

38
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:27,310
pick it up with a computer so this is a

39
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:31,620
very simply as you can overlay so when

40
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:34,689
we're doing that we get this combination

41
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:40,110
and we want to we want to do subtraction

42
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:40,110
we use something called identity to

43
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:55,929
time and that is raining so Delta which

44
00:09:50,110 --> 00:10:00,749
is very slow we say that he would you

45
00:09:55,929 --> 00:10:00,749
know practice meditators or relaxation

46
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,669
[Music]

47
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:35,559
so when I close my eyes you'll see

48
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:39,369
tendered waveform in channel 2 7 8 and

49
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:41,139
you'll see mainly the brown and red

50
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:44,610
channels come and trying to find my

51
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:44,610
cursor so

52
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,510
[Music]

53
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:42,040
but I think it's also to remember that

54
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,649
it's not when it comes to technology we

55
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,639
have an obligation

56
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:51,959
that Wellingborough from you know the

57
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:53,749
the the phrase exponential innovation is

58
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:56,189
tossed around a lot and I think that

59
00:12:53,749 --> 00:12:58,319
many times it's tossed around with an

60
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:59,519
indifference to human suffering and the

61
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:01,229
fact that there are a lot of people in

62
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:06,629
the world have very little access to

63
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:08,639
technology so keep that this is the

64
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:11,579
story company does the story of my

65
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,040
favorite my favorite time work so this

66
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:16,429
is a module called saw I meant last year

67
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:19,079
actually the same week for the Yannick

68
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:22,860
but I've never gone it's really breakin

69
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:24,508
a copy and so I was there demoing the

70
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,240
first version of the old cortex and

71
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:34,050
going pushed around a wheelchair my best

72
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:36,179
friend here over to our table

73
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:38,998
you know musical chair everything can't

74
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:41,369
see you can barely move his arms but he

75
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:45,089
saw me holding the cortex and his face

76
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:50,879
lit up with this undeniable fascinating

77
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:52,889
and sense opportunity you know I could

78
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,589
see in his face that you wanted this so

79
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:57,540
bad

80
00:13:54,589 --> 00:14:00,600
so I was diagnosed with ALS six years

81
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:03,779
ago since then he's been essentially

82
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,309
hacking his way back so he started to

83
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:07,079
cut the moment he got diagnosed with ALS

84
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:09,870
I started a company called Cygnus peak

85
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:12,540
in a program entire life since then he's

86
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:20,370
been developing his own software to use

87
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:21,959
my dragon so he can write you know we

88
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:24,769
have a lengthy conversation like an

89
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,768
email imagine

90
00:15:22,550 --> 00:17:12,530
this is so you know less serious what's

91
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:12,530
still very serious cognitive disorders

92
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:21,689
that are all related and related to this

93
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,560
machine are actually operates in a

94
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:24,560
predictable way

95
00:17:27,349 --> 00:18:18,149
so they're making it accessible

96
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:20,490
they're allowing students and grad

97
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:29,810
students and researchers the ability to

98
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:36,440
pick up where they left off what if

99
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:48,240
these technologies what if instead

100
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:50,010
someone the ability to you know a DIY

101
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,340
project you're doing together approach

102
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:55,140
to actually solving problems so I'm

103
00:18:53,340 --> 00:19:00,629
looking to the prosthetic space for

104
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:04,980
inspiration I hope that we can get there

105
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:11,300
soon realize the value of these systems

106
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:11,300
from really knowing so it's not

107
00:19:26,950 --> 00:20:29,210
where your based on your or you all of

108
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:36,699
your mental faculties and that's a

109
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:36,700
result of the animal fear anxiety and

110
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,760
instantly what it does it propagates all

111
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,260
those electrical activities you have a

112
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,300
part of your brain is basically saying

113
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,930
like call to arms how do we get out of

114
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,930
this scenario

115
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:26,030
so you we are basically site them down

116
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:30,500
into a very simple code that you bring

117
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:33,649
profit in the same way and then you know

118
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,840
there's this crosstalk between the kind

119
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,190
of the lizard part of the brain that I

120
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,520
like to call it and then the higher

121
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:45,590
complexes which is your brain has

122
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:47,720
evolved over time to not act based on

123
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:49,699
instinct but actually the process and

124
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,470
have a human approach to making a

125
00:21:49,700 --> 00:22:07,990
decision

126
00:21:51,470 --> 00:22:07,990
so this is your PD model so you know

127
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:24,970
because you know for virtual reality

128
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,750
that what game design your perform music

129
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,590
or for new types of really just

130
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:33,960
entertainment

131
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:41,428
I think so

132
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:43,990
why do I live so I don't want to be CI

133
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:45,779
as you probably already know I'm a big

134
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:49,210
proponent of open source a big coupon

135
00:22:45,779 --> 00:23:07,990
free hardware software open access

136
00:22:49,210 --> 00:23:10,960
technology education awareness of the

137
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:13,000
world works but the reality is that when

138
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,460
you open source what you do innovative

139
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,779
things faster the majority of the

140
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,179
technological innovation that's taking

141
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:21,399
place for the opening PCI arbiter system

142
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:23,740
has been done but we're not even getting

143
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:30,209
paid lightly yeah and you know I think

144
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:30,210
this just sees so much to the value

145
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:35,219
maybe other to share what

146
00:23:36,080 --> 00:24:33,300
this is willing to help our project

147
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,409
wanting to work with each other from

148
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:59,550
from different cities different

149
00:24:34,410 --> 00:25:05,760
countries around the world interested in

150
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:07,889
building a browser-based psychological

151
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,660
and neuro science experiment classroom

152
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:11,880
so essentially a place where scientists

153
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:15,420
go to Bill old router many experiments

154
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,070
that you know Darrow and duties around

155
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:19,820
the world who have going BCI Hardware

156
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,820
over zero

157
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:05,809
and you know what would be a cute

158
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:09,290
essentially working to to take advantage

159
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:11,870
of that to rethink what side and then it

160
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:13,940
was bad everybody who seems that human

161
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,040
human interfaces Tech Talk by

162
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,850
aggregating is like the tube you one

163
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:22,580
person's buttons there are exact

164
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:25,699
so actually we did agree enact Montreal

165
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:35,299
where we did open PC guy plus backyard

166
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:37,880
brains and there were the Montreal and

167
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:40,490
we had people's essentially the nervous

168
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,470
systems linked via the internet so there

169
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:46,730
was a train containing selectable nerve

170
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:48,950
stimulator and the BCI on cetera to be

171
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:50,900
people and to one person in Montreal and

172
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:53,240
let their arm and EMG signal would be

173
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,250
picked up set over the internet to

174
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,799
activate the nerve stimulator on the

175
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,280
other person in Amsterdam and then like

176
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:28,200
so they were

177
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:33,330
each other so this was my command

178
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:35,040
so the my God who hears the truth I've

179
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:42,949
seen this act how to act or Eugene

180
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:46,649
anyway okay but so this was done by you

181
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:48,780
do creative technologists and what you

182
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:54,330
like to be and they basically took this

183
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:56,310
$50 toy that had a chip inside of it

184
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:59,250
hacked into an orderly demo build a

185
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:01,409
processing sketch for it and documented

186
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:05,070
the entire thing so so thoroughly then

187
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:07,020
this I think has thousands of comments

188
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:10,409
because so many people around the world

189
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:13,050
have done it this so I did not know when

190
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:18,320
the EEG was or BCI was until I was in

191
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:21,090
grad school in our program and you know

192
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,020
I decided you know what I want to do I

193
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:24,020
want to go in

194
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,099
[Music]

195
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:59,000
so I want to tell you that not only is

196
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:59,000
sharing with me and putting it out there

197
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:05,220
the freedom of information feel like the

198
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:08,060
right thing to do but it really does

199
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,060
foster innovation

200
00:30:13,900 --> 00:31:55,780
but into the room so steadily and

201
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:55,780
reliably and now that's just

202
00:31:55,930 --> 00:32:02,420
not just speaking words enough so like

203
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:05,090
if I condition saying you know lessons

204
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:07,040
learned I just

205
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:09,679
if you don't have to take my word for it

206
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,810
I would say do it yourself

207
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,220
first figure house done do it together

208
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,490
to share with people and then human

209
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,490
brother
