1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:15,040
so next we're going to be hearing from

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:17,110
dr. Rita pregnant oh and she is the CEO

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,470
Marcus when she joined as the army

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:22,660
manager in 2000 and mainly focusing on

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,580
molecular electronics biosensors

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,820
biomaterials and for biomedical

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,198
applications and see textiles so what

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,060
this means is she'll be crying just

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,420
about sensors in clothing that can tell

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:36,370
us and our doctors how we're doing

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,890
wearable monitoring systems embedded in

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,110
fabric that are part of normal garments

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,940
I don't know about you but I love the

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,040
idea of my jacket being able to tell me

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:48,879
more about my life so I'm really excited

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:55,750
to hear from dr. Rita parities oh thank

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:57,789
you thanks a lot for being here and

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,360
thanks for the organizers for inviting

19
00:00:57,789 --> 00:01:03,340
me

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:06,430
very inspiring conference and we see

21
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:10,479
from my presentation that I was a more

22
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:12,549
technical anyway I'm here with more

23
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,689
company that is working me in the

24
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:21,100
research field and basically in the use

25
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:24,100
of textile materials or less a different

26
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:28,408
kind of process we coming from Italy so

27
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:32,589
we are used to consider the textile

28
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:37,689
material that in some way an expression

29
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:40,509
of beauty and seduction and I like to

30
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:45,270
present - so to start with ready -

31
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:50,710
example in which they say material like

32
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:55,530
metal fibers or like optical fiber is

33
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:58,899
used just for special purpose and

34
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:02,829
sometimes also is not only the material

35
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:05,560
itself that is interesting but also the

36
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:09,190
way in which should design playing

37
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,269
around with with the textile and this is

38
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:16,750
another interesting example in which the

39
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:18,890
design allows the person to announce the

40
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:22,040
capacity and

41
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:27,170
in this example this crazy man is

42
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:31,459
abusing this system too but basically I

43
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:35,119
am going to to explain you and to talk

44
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:39,820
about what we have done since 2004

45
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:43,730
either a long time working in the use of

46
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:47,299
textile last home specs extensions like

47
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:51,019
40 realized concern and monitoring

48
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,720
system and all these example being done

49
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:56,570
in a different project in which we have

50
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:00,350
been involved basically the concept is

51
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:05,180
that the textile allows us to guarantee

52
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:08,150
a continuous I'm accessible enough

53
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,489
resistor sensing so this is very an

54
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:13,690
approach that isn't the way different

55
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:16,459
from what I have seen in this conference

56
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:19,910
we want something that's basically the

57
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:21,920
people doesn't read as a device and we

58
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:26,209
want something that these people can use

59
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:30,738
without the in some way look different

60
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:35,030
so we pick metallic and the textile can

61
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:38,269
follow on an angle the day and we can

62
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:41,840
ever and can use the system during the

63
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:44,450
day in its natural situation and this is

64
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,269
the basic concept we want something that

65
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:50,209
is able to collect information for us in

66
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:54,530
a way that cannot be perceived by the

67
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:57,650
other people by that but is also giving

68
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,480
information in a condition in which any

69
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:04,340
other kind of information is also

70
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:09,828
available and here you can see two

71
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:13,489
different system realizes by by us in

72
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:17,900
the two different projects the first one

73
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:24,590
for me the most important people will be

74
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:27,500
the first demonstration and the first

75
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:31,340
position that we have realized exactly

76
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:34,050
the ability study richer we have a

77
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:38,340
mysterious palpable to collect a lot of

78
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:42,780
information and Rella or realized that

79
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:46,140
with textile materials and you can see

80
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:51,510
from the photo that finally just assured

81
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:53,789
we have done this in european on the

82
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:58,140
project so we have done in collaboration

83
00:04:53,790 --> 00:05:00,420
with a seaman which force of physicians

84
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,000
being involved and cardiologists have

85
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,060
been involved so basically they drive

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,240
the development of the piston in a way

87
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:13,740
to be as much similar to work with

88
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:16,050
normally done the clinical practice this

89
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:20,300
means that the assistant finally has the

90
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:23,580
five ECG leads the way to measure the

91
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,790
respiration to impedance a way to

92
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,830
measure the movie monster and also the

93
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:32,520
possibility to combine this information

94
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:37,169
with standard importance standard signal

95
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:39,630
like a co2 signal and i will go in the

96
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:42,690
same later on this system works quite

97
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:47,040
complex also if you look simple that was

98
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:49,260
complex to wear so this is why we move

99
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,580
in the other projects with something

100
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:56,909
that was more simple and is just as

101
00:05:52,580 --> 00:06:00,690
important in the second part and on the

102
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:03,710
right side and it there they we are just

103
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:06,300
one D which is messages I call the other

104
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:09,150
information but basically this is a

105
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,000
system that can be well without any

106
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:14,250
problem and I am wearing it now because

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,210
when collecting the information from in

108
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:20,190
doing this this or not naturally if you

109
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,109
have something you can use this also

110
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,510
during the night and during the night is

111
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:28,800
much important conscious your movement

112
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:32,820
will be less very aggressive but also

113
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,890
you can and by reducing this little

114
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:38,280
estate efficiency and the quality of the

115
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:41,360
signal collect data from the material

116
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,388
that is on your bed for instance so

117
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,629
this is something that we as developed

118
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:50,689
in another project in which we used some

119
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:53,210
conductive bedsheet to collect data and

120
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:55,189
the some sort of the soil on the

121
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,120
mattress to collect information about

122
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:58,490
the movement

123
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,099
about the air straight when the person

124
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:03,469
is not moving and things like that for

125
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:08,330
something that is less up to give them

126
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:11,590
the clothes but the most challenging

127
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:15,650
part is related to the movement

128
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:18,289
basically is interesting to collect

129
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:21,530
information about the movement and the

130
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:24,050
gesture and the posture when the person

131
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:27,198
is moving outside a controlled

132
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,330
environment because you can do a quite

133
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,060
gross reconstruction of the movement if

134
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,698
you have a lot of cameras another thing

135
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,460
which you didn't have any obstacles but

136
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:42,560
it's much more difficult if the person

137
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:46,039
is just doing the normal life and so

138
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,710
when we start basically we start by

139
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:52,250
using a redundant configuration of the

140
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:57,128
sensors and I will explain later which

141
00:07:52,250 --> 00:08:00,969
kind of sensor we use but after and as

142
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:05,210
many shady quite complicated reconstruct

143
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:07,879
within the movement and this is a all

144
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:13,870
the gesture of the person when is doing

145
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:18,319
a real activities we also move to

146
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:21,110
combine combination of pay fabric

147
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,779
pencils together with other kind of

148
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:27,889
sensor in particular I'm black formal

149
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:37,338
which are quite failures now for this

150
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:41,029
kind of odd so now I open the window on

151
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:44,149
the working environment which is really

152
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:46,670
quite important application for this

153
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:48,810
kind of a platform

154
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,990
so basically naturally

155
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:55,260
important to have information about the

156
00:08:51,990 --> 00:09:00,390
physiological sign of a person that is

157
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:04,350
working in dangerous condition in our

158
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:07,860
condition but in this case it is also

159
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:11,460
important to have information about of

160
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:14,880
this person this person is moving in in

161
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:17,220
the scenario in which is working all

162
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,210
this person interact with the other

163
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:23,700
people of the team and what is the going

164
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:26,670
on around and things like that

165
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:31,860
and moreover is important to get the

166
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:38,000
information about abstract so this is

167
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:41,520
the video that was shot during the

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,570
pieces in the project which we have been

169
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:49,370
told that they project is related to the

170
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:54,390
implementation of the HIPAA system for

171
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:59,970
medicine equation and this test was done

172
00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:04,140
at Rena Nederlander in the accident

173
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:07,970
report and basically I show the videos

174
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:11,640
to show that ok we provide system

175
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:14,640
tektite system for the physiological

176
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:18,750
sign opposition and also for the

177
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:23,670
elevated and badging of the older device

178
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:26,730
from the jacket but in our information

179
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:29,790
information provided by our systems have

180
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:34,290
to teach with all the other so basically

181
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:36,329
it's not only they say of the condition

182
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:39,810
of this person that was involved there

183
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:42,570
so from our side the fact that the

184
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:47,880
sensor need to be troubled in answer to

185
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:51,779
the workers also in file conditional in

186
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:54,480
to be protected by the water think like

187
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:57,780
that but it was most important also to

188
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,850
know who will look at this kind of

189
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,300
information and out this kind of

190
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:05,440
information will be

191
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:08,769
using and this is an important part so

192
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,959
how to combine information and down to

193
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:15,700
contextualize this information with the

194
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:20,729
whole way in the situation that is going

195
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:24,910
on another important aspect and and

196
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:29,589
sorry this will be just be too technical

197
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:33,490
but I want to talk about that because

198
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:36,070
the practice everything every people is

199
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,700
talking about just that it is important

200
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:42,550
to understand what we mean process

201
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:46,800
basically stress is defined as the

202
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:49,930
syndrome of of of adaptation to vessels

203
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,260
espressos can come from every region

204
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:58,449
drama critic avenues or normal original

205
00:11:53,260 --> 00:12:01,180
the world and basically the detectable

206
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:04,230
stress he became dangerous is

207
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:07,689
distressing prolonged and in the time

208
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:12,700
lasting too much because we move from an

209
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:17,350
alarming situation to a he exulted after

210
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:21,180
a while but me mainly the stressor can

211
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:24,790
be detected by the penis hormonal

212
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:29,439
response so we will be necessary to do

213
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:31,390
some sort of blaster or alive assess so

214
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,000
if we want to collect information about

215
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:37,829
the death in the natural scenario we

216
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,060
have just people to be one is the

217
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:43,329
response to the letter that we can

218
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:47,079
respond so this scheming feeding the

219
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:50,469
second one is the blood pressure that

220
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:53,349
both of this them are really very

221
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:56,290
affected by the movement so the signal

222
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:58,959
will need no reliable whisper the person

223
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:02,709
is moving too much so the only one is

224
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:06,699
they are trait variability so our create

225
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:07,910
variability is in some way correlated to

226
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:11,519
the

227
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:13,680
interaction between the two nervous

228
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:17,550
system the sympathetic and

229
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:21,388
parasympathetic nervous system they are

230
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:25,170
working together to keep a life so we

231
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:28,050
have to look at the developed between

232
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:34,500
this tooth system so we have to Luther

233
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:37,740
answered a mistake how if we are in a

234
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:41,100
condition in which the parasympathetic

235
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,259
nervous system is dominant we will be

236
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,350
relaxed it if you are in the condition

237
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:49,550
with the sympathetic system nervous

238
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:52,550
system is domina we will be more active

239
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,550
so

240
00:13:53,379 --> 00:14:01,449
we have methodology to look at this kind

241
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:04,868
of information and I just want to stress

242
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:10,539
the faxes methodology we'll start from

243
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:17,169
this rickety signal so basically we have

244
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:21,129
to look at going to see we have to look

245
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:26,379
at the ETD signal and we had to look at

246
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:29,879
this QRS complex which is this one any

247
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:34,449
particular we have to look at our teach

248
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:36,970
this is the input and if this input is

249
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:39,728
not good if the quality of the signal is

250
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:43,479
not good all the information that we can

251
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:45,220
get later are not reliable so basically

252
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:49,239
what is important is the difference

253
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:53,470
between this speech and this system is

254
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:56,799
working to say evaluate is this one in

255
00:14:53,470 --> 00:15:00,609
the deep system that it changes is not

256
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:02,039
blockage canta canta can be a little

257
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:05,379
value ater

258
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:10,499
in the car in the frequency domain so we

259
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:14,619
can check if we as the sister-in-law

260
00:15:10,499 --> 00:15:20,889
frequency or if we add this stuff in

261
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:25,089
high frequency when we have the local

262
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:27,639
administration of both our system the

263
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:30,249
parasympathetic and sympathetic when we

264
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:33,549
are high frequency we have an expression

265
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:37,449
of Duster the parasympathetic system so

266
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:41,439
basically the i7c means so that we are

267
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:44,949
relaxed while the location is related to

268
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:47,228
both so if we make the rest between the

269
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:50,469
low frequency in the Icicle we have an

270
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:55,179
expression of the sympathetic and only D

271
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:59,049
so here I just proposed some real data

272
00:15:55,179 --> 00:16:02,379
this is the result of a study that we

273
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:05,250
are doing with water during the world

274
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:08,970
day of water and here you can

275
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:13,350
that business this is done in our

276
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:17,040
measuring around eight hours of work we

277
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:20,570
have the relation between low frequency

278
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,430
and expectancy and week Nia we have the

279
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:27,180
expression of the parasympathetic so

280
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:29,430
just relax and if we combine this with

281
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:32,280
some information about the physical

282
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:35,069
activity finally we can get something

283
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:39,560
like that so during the day during the

284
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:41,010
working time to know if the person being

285
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,430
relaxed

286
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:47,640
how much is a sea of normality and when

287
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:50,670
the person is being mentally stressed

288
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:55,710
and when this person is the physically

289
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:59,189
stressful I just introduced it because

290
00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:01,620
it's important to understand this from

291
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,720
the quality of the data we can really

292
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,579
like a lot of information but finally

293
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,209
the data the beginning need to be good

294
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:10,859
otherwise the information that we get is

295
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:13,860
not reliable

296
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:19,550
so basically going back to the material

297
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:24,448
and what what can be which kind of

298
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:29,220
fabric session we are conducting much

299
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:32,520
material allow to get some electrodes

300
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:35,610
and kind of by electrodes and this is

301
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,710
the kind of resources are normally uses

302
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:41,270
as well

303
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:46,340
Olympic give this is the fabric which is

304
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:49,830
basically a public purpose that will be

305
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:52,800
changing the resistance when it presses

306
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:57,330
these are the two kind of there so that

307
00:17:52,800 --> 00:18:00,780
we mainly use that also if we can use

308
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:04,439
the optical fiber corresponds to the

309
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:10,080
state inject and lighter and to collect

310
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:14,160
information about the powerful so here

311
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,850
just to summarize well if we are the

312
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:21,090
electrode

313
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:24,969
we can collect by potential like TG like

314
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:28,709
electromyography to look at the stage

315
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:33,429
activity of the muscle and then also

316
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:36,130
impedance if we have P the v6 s electron

317
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:38,440
let's go biomechanical sensor we can

318
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:41,350
collect information about the movements

319
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,110
of her during the respiration a CVC at

320
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:46,830
the correct level abdominal level we can

321
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:49,809
collect information about the

322
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:52,210
speculation of today the movement of the

323
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:54,070
joint and naturally all this can be

324
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:58,840
combined with other kind of a

325
00:18:54,070 --> 00:19:03,370
traditional senses and just a word about

326
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:06,730
the technology basically what we need is

327
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:08,979
something that is fitting the skin and

328
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:12,370
the body so we need an elastic material

329
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:16,120
and the best technology to have an

330
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:19,330
elastic Republic is Earth in continuous

331
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,939
acknowledge just because this is coming

332
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:24,120
from the nursery world and these were

333
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:27,159
technology that allows you to combine

334
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:31,928
very elastic fiber with the traditional

335
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:35,230
condom going to the fiber you want to go

336
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:37,059
in with watch but this is example of the

337
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,270
first kind of a lecture that we have

338
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:42,820
Lucas so in this case we have a

339
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:47,470
monofilament of the safety and combiners

340
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:52,149
with traditional fiber and this is what

341
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:55,570
we are using 9 now is the we have some

342
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:59,070
metal fibers again say steel in this

343
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:03,309
case they are more and they are always

344
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:04,840
included in the textile fibers when they

345
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:07,990
they let's say the yard

346
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,730
melissa is done and it is working

347
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:14,940
normally user then can be found

348
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:19,270
commercial resources is a place of the

349
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:23,679
fiber that normally they take Lisa a

350
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:25,590
silver particles and if you say the kind

351
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,049
of the sensor that we use for

352
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:30,279
biomechanical part so basically is the

353
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:35,070
realizes with

354
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:39,809
a carbon we know that iverson

355
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:44,619
particularly the parlament but today the

356
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:47,440
state properties to be given a

357
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:51,668
resistance is given by the combination

358
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:56,639
with an elastic fibers together so it's

359
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:59,710
in the wall wall fabric that is the

360
00:20:56,639 --> 00:21:03,968
behaving like a sense or not to the yarn

361
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:07,059
itself you can see here in the middle

362
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:09,669
that there is an elastic fiber you can

363
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:11,678
see here what happens with when I

364
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:14,200
stretch the material so when I stretch

365
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,950
the material basically Ahmad space he

366
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:21,009
modified the part of the day charge and

367
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:23,710
so the resistance in the material is

368
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:26,919
changing and the elasticity allow me to

369
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:33,669
have a sample that is the same as now

370
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:36,820
any aesthetical effect so the I told you

371
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:38,979
before this was the first prototype that

372
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:43,389
we a lie so the first application was

373
00:21:38,979 --> 00:21:48,129
working this was ready around 2004

374
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:50,769
approximately and here we have a lot of

375
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:55,119
the electrical that are all integrated

376
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:58,570
in the target and this you see are just

377
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:01,238
a connection for everything is textile a

378
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:04,089
lot of fabric a lot of electrons will

379
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:06,759
distributed that allows with where the

380
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:10,719
configuration for the EEG that is the

381
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:14,759
traditional one so reverse these pieces

382
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:20,320
and totally listen to record early and

383
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:22,179
yeah the recording kind of a signal

384
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:27,849
which is quite good to tell if the

385
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:30,639
person is not moving too much and you're

386
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:33,309
the impedance measurement by using the

387
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:35,859
electrode is also possible to collect to

388
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:38,678
measure the the change of the impedance

389
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:42,810
of the body that is due to the fact that

390
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:45,090
we are breathing so basically you can

391
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:49,500
yes information about the respiration

392
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:52,679
India is the comparison between our

393
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:58,140
signals with textile material and the

394
00:22:52,680 --> 00:23:00,710
gold standard but I told you that this

395
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:04,650
was too complex the reason is that

396
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:09,840
basically to get a good signal you need

397
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:12,540
to use a sort of gel so basically this

398
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:16,110
system requires the person to prepare

399
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:18,389
that the shirt before producing and this

400
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:20,760
was not the philosophy of this approach

401
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:23,640
approach Lydia was I want something that

402
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:27,180
I want to wear and XO know what to do

403
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:30,540
nothing so what we do we reduce the

404
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:37,320
complexity of the system and not nervous

405
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:39,870
and we simply think II decided to put

406
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:44,210
just two electrodes in the place that

407
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:47,610
was the more robust term of Nazi

408
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:50,370
business control structure and also we

409
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:54,360
go for the solution which shall be some

410
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:58,530
way and after the humidity in this in

411
00:23:54,360 --> 00:24:02,370
the lecture region by populating this

412
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:06,120
the delay should just around the

413
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:08,929
position and also by using some sort of

414
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:13,469
seal of layers to increase the pressure

415
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:17,460
so basically disappear sensor electrical

416
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:23,100
figuration of some electro music for EMG

417
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:27,810
accretion and naturally validates the

418
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:30,840
dilation but also this the way in which

419
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:33,240
the garden is filled with important

420
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,149
because of the way the design allows you

421
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:40,620
to locate the lecture in the proper

422
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:45,000
position so here you see the the system

423
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:48,300
working and this this

424
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,900
pipin was just down to test the factor

425
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:59,460
that was possible to get really

426
00:24:51,900 --> 00:25:03,990
no really minute and I was just moving

427
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:07,530
and the system was able to monitor the

428
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:11,190
activity of the del Sol and this

429
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:16,020
application was was important in the

430
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:18,660
framework of a project in which we want

431
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:21,320
to see the difference between the movie

432
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:26,880
mentor of the person affected by stroke

433
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:30,320
so the theater resistive sensors can be

434
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:33,660
forced to use the potato before to

435
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,928
discriminate between the different

436
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:40,260
respiration at abdominal and the thorax

437
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:45,120
level and to see the government of the

438
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:47,580
join or also by combining two piece of

439
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,969
pencils and looking at the difference

440
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:54,059
between them to have a source of gaudiya

441
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:57,000
meters and again this is the validation

442
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:59,639
of the golden meters or comparison

443
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,950
between the signal that you can catch

444
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,440
from the textile goniometer and the

445
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:07,920
signal that you can get from our

446
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:15,240
platform for doing a movement of them

447
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:20,100
and with the three most located and on

448
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:22,230
the carton of the time so basically if

449
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,949
we combine and been talking about

450
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:28,200
special fusion approach body area

451
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:31,700
network approach whatever you want to

452
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:35,960
call if we combine all different sensors

453
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:40,920
we can never attain more efficient the

454
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:45,660
more efficient system once the

455
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:51,330
conditioner is soft show you a graph in

456
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:54,480
which you have then the extra special so

457
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:57,750
that are give ester to recognize the

458
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:01,350
gesture so basically the system is just

459
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,920
able to recognize the just quality and

460
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:06,649
to

461
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:10,800
move from one situation into the other

462
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:13,590
here you can see a better self which is

463
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:17,000
two different special are combined in

464
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:22,939
the textile and the new Mostafa

465
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:27,960
naturally Aquabus can be optimized to

466
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:33,210
prove the approach and the as you can

467
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:37,350
see from from the reconstruction we the

468
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:40,830
season is much more sensitive to also

469
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:44,699
comply moment and this was you that just

470
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:48,870
to confirm the difference except ability

471
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:51,870
to move not from an affected side of the

472
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:54,840
stroke fashion of the left and a

473
00:27:51,870 --> 00:28:01,469
unaffected the part that is worth this

474
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:05,490
is on the right and in this frame of the

475
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:09,570
same project and the name of the project

476
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:17,520
is the interaction in this dish is just

477
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:21,570
again a result in which we have reported

478
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:23,490
to the position of the hand at the

479
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:27,629
position of the health or the position

480
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:30,090
of the shoulder location that affect the

481
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:35,100
position of the present when the

482
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:39,959
patient's of all the iron Knight was

483
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:43,379
with just doing this kind of holiness so

484
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:46,860
reaching they do some circular movements

485
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:50,760
and in the bottom the depression was

486
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:55,050
just working in the soil here you can

487
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:59,160
see how the difference have are in the

488
00:28:55,050 --> 00:29:06,990
working they mistake the monumental of

489
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:09,750
the two the two side okay so we have

490
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:12,510
senior hours in importance to combine

491
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:14,140
the same surface to get a system that is

492
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:22,020
more efficient

493
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:26,610
now the respect no further this help

494
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:34,030
address listen man voice and this is

495
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:37,810
another project in which there is say is

496
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:42,870
the BTC study about multivariable

497
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:46,899
approach what governing this we are

498
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:51,600
considering here the fact that not only

499
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:54,070
is taking information from the

500
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,730
physiological sign from the central

501
00:29:54,070 --> 00:30:00,580
importance but the idea is to combine

502
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:02,860
this kind of information with other

503
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:07,350
information which kind of information

504
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:11,020
basically personality and also

505
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:14,020
biochemical screening but mainly the

506
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:18,120
information that can come from the

507
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:21,070
person so information that the person is

508
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,889
let's say is putting the fission is

509
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:28,300
giving to the system and this is the

510
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:31,120
project this was addressing people with

511
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:34,060
mental disease any particularly people

512
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,250
with bipolar disorder and it is very

513
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:39,310
interesting because this kind of people

514
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:42,550
move from a different station a

515
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:45,159
different behavior they can go from the

516
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:48,610
depressive station which they sleep so

517
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:51,880
for instance then our tents in our today

518
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:55,090
they don't move the zonal activity among

519
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:57,610
young station which they sleep they

520
00:30:55,090 --> 00:31:00,070
sleep just three hours so they are very

521
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:04,179
active they do love to they talk a lot

522
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:09,610
as well so the difference are quite huge

523
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:13,600
and basically this is the challenge was

524
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:16,290
to demonstrate that we combine all this

525
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:20,830
information together we can even more

526
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:23,680
sensitive systems able to check the

527
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:27,020
emotional state of the person but we can

528
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:31,970
also go for a prediction of the next day

529
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:36,350
so this is the important part so going

530
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:38,930
back to what is our part basically it's

531
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:42,350
the platform this would usually the

532
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:44,540
processing pick one so I told you we try

533
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:46,969
to simplify the shirt is not the sort of

534
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:49,909
possible disposition that we are

535
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:52,970
normally using is very simple the

536
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:56,210
material can be changed and we are the

537
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:59,450
basically three kind of a textile sensor

538
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:02,750
there are two electrodes earlier and one

539
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:05,930
sensor for the restoration and the

540
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:09,950
system is the connected with an

541
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:14,210
electronic box in which the reason is a

542
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:14,930
sort of I'm of platformer with a little

543
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:17,000
information

544
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:19,610
pretty accelerometers that is give

545
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,400
information about the movement and the

546
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:25,729
PvP in the console

547
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:29,120
basically the kind of rho sigma1 they

548
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:31,420
legally depends very stress how

549
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,949
important is the quality and the

550
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:36,620
respiration and the you can get

551
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:40,940
information about the heart rate Beijing

552
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:42,649
races they have asked distance and you

553
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:45,020
can information creates information

554
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:49,610
about the ability by looking at the

555
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:52,870
accelerometer so for the person is

556
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:57,530
moving and you how much energy is

557
00:32:52,870 --> 00:33:00,139
pending some way and also have a sort of

558
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:05,330
a specification about the piracies with

559
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:10,030
the brand with the standing working or

560
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:14,030
sleeping in which position is living and

561
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:16,790
naturally populate parameters related to

562
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:21,110
the heart rate variability and stress as

563
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:24,440
I showed a beautiful but most important

564
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:27,889
is the fastest road Vista are combined

565
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:31,430
with behavioral information that are

566
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:35,830
coming from the smartphone or tablet or

567
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:40,850
the computer and with personality and

568
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:44,960
basically we don't we have a lot of

569
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:48,490
red all over this the day in the night

570
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,559
but basically we want to use the

571
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:56,720
premiership from the signal just and

572
00:33:51,559 --> 00:34:02,149
feature for instance how many times have

573
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:05,299
left the past nine or the water they

574
00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:08,960
illustrate the lassithi of the ram-paige

575
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:12,980
because we can well digitally recognize

576
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:16,300
this new stage or the hence repiy of the

577
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:18,949
signal so basically number the circle

578
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:21,919
join together with the other information

579
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:25,009
that are coming from the edge.a mood

580
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:29,000
agenda a self assessment of the quality

581
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:31,639
of sleep or information that can be

582
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,810
quite fast enough about how many

583
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:39,619
cigarettes I smoke as many df/de drunk

584
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:43,879
and so on so well together

585
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:47,419
if the giving answer the sort of matrix

586
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:51,739
the death can be treated for the data

587
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:53,989
mining and giving us some feel about the

588
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:56,750
classification of the stage and it's

589
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:59,569
possible the prediction of the next day

590
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:04,670
so this is verge of the medical portal

591
00:34:59,569 --> 00:35:07,490
naturally the physician can decide which

592
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:11,000
find the classic or the purple will do

593
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:14,118
together with the patient's s this is

594
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,119
just some things that can be seen by the

595
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:21,079
physician numbers on the web related to

596
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:24,560
the lesser quality quality designing the

597
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:29,720
bed I'll be the person feel the patient

598
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:33,529
here again information about the voice

599
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:37,160
and the voice that can be analyzed in

600
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:41,000
server feature in term of the amount in

601
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:46,270
term of the little lastness of teachers

602
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:49,160
we're also together with the world today

603
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:51,859
and this is what was really important

604
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,339
staff in the real challenge because it's

605
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:56,220
depend by the

606
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:59,270
people that is analyzing the time in

607
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:02,040
which we analyze the people in Taoism

608
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:06,270
contextualizes information but if the

609
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:09,480
predictions are so if we know the what

610
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:14,310
our senses and we combine all this

611
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:17,370
indicator one day to prevent what could

612
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:22,320
happen in the next day or the next week

613
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:24,089
with so basically this is the goal of

614
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:30,570
this approach

615
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:34,320
and finally what going out now and this

616
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:38,940
is a prototype is just after the

617
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:41,880
beginning with a very complex title book

618
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:45,120
let's go letter mind what is important

619
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:49,640
in comparison with work goes down the

620
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:52,200
for now the dependency is to give

621
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:57,330
something to the people for the

622
00:36:52,200 --> 00:37:01,020
self-management so to say simplifying

623
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:04,470
and to collect information and to

624
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:07,380
combine on this information to give the

625
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:10,850
decision support system that is able to

626
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:15,930
run on a smartphone and is able to

627
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:19,319
provide the indicators to the person in

628
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:24,049
which context okay this this project is

629
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:28,730
for people that as it is primary

630
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:32,340
diseases which is something very they

631
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:37,280
can be very heavy and they start to know

632
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:41,480
about this like a culture like problem

633
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:47,100
related to some amputation this kind of

634
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:51,360
scenarios and they can in a developer

635
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:54,839
depression and the third area is to work

636
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:59,250
on a system that is able to help them to

637
00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:00,930
test manage this the possibilities over

638
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:04,980
depression income

639
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:07,259
so basically we move from

640
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:10,710
disease in Hawaii located by the

641
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:14,510
physician to give more information and

642
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:20,310
biofeedback and a need to refer to the

643
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:27,380
depression sister so I just got the hang

644
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:27,380
I want to put some some question and to

645
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:33,420
discuss with you I show you what was the

646
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:37,140
state of the art so basically in the

647
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:39,120
past the demonstrator and we work on the

648
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:42,750
illustrative quality of the signal that

649
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:46,790
can be acquired by text and material

650
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:50,640
just because the stylist with the most

651
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:53,670
page it's a nice table there is the

652
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:58,100
material and the interfaces is most

653
00:38:53,670 --> 00:39:01,370
close to our body sort of secondary skin

654
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:06,480
naturally if we have something implanted

655
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:09,240
okay but after that how that signal and

656
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,670
deformation can be correlated and which

657
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:13,140
kind of information we can correlate and

658
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:16,170
this was a mistake

659
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:21,240
what's going on now what will be the

660
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:23,970
future and then we can now probably we

661
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:30,209
will have system that will be more and

662
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:33,990
more efficient in besides and understand

663
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:38,220
our emotional state in the side and

664
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:40,319
understand our healthy station but how

665
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:43,620
this information will be used we are

666
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:47,550
going for in humanized technology we are

667
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:51,509
going for an interaction with this

668
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:57,480
machine that will be more and more with

669
00:39:51,510 --> 00:40:01,710
the empathic and so which part of us and

670
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:06,990
in which way we believe all of this work

671
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:11,130
of new things and approaches right so

672
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:14,439
basically in conclusion as I told you

673
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:19,210
this textile using more most

674
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:23,950
the faces the skin and we really can

675
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:27,760
have import of the production of our key

676
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:30,939
if you want with all these devices that

677
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:34,030
we need to combine for the information

678
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:37,030
we need to go for a multi variable

679
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:41,950
approach we need to be able to manage

680
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:45,970
call of information and basically is

681
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:50,680
possible to get reliable the features

682
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:52,990
from all the water is in a challenge how

683
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:58,808
the data are management and management

684
00:40:52,990 --> 00:41:03,250
and big challenges I'll just ask you and

685
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:06,190
the big challenge is how we will go for

686
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:09,869
the ethic treatment of data because

687
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:14,109
naturally with this information is given

688
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:16,450
the way telling this to all the world of

689
00:41:14,109 --> 00:41:19,509
what occurs throughout sometimes what we

690
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:26,020
never know but which we go to other

691
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:37,210
people so I thank you for your attention

692
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:39,190
I am looking for in question thank you

693
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:42,010
so much we've definitely up some time

694
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:43,990
for questions just take yourself on over

695
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:45,779
to that Center might ask questions and

696
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:49,868
we'll start with this gentleman here

697
00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:51,970
very interesting presentation to what

698
00:41:49,869 --> 00:41:55,900
extent is this being commercialized at

699
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:57,399
this stage and also that's one question

700
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,099
the second question the follow-up to

701
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,260
that is as you start to monitor this in

702
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:05,109
a continuous sense you get this time

703
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:07,089
series data that's very difficult to you

704
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:08,910
know extract out what's really happening

705
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:13,450
or the very abilities from day to day

706
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:15,069
moment to moment and so where what's the

707
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,839
status of this technology and the

708
00:42:15,069 --> 00:42:19,390
commercialization and what are you doing

709
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:23,459
around the challenge of really

710
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:27,069
monitoring people on a 24/7 type of

711
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:32,578
okay basically the platform that I show

712
00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:37,630
we we sell out so if her doctor lets say

713
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:40,119
on the web level and and medically our

714
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:45,419
customer are the third sensors because

715
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:48,939
it is an open platform and in in fact

716
00:42:45,419 --> 00:42:51,640
each time you apply this platform to a

717
00:42:48,939 --> 00:42:55,569
different kind of application you see

718
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:58,868
the limitation and you see how important

719
00:42:55,569 --> 00:43:02,288
is that which the signal in the proper

720
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:04,839
way I shown an example of the study that

721
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:06,849
we are doing now which i think is quite

722
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:11,140
interesting because it's something that

723
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:15,429
is not in the frame of project because

724
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:19,749
in the project that basically you ever

725
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:24,339
they say an artifact situation because

726
00:43:19,749 --> 00:43:26,828
the inside you have also stand user in

727
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:30,999
this case is just something external and

728
00:43:26,829 --> 00:43:36,880
we are basically collecting data during

729
00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:39,428
the day of approximately is the employer

730
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:44,849
and they are using the system during the

731
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:48,189
Working Day and and we have seen how

732
00:43:44,849 --> 00:43:50,529
important if I stretch the quality of

733
00:43:48,189 --> 00:43:53,199
data because there are people which the

734
00:43:50,529 --> 00:43:55,209
system is not working properly while for

735
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:56,759
the people mission system is working ok

736
00:43:55,209 --> 00:44:01,569
this kind of information

737
00:43:56,759 --> 00:44:05,319
nearly Golder and system very well so I

738
00:44:01,569 --> 00:44:09,969
think is not far away from well know to

739
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:13,869
be user to this approach basically what

740
00:44:09,969 --> 00:44:18,759
is difficult is to to the technology of

741
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:23,409
the actual issues and also to take to

742
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:25,659
motivate this person to use it when his

743
00:44:23,409 --> 00:44:27,130
necessary I don't believe that this is

744
00:44:25,659 --> 00:44:31,380
the way that has to be used

745
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:35,190
24 hours ok my opinion up to be you

746
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:38,520
proper time made mainly to train people

747
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:42,270
to collect the art art and to go for

748
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:45,420
some sort of target understand more and

749
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:48,420
later on to make something that is more

750
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:50,070
anything to be little time it seems to

751
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:53,760
me like it's almost like a biofeedback

752
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:55,980
system yeah ultimately you know there's

753
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,510
other systems or Apple or knowledge to

754
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:00,930
wrap around what you're because you're

755
00:44:57,510 --> 00:45:02,700
collecting the raw data anyway yeah and

756
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:04,950
then putting it in context of what of

757
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:08,189
what is happening so that that person

758
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:09,810
can make modifications to the their

759
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:12,750
environment their situation and

760
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:17,970
potentially improve it I mean that's is

761
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:20,520
that your vision division is that there

762
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:22,709
is a lot to do in the way of this

763
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:27,270
information are combined as we build

764
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:30,600
that and basically we start to structure

765
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:33,990
the katifaq in this family and the

766
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:36,270
department is still missing really the

767
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:41,430
kind of people the best kind of feedback

768
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:50,610
and also to give it because it depends

769
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:51,690
to the big concept thank you thank you

770
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:54,480
that was great

771
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:56,580
I'm curious what challenges you've come

772
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,850
up with actually getting people to use

773
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:02,430
this from a sort of user experience

774
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:04,100
perspective wearing the shirt playing

775
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:07,980
with the app dealing with the data

776
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:09,450
transmission back to the server's how

777
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,280
are you how are you dealing with some of

778
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:16,230
those challenges to get real people to

779
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:20,990
use this in their everyday life what is

780
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:23,670
the difficulty mean there are many times

781
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:26,160
basically okay we can divided to

782
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:28,590
accorded the kind of appreciation and

783
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:32,790
let me say this

784
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:39,510
me because a Newton decision is how to

785
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:42,600
be engaged by the system so to start to

786
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:50,790
use it in a way that is giving you some

787
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:54,440
some salsa that is asking you to know

788
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:58,290
more about your reaction result are you

789
00:46:54,440 --> 00:47:01,320
your body works and things like that

790
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:04,020
because it speaker challenges the

791
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:09,810
motivation this is one the second big

792
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:14,910
challenge is how to to use this

793
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:17,549
information so to give a today the users

794
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:23,399
that are something the de feeling desert

795
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:27,750
is the something useful okay so the

796
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:30,030
feedback the combination they respond

797
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:32,460
the monetary for a long time which is

798
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:35,130
something that is completely new the

799
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:38,910
trend because with this system we can

800
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:42,660
reconstruct the life of for whatever for

801
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:46,259
the world life and so you can add data

802
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:49,290
about our happened within the body was

803
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:52,140
working when you were 20 and eight-hour

804
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:57,050
what happens when you are 40 is he on

805
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:57,049
the trend and in something feasible I

806
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:02,220
won't ask a follow on to that actually

807
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:05,839
your talk about amazingly robust data

808
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:08,759
that is literally very close to us and

809
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:10,350
what do you see is the privacy

810
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,970
implications like at least with my

811
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:14,250
smartphone which gives me no privacy

812
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:16,020
yeah I can leave it at home and go

813
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:19,560
somewhere you're like it's not watching

814
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:22,530
me if I take off my smart shirt then you

815
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:26,250
know I've taken it all I can't even hide

816
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:28,110
that and I'm coloring like where is it

817
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:29,430
is there a point where you need to

818
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:32,570
balance between the health benefits of

819
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:35,790
the potential privacy violations you

820
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:38,580
sense when we big after that you feel

821
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:40,020
nice or going I mean you can send the

822
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:42,390
data

823
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:44,640
that is in the cloud or something that

824
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:49,680
we look at you better you can have your

825
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:52,799
beta just you know how and I mean the

826
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:56,609
way you can manage audio can also tend

827
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:59,700
to just what you warm to the cloud and

828
00:48:56,609 --> 00:49:05,220
choose the director in a very liberal

829
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:08,669
perfect environment but finally is up to

830
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:10,558
you you can decide which is just me

831
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:12,119
another interesting Credle that

832
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,559
interfaces yeah to make sure people

833
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:16,230
understand the decisions that they're

834
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:18,900
making yeah because if you don't feel

835
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:21,799
whether the system is asking you

836
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:26,400
finally after one you will stop reuse it

837
00:49:21,799 --> 00:49:28,710
but if I see that the system is giving

838
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,680
me some information that is difficult

839
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:34,049
for me or just a curiosity to to

840
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:37,529
understand how my body works

841
00:49:34,049 --> 00:49:40,349
it keeps me engaged to you see you

842
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:42,839
couldn't not kill you and also I think

843
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:45,059
the kind of information that basically

844
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:48,089
will be beautiful is something that

845
00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:52,290
really discover it's not something that

846
00:49:48,089 --> 00:49:54,869
we know now I mean in the time you can

847
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:58,529
understand what is important for you and

848
00:49:54,869 --> 00:50:02,210
basically what is important is the

849
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:06,390
change in the trend so it can come

850
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:10,290
something that is not the normal pattern

851
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:13,098
so this is one cup basically the system

852
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:16,349
will look like if you have a trend

853
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:19,260
difficulty change means that something

854
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:26,670
happens and you have to understand if

855
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:28,589
what if this is the problem or not nice

856
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:30,660
presentation I have a couple of

857
00:50:28,589 --> 00:50:34,349
questions the first one is on user

858
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:37,259
compliance I do you think how the user

859
00:50:34,349 --> 00:50:39,690
are going to behave in terms like on in

860
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:43,440
terms of long term use and the second is

861
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:46,200
like if you are monitoring a behavior

862
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,480
its subconscious it kind of changes that

863
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,549
we have you automatically if the user is

864
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,780
just aware so what do you think like

865
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:53,550
using such a system

866
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:57,260
in a long-term how it's going to change

867
00:50:53,550 --> 00:51:02,310
user behaviors subconsciously

868
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:05,010
okay complaining what user compliance

869
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:15,600
like hovering they are going to be to

870
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:19,140
use the system well basically they say

871
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:23,069
if in some way we need to agree they do

872
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:27,870
they need to to the side that is going

873
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:32,190
to to use something like that so I think

874
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:36,000
not all the user winner will agree to be

875
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:39,270
monitored for a long time or for a long

876
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:44,340
period or to send information Makara

877
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:47,430
maybe just collected during the normal

878
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:49,770
life they will just decide when to use

879
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:53,940
the system and will not use the system

880
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:57,180
and i don't think i think that the

881
00:51:53,940 --> 00:52:03,000
selected class of people will not all of

882
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:05,370
them that's the stage in migration so

883
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,490
the people that are motivated with live

884
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:12,770
at least and the other people will not

885
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:15,990
but just we need to also go to the

886
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:19,650
clarify that the working is is if you

887
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:22,589
are going to use the system because you

888
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:24,420
like it or another thing is if you are

889
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:27,810
going to use the system because the your

890
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:31,590
physician told you to use so this will

891
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:34,500
make the difference between the source

892
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:38,190
of clinical device or something that for

893
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:44,550
the well-being device and system overall

894
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:47,250
cortical and so basically this is also

895
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:50,280
related to the area with if the behavior

896
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:52,890
change for the support they bipolar

897
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:57,540
patient and i connotation is a difficult

898
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:59,670
class if they move from from the fashion

899
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:03,450
space in which they are suffering and

900
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:06,210
they need help to - state in which they

901
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:08,069
feel they are like not so the heat

902
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:08,520
result they will not use the system

903
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:10,020
anymore

904
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:13,110
the challenge is

905
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:16,290
if we this system can be used by a

906
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:20,820
classification that is in any case

907
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:23,730
stable enough is not going to - I am too

908
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:27,900
or too low and if they train themselves

909
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:31,410
to recognize when something is wrong and

910
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:34,080
to take some action before too late

911
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:36,810
basically this is all I mean is there

912
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:39,540
way the biofeedback so if you want if

913
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:43,980
you learn to understand when there is

914
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:48,210
some problem before is to make this will

915
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:51,210
give you an added value - and then we

916
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:53,000
convince you to new facility so if you

917
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:55,950
have time for one more question

918
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,720
sorry about that oh thank you for coming

919
00:53:55,950 --> 00:54:00,810
on from all the way from Italy to here

920
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:02,700
it's obvious very important work you're

921
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:05,250
doing but I have a kind of a practical

922
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:08,970
question on you mentioned the fabric

923
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:11,490
embedded with silver particles would you

924
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:14,640
speak briefly on the durability of that

925
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:19,529
fabric I mean do you worship and yellow

926
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:21,930
light or what the ethical basically as I

927
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:24,480
have plain Instructables but then any

928
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:28,649
worker trying to keep all the property

929
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:31,830
of the textile material and so the

930
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:34,890
system is washable and is durable the

931
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:39,869
the only problem can come from the

932
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:44,069
elasticity so basically the said is a

933
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:47,640
weak point is the elastic so if we don't

934
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:50,580
wash with too high temperature it will

935
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:55,350
reduce the elasticity and will be less

936
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:59,340
performant but the data I have system

937
00:54:55,350 --> 00:55:02,609
deserve more kinga in five years more so

938
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:07,140
it is known I mean this is what a male

939
00:55:02,609 --> 00:55:10,830
the first problem that we face and after

940
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:14,160
and this is will be and something there

941
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:18,630
so also we will face because in the

942
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,850
future we plan to to put some hardware

943
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:25,820
piece in the

944
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:28,190
public and so we have to see the system

945
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:31,100
er they are we're in a way that is

946
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:32,990
really the distance devotion thank you

947
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:36,290
we do have time for one more if it's

948
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:38,810
quick and super I just had a question

949
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:40,370
about whether or not these types of

950
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:42,680
smart fabrics are going to be available

951
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:46,040
for the public to play with for kind of

952
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:50,419
DIY hacking and if y'all have a plan for

953
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:53,360
for that consumer level last note so do

954
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:57,800
we just le and I think there are there

955
00:55:53,360 --> 00:56:01,490
are also some some system around the

956
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:03,980
basically Hardy birthday or something

957
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:06,529
like doing something and they have

958
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:11,030
identified concerns to what they show

959
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:14,960
you that basically this the material is

960
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:18,800
what I've shown with the feeler and and

961
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:20,780
so they are already so people can

962
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:24,620
actually get the hardware to make their

963
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:29,290
own systems with you okay all right ray

964
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:29,290
well thank you very much wonderful
