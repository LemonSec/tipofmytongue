00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:33,070
panel which I am on and it's not my

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,590
problem anymore but I am very excited to

10
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:38,350
be talking with rich and Neil about

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:52,120
cyborg pride come on out and let's give

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:55,390
everyone a hand hi welcome to the panel

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,760
on cyborg pride and identity and I'm

14
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:01,120
rich MacKinnon and I'm the founder and

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:05,050
executive director of Borg Fest which is

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,780
a festival for cyborgs and you'll have

17
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:11,380
met Neil before he did the keynote on

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:14,110
Saturday and he is the founder of the

19
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,830
cyborg foundation among many other

20
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:19,450
things but I'm gonna call that

21
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,390
particular title out because cyborg

22
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,880
foundation is this was established to

23
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,380
fight for the rights for cyborgs which i

24
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,500
think is very germane to the today's

25
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,259
talk and again he does way more than

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,670
that but that's what is relevant right

27
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,860
now and then

28
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,049
Quinn Norton has been our fabulous

29
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,390
master of ceremonies the whole weekend

30
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:42,520
and is this that the first panel you're

31
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:45,820
actually serving on yes yes that's right

32
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:49,539
all right so Quinn has a deep background

33
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:52,898
in body hacking and maybe did you coin

34
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,490
the term or is that I did I think it was

35
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:56,680
it was generated by a few people

36
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,048
independently yeah but yes I coined the

37
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,700
term in response to the life hacking

38
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:03,009
movement awesome

39
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:06,399
and you also have an academic background

40
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:08,850
in human identity which is perfectly

41
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,170
suited for today's conversation right

42
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,690
looking forward to it awesome all right

43
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:18,170
well let's kind of get started on you

44
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:21,590
know why what is I word pride

45
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,958
and and how does it relate to other

46
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,420
kinds of pride that for we are familiar

47
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,120
with and I'll start off with you Quinn

48
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,130
why don't you kind of chime in on what

49
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,349
do you think cyborg pride it is and how

50
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,350
it relates to other kinds of pride so

51
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:38,149
the concept of a cyborg is one that I've

52
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:41,180
spent a lot of time thinking about and

53
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,400
probably use more widely than most

54
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:47,120
people for me

55
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:51,290
cyborg pride is about having agency over

56
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,950
your identity and using technology in a

57
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:56,870
way that assists that agency right now I

58
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:01,250
would say I think the biggest cyborg

59
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:03,140
pride issue going in the world is access

60
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,780
to birth control women's access to

61
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:09,140
women's health issues and a lot of

62
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:12,200
people don't think of that as a cyborg

63
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:15,500
Ian issue but it's profoundly cyborg and

64
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,959
for me to have control over fertility

65
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:22,090
that nature didn't give me and I've

66
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:26,410
decided to take and very few

67
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:29,480
technologies at all have done more to

68
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:32,570
revolutionize the world as women's birth

69
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,130
control has done and we're all kind of

70
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,959
trying to live in that post birth

71
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,989
control world now and understand what

72
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,700
that means and sometimes in that we kind

73
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:42,290
of lose sight it's become a baseline

74
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,078
issue one of the things identified very

75
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,510
early on in my research is that we think

76
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:50,150
of things as cyborgs and out there until

77
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:53,328
a certain point of acceptance when they

78
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:55,130
just become normal you know it used to

79
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:57,680
be the dying of childhood illnesses as

80
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:00,049
normal now vaccination is kind of

81
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,510
considered a human right to most people

82
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:05,120
well that's not normal that's not

83
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,739
nature's baseline nature's baseline is

84
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,609
you have lots of kids you have six kids

85
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:12,049
in hopes of keeping three and I would

86
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:14,060
much rather not live in nature's

87
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:15,709
baseline I like to say I'm 42 and I have

88
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:20,200
all my teeth and that's not natural but

89
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:24,289
I'm going with it and and similarly

90
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:26,770
having that control over my identity

91
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:28,979
that comes out of getting to say when

92
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:32,650
and a human being comes out of my vagina

93
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:35,039
is one of the most fundamental cyborg

94
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:38,080
rights issues there is or there could be

95
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:39,729
I think there's a lot more after that

96
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,090
there's a lot more let's back it up

97
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:44,440
there all right no it's great because I

98
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,299
think Neil and I based on earlier

99
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,069
conversations completely are on the same

100
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,720
page there but I'm not sure if everybody

101
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:52,630
in the room necessarily gets the

102
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,520
connection between cyborgs rights and a

103
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,590
woman a woman's right to choose over own

104
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,080
health issues so can you kind of spell

105
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,150
that out a little bit more I think it

106
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,568
comes back to that discussion of agency

107
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:07,479
it's using technology to make myself

108
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:09,729
into the person I want to be and wanting

109
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:13,270
to be proud of that one of the reasons I

110
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:14,800
love the word pride there is because in

111
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,169
much of the world and through much of

112
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,699
time a woman who wants control over sex

113
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:24,219
is a or harlot or something else

114
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:26,650
that's horrible I don't want to be

115
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,330
horrible I want that power and I want

116
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,929
that agency and I'm gonna get that

117
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:34,030
through chemical mechanical

118
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,139
technological means I've had several

119
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,840
different forms of birth control

120
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:39,789
inserted into me and I can't think of

121
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,650
what would be more cyborg in than that

122
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:44,199
it's an implant in that in essence right

123
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:47,650
okay so a cyborg then at least

124
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:49,000
philosophically is a human being whether

125
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,270
we can have animal cyborgs but we'll

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,240
save human a human being who is deciding

127
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:57,549
to take control of their body and

128
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:02,050
control their processes or their

129
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:04,240
fertility processes their birth we'll

130
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,729
just look at fertility processes and

131
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,099
using any technologies necessary to

132
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:10,780
control the processes I think one of the

133
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:13,719
interesting things you put in there that

134
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:19,479
I want to like push back and complicate

135
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:21,490
good is who decides because we also are

136
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,740
often subject to policies that you could

137
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,120
say make people into cyborgs perfect

138
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,130
which they may or may not be willing to

139
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,270
do no you're right I agree

140
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:33,610
I stipulate that point counselor okay

141
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:37,930
so Neil why don't you chime in a little

142
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:40,300
bit on cyborg pride are you proud to be

143
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,090
a cyborg are you a cyborg

144
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:47,139
yes I feel cyborg but I guess it's more

145
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:48,849
of as we've mentioned control of the

146
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,380
body through technology but in my case

147
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:54,370
it's more the control of the mind so

148
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:56,349
it's more how we can use technology to

149
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,060
extend our perception of reality or to

150
00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:01,509
modify our mind of how technology can

151
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:03,699
can modify our brains in a way and you

152
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:05,919
know we that's the way I feel cyborg

153
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:08,560
it's more of a psychological thing

154
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,630
around I mean physically or biologically

155
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,030
there is cybernetics in my body but

156
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,530
actually what really affected me was the

157
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,270
union between the software and the brain

158
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,880
that created this new sense or

159
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,948
perception extension so I guess we'll

160
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,630
see that there's different types of

161
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:25,139
people identifying as I work for

162
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:28,599
different reasons one might be more of a

163
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:30,159
for biological reasons others might be

164
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:32,740
more psychological and others might

165
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:34,479
might be more neurological even yeah

166
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,970
that was actually part of your talk

167
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,900
those three reasons right yes I think

168
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:42,370
[Music]

169
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,320
now do you think it's possible that

170
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,870
someone for example could become a

171
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,870
cyborg for psychological reasons like

172
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:52,870
you said but at the same time reject the

173
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:54,370
notion of a cyborg identity yes okay so

174
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,630
talk about that a little bit because I

175
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:59,020
asked you if you are proud to be a

176
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:01,960
cyborg does that mean that you are

177
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:05,349
unified neurologically physically and

178
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,508
psychologically and also accept the

179
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:09,639
cyborg identity yes so there's in my

180
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:11,650
case yes but I've met many people that

181
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,440
are biological ciphers but do not

182
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,330
identify themselves as ciphers or people

183
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,400
that have no cyber net is no

184
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,169
intervention of cybernetics in their

185
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,460
body but they identify themselves as

186
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:26,258
cyborgs so this different situation

187
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,750
against them we find more and more

188
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:30,610
emails from children emailing us saying

189
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,919
that they identify themselves as side

190
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,450
works and that their body does not

191
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:36,760
correspond to that that's why they want

192
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:39,250
implants to extend their perception or

193
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,799
the one new senses in their body because

194
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,570
they feel that they are cyborgs yet

195
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:46,290
that's why they need surgery to have

196
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:49,089
these new so let's talk about that so

197
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:52,360
apparently children will find Neil's

198
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:56,589
work on line and then write to him

199
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:59,290
and they're expressing their I guess

200
00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:02,550
their their sadness that they are not

201
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,420
cyborgs is that right yeah maybe not

202
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,370
particularly they see my work but they

203
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,410
they I guess they they've grown up

204
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,180
surrounded by technology they feel the

205
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,790
technology is such a part of their lives

206
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,010
and their mind that they feel that they

207
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,199
should they should be technology not use

208
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,819
it or wear it but actually be technology

209
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,410
and they feel that their body does not

210
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,839
have the technology that it should have

211
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:25,140
so that's the kind of feeling that

212
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:27,430
there's more and more amount of

213
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,439
teenagers and children emailing us about

214
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:32,969
this subject that they feel cyborg and

215
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,829
that that's why they want to have

216
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,810
cybernetics or electronics in their body

217
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:44,229
so once you follow this that's pretty

218
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:46,510
fascinating children many people is that

219
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:51,010
there is a kind of fetish for breaking

220
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:52,720
the skin I there's I'm you know I think

221
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:55,240
there's a really good argument to be

222
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,279
made that anyone with a cell phone and

223
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,140
the capacity to use it has really

224
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,579
crossed the line between being just a

225
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:07,060
human and a machine to being a human

226
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:09,819
machine system and that fetish for

227
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:12,849
breaking the skin I think is a lot about

228
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:15,160
separation from other people like trying

229
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:17,920
to cross a line for identity and you see

230
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:21,610
that in a lot of identity markers and

231
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:26,019
it's also I think a way people want to

232
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:27,610
convey commitment I think I'm not saying

233
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:30,040
a fetish to break the skin is good or

234
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:32,019
bad but that a lot of it is about saying

235
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,569
I just want to show the world that I'm

236
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:36,519
willing to go far I'm willing to commit

237
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:40,540
and breaking the skin is a way of

238
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:42,990
committing it going back to the kind of

239
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:46,719
smartphone example you know we do see

240
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:49,120
these changes have it become changes of

241
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,500
mind become psychological cyborg anism

242
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,180
as well as physical on all sorts of

243
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,370
levels positive and negative of course

244
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,989
this is this is like all you know Kranz

245
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:03,010
words technology technology is neither

246
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:05,740
good nor bad nor is it neutral I think

247
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:10,000
that point about really wanting to kind

248
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:12,700
of become more of a cyborg and that and

249
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,390
going back to the point of pride is that

250
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:18,670
feeling of not having rights not being

251
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:20,380
well represented I mean I've done a lot

252
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,089
of work in the queer community and one

253
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,370
of the reasons we focus on pride in the

254
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:27,130
queer community is because we're trying

255
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,950
to counter a really negative story

256
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:32,410
that's told about us I mean if you're

257
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:34,840
normal in a way you don't need pride I

258
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:38,469
mean that's you know I'm stretching the

259
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:42,360
room there but but pride is a way of

260
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,360
pushing back on on the negatives and

261
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,470
that kind of gets into some really

262
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,099
interesting questions about where we're

263
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:53,110
getting the idea of authentic humans

264
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,090
which I think we end up tangling up with

265
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,280
really fast here and possibly those kids

266
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,020
are ten going up with two so what what

267
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,079
can cyborgs learn from the queer

268
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:06,310
community I think a lot yeah yeah what

269
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:08,860
are some of those things a lot more I

270
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:11,170
think about I think we're communities

271
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:14,560
done a really good job of learning about

272
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:16,360
self-care and prioritizing self-care in

273
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,939
a way that I haven't seen as much in the

274
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,730
body hacker community and really like

275
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,920
there is there is a dynamic in the queer

276
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:26,380
community of go to the extremes and

277
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,719
prove that you belong and it can get

278
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,520
really toxic but the recognition of that

279
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,900
over the years has created kind of

280
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,990
support systems where people are like

281
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:38,350
you're queer you don't have to prove it

282
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:41,110
you know just be yourself you don't have

283
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:45,310
to do self-harm activities to be queer

284
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:49,360
enough and I do think that there's a lot

285
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:51,819
more egging on in the cyborg identified

286
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,250
communities and less self-care and they

287
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,290
could learn that I think from from the

288
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,990
queer movements right you know have you

289
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:01,780
ever been to a gay pride parade yes yeah

290
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:07,140
so do you think that cyborgs will

291
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:07,140
someday have a cyborg pride parade yes

292
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:19,500
who would go to a sideboard Pride Parade

293
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:22,259
Wow okay we'll meet you here in a year

294
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,120
all right yeah I think there's many

295
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:27,269
parallel isms also with the bioethics

296
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,689
committees that we face now with cyborg

297
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:33,060
surgeries that the reasons why

298
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:34,709
bioethical committees say no are there

299
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,079
is a parallelism with transgender

300
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:39,599
surgeries in the 50s and 60s why they

301
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:41,399
would say no as well in the they say

302
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,870
that's not necessary for exam in my case

303
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,899
they said it was not necessary to

304
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,310
perceive ultraviolet and infrared in

305
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:50,430
some cases they would say it was not

306
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:52,829
necessary to change gender also it says

307
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,930
they said they were worried about the

308
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:56,670
possible dangers of having this inside

309
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:59,519
the head or doing the surgery was a bit

310
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,529
they would they were worried about the

311
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,180
unknown and also they were worried about

312
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:04,529
the image the hospital would have if

313
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,819
someone would come out with an antenna

314
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:07,740
sticking out of their have in the same

315
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:10,319
way that back then they would think that

316
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,819
what would people think if a man came in

317
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:13,500
and came out as a woman or the other way

318
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:18,089
around and about the image of the

319
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:20,490
hospital as well so we closed closed

320
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:24,389
pearl parallelisms with the bioethical

321
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:28,589
committees yeah I I do think the other

322
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:30,660
side of that is that there's a lot less

323
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:32,879
emphasis appropriately on gender

324
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,649
reassignment surgery and trans identity

325
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,059
and that's really positive because

326
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:38,160
there's a lot of people who really don't

327
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:40,350
want it it's a very physically traumatic

328
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,790
process and there's a lot of people who

329
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,189
don't want to go through that and that

330
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,329
doesn't make them not trans that makes

331
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:47,399
them people who don't want to go through

332
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:49,290
an invasive surgery yes I think that's

333
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:53,250
an important point I and I don't know if

334
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:57,990
we've really established that the point

335
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:59,870
here so I'll say it it's my belief and I

336
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:03,540
believe I share this with y'all is that

337
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:08,430
transgendered people today embody

338
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:12,389
personally so many of the technologies

339
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:18,229
that we have to bear to make someone a

340
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:21,809
cyborg prosthetics implants transplants

341
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,240
cosmetic surgery a whole host of

342
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:26,230
pharmacy

343
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:29,700
critical support all of these things too

344
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:32,529
you have the agency to change their body

345
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:35,380
to better integrate with the identity

346
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:38,189
they have it's basically a full-body

347
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,600
process across the prosthetic

348
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:42,580
augmentation enhancement so that's a

349
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,410
transgendered person and and constructed

350
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,149
socially and also to give problems to

351
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,040
the tattoo community right which has

352
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:50,589
blazed a lot of ground there and also

353
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:54,430
blazed a lot of ground around pride and

354
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:56,500
legal issues dr. young Thompson's talk

355
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,779
was fantastic for looking at the

356
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:02,459
difficulties of working well a modified

357
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:04,870
person and that really does extend to

358
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:07,209
cyborgs and cyborgs identified people

359
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:08,620
that's right so that you know it's

360
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:11,410
interesting because you made two points

361
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,000
or almost at odds with each other

362
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,920
but I love that because it just shows

363
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,890
the the nuances of the conversation

364
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:21,490
earlier you're talking about almost like

365
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:24,399
communities of breaking the flesh right

366
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:27,779
and then we're talking about how

367
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,459
transgendered people today are not being

368
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:35,350
pressured to break the flesh that you

369
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:37,899
can be transferred to and I think that's

370
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,670
important to realize that you don't need

371
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:44,980
to necessarily break the flesh to be a

372
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:47,949
cyborg either right so like I came out

373
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:50,620
when I was thirty I I'm I'm gay and I'm

374
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:52,870
wondering like is there a coming-out

375
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:55,779
process for cyborgs there has to be

376
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,579
right like we talked or just a few

377
00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:00,459
minutes ago about some people who don't

378
00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:03,310
identify as cyborgs although we may

379
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:05,948
recognize them as such it's not for us

380
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:08,470
to say you're a cyborg whether you like

381
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:10,990
it or not do you think there is a

382
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,270
parallel with sort of coming out that

383
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:15,900
eventually they will recognize this or

384
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:18,689
is it different

385
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:21,429
really difficult question yeah because

386
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:24,010
it kind of depends on how you define

387
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:26,679
cyborg I mean if we start looking at

388
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:29,070
almost like a Kinzie style scale or the

389
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:31,750
like really complicated

390
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:35,010
multi-dimensional scale that's being

391
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,010
would have to be hexa desk

392
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:49,450
fifteen you know if I say having birth

393
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:51,820
control is a cyborg e'en mod then I am

394
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,470
saying billions of people who would not

395
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,290
necessarily accept the identity are

396
00:17:53,470 --> 00:18:00,040
cyborgs I am to some degree thrusting

397
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:01,210
that identity on them again I think we

398
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,570
can lift a little bit from queer culture

399
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:06,429
by saying you don't have to be you don't

400
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:08,050
have to self-identify as gay if you've

401
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:11,140
occasionally been attracted to the same

402
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:14,200
sex people you just be you know you with

403
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:16,090
that thing that is they're depending on

404
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:20,440
a lot of this just goes back to identity

405
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:22,330
formation so can people be modified and

406
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,360
not be cyborgs well we are modified we

407
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:28,300
we live in you know we live in 2016 and

408
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,010
we are really all of us seven and a half

409
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,010
billion it's right there in the number

410
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:36,520
wait wait for from you know the natural

411
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:39,520
position right there's no way you should

412
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,770
have this many people on our little blue

413
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,280
planet which kind of means we're all

414
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:48,639
cyborgs that's right okay so there are

415
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,740
people who identify a cyborg there are

416
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,030
people who may come out as cyborgs and

417
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,700
there are people who just flat out

418
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:56,170
reject the identity because it doesn't

419
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,860
suit them alright

420
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:06,700
but regardless of that sort of position

421
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:09,100
on this on this new Kinsey scale many of

422
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,190
them may experience discrimination as

423
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:17,770
cyborgs right and we can't underestimate

424
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:23,860
that I mean look at how quickly Google

425
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:26,350
glass was rejected right I don't think

426
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:31,120
it's a stretch to think that as more

427
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:33,159
people are visibly cyborgs that that

428
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,600
there can be a similar backlash like

429
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,300
Neal has felt some of it people think

430
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,639
he's recording right so as more people

431
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,530
show up and people are afraid and they

432
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,630
don't understand they may get thrown out

433
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,299
of bars all the same things that you saw

434
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:48,159
with Google glass so you know you know

435
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:51,099
can you talk about some of the stories

436
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:53,139
you've heard about cyborg discrimination

437
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:55,599
or even violence against cyborgs through

438
00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:57,699
the side work foundation yeah but it's

439
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,799
most of these attacks have been not

440
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,080
because the person was united to

441
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,940
technology but because they thought they

442
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,708
were filming so it's always I think all

443
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:10,239
that the attacks I've heard about are

444
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:12,039
always related to privacy and most of

445
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:14,080
the ciphers have nothing to do with I

446
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:16,269
mean there's nothing to do with filming

447
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,589
or recording and in mic is the only

448
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:19,779
times I've been attacked was because

449
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:23,708
people thought I was also recording or

450
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:25,809
filming so it's it's a misunderstanding

451
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:27,879
that people think that cameras only are

452
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:32,289
used to film but you can use cameras as

453
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:34,958
a sensor instead so it's I think this is

454
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:37,929
something that we can't really avoid

455
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:40,809
unless you put it right so just like

456
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:43,690
like a feminine gay men maybe more of a

457
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:44,440
target because of the way they appear to

458
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,079
the public

459
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:50,799
cyborgs who have who I make the

460
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:57,899
appearance of recording may be more of a

461
00:20:50,799 --> 00:21:01,269
target in this community there because

462
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:03,369
we don't want you know nobody wants to

463
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:05,200
have their agency taken away and the

464
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:07,029
thought of being recorded by somebody

465
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,619
who's that's part of their identity

466
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:14,829
marker you know it has to end at you

467
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:17,320
like if your modification is somehow

468
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:19,779
impacting someone else's life they have

469
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,408
a right to have a say in that and and

470
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:24,940
yeah I can see why walking into a bar

471
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:26,649
with a recording device in people's

472
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:30,399
faces that's not a place where they're

473
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:31,748
feeling comfortable with that it is an

474
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:33,488
interesting thing how do you if it's not

475
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:36,759
a recording device how do you signal

476
00:21:33,489 --> 00:21:39,670
that and I think this is a communication

477
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:42,790
problem at that point

478
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:44,260
and it's a serious problem especially

479
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:46,149
when you're looking at lots of different

480
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,920
augmentation coming in and the other

481
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,510
serious problem I want to just step

482
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,540
right up to there is the things that

483
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:54,220
don't look like recording but are right

484
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,260
in the middle of a societal debate over

485
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,480
surveillance and I think it's

486
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:01,540
appropriate to ask you know what are my

487
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,040
rights to not be recorded and how are

488
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,320
those gonna be respected because right

489
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,180
now the most normal looking dude can be

490
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,820
covered in hidden cameras walk up follow

491
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,440
me around put all the stocking material

492
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,550
they want to out to millions of people

493
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,570
on the internet that would be called

494
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:30,040
human acting they're concealing their

495
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:32,169
cyborg ISM your your walling off human

496
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,450
from cyborg there and I'm not sure

497
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:36,220
that's a that's a duality it's not a

498
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:39,280
duality but I was trying I was trying to

499
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:43,870
go like there they are there they're

500
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:46,420
doing similar to like they are recording

501
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:48,760
in that way but because they're trying

502
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,830
to hide the recording then people don't

503
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,990
really know that there are cyborgs who

504
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,000
are recording so it's it's an

505
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:57,340
assimilating or mainstreaming and that's

506
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,770
what I meant by I actually don't feel

507
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:02,290
human if I don't like being defined as a

508
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:05,740
human because it kind of separates me

509
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:07,420
from animals and if I if I define myself

510
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,730
as animal it kind of separates me from

511
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:12,880
organism so I feel much more comfortable

512
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:15,100
defining myself as an organism and in my

513
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,140
case I'm a cybernetic organism so side

514
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,240
work for me feels that I'm in a wider

515
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,610
group where I'm in the same level as a

516
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,920
plant or an insect because we're all

517
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:27,070
organisms so I I do feel more

518
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:30,280
comfortable not being defined as a human

519
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:33,129
but I feel cyborg is actually in the

520
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,830
same level as an insect in a way I it's

521
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:38,260
funny like I feel exactly the opposite

522
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:40,330
but in a kind of like unsettled language

523
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,310
way like for me saying human I think of

524
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:45,220
a human as an animal and that kind of

525
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:47,800
makes me feel more bound to the natural

526
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:50,880
cycles than if I were to say I'm you

527
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:53,470
know organism well so animal in or

528
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,120
versus a technological process or an

529
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:58,320
algorithm something that's discrete what

530
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,250
the difference for me is that

531
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,929
technological processes are often

532
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:04,330
incredibly discrete and incredibly

533
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:06,250
deterministic and I live in a

534
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:08,169
non-deterministic natural world so for

535
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:11,020
me the language that brings me back to

536
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:13,090
organism is human because it describes

537
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:36,900
the non-deterministic world I feel part

538
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:39,010
of and our technology is algorithmic

539
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,710
with nature you put it in the same room

540
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:46,930
but who knows what's gonna come out and

541
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:50,680
that's what I feel more part of all

542
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:53,650
right so let's talk a little bit about

543
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,210
cyborgs rights okay what what are

544
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:59,590
cyborgs rights what are what are the

545
00:24:55,210 --> 00:25:01,600
rights that you kind of mapped out it's

546
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:03,899
just basically having the same rights as

547
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,730
anyone else so not having discrimination

548
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,770
also though I think the right that we're

549
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:12,100
really focusing on is the right to have

550
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:14,740
surgery because there's lots of bicycle

551
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,270
committees not accepting the fact that

552
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,180
people want to extend their perception

553
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:20,980
of reality so extending our senses is

554
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,810
something not ethical for many by

555
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,820
ethical committees and it needs to be

556
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:27,040
address address the same so that's one

557
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,230
of the rights we think we should have

558
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,360
also having cyborg clinics or clinics

559
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:34,090
that specialize in cyber surgeries

560
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,679
because now at the moment software

561
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:37,480
developers are somewhere doctors are

562
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,630
somewhere else psychologists but if we

563
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,820
are united in one space and we have the

564
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:45,970
right to have this cyborg surgery space

565
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,770
then we would be able to work better and

566
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,710
in a way this is still not happening

567
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:52,930
okay and you you said you you you view

568
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:55,000
this augmentation as part of your body

569
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:57,250
that it's an organ yes

570
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,710
and I think I've heard you say in other

571
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:02,950
venues that because it's an organ you

572
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:03,750
feel that we should start to rethink of

573
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,310
the way

574
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:10,030
of the cost associated like we're not

575
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:11,710
currently allowed to buy organs pay for

576
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:13,750
the procedure but the organ itself is

577
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:16,750
free and so can you talk a little bit

578
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:20,590
more about like that augmentation should

579
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:23,320
be free like an organ yes I think it

580
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:26,290
should it you shouldn't look at this as

581
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:30,939
a device or a gadget or an electronic

582
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:33,730
element it's an organ that is a should

583
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:36,700
be treated like any other organ so we

584
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:38,560
the ones that we develop we actually

585
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,480
encourage people to develop their own

586
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:43,960
organs so we explain how you can make

587
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,640
the organ and then what you need the

588
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:49,030
only cause really is having it

589
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:51,940
surgically implanted in this case which

590
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:53,649
is well in my case it was that's the

591
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,300
surgeon didn't actually want to get paid

592
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,280
for the surgery but I had to pay for the

593
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,600
hole

594
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:03,100
renting the room and hiding it from

595
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:05,110
being known basically and Brian I think

596
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:08,889
I think that kind of thinking is very

597
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:12,850
important in establishing the framework

598
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:16,660
so that someday if someone pulls on that

599
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:18,100
and Yanks it that that becomes we

600
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,530
consider that as I salt against your

601
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:25,120
body and not property damage yeah that

602
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:27,280
was I filed I was attacked by 2011 it

603
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,479
was filed as a physical aggression they

604
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,800
broke the tip of my antenna so this is

605
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,660
breaking a part of my body it's not

606
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,590
something external

607
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:40,120
I actually really want to reinforce what

608
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,750
you said you know when I got a magnet

609
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:47,439
implanted the only way we could do it is

610
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:50,050
without anesthetic so I put my finger in

611
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,140
some ice water for a while and then it

612
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:54,879
was cut open without any anesthesia the

613
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,800
first incision was too narrow so it had

614
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,980
to be expanded and then it had to be

615
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,870
sutured up at the end and the only thing

616
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:05,380
I was allowed to do there was sit still

617
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:08,669
grin and bear it and when I had the

618
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:11,340
magnet taken out by a doctor

619
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:14,400
you know a healing surgery I had

620
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,600
although they were like gonna hang up a

621
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,900
curtain between me and my finger so I

622
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,969
didn't even have to look at it and it's

623
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:24,150
a really hypocritical process at that

624
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:26,130
point you can't with these modifications

625
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:29,550
that are non-medical have an aesthetic

626
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:31,200
right well that that that brings up a

627
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:34,050
whole new topic which is sort of the

628
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:38,850
dark world of cyborg surgery and cyborg

629
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:40,860
medicine right and so you know it really

630
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:43,709
surprised me when I first heard about

631
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:46,260
what you needed to go through in

632
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:48,240
collaboration with a doctor to have this

633
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,440
done and that there was some risk for

634
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,770
the doctor what could you tell them a

635
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:55,620
little bit about that story about the

636
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:59,100
doctor like what were his conditions

637
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:00,929
were doing this procedure well first I

638
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,120
presented the surgery to bioethical

639
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:05,520
committee and they said no after some

640
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,620
months and then from that meeting I

641
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,660
someone introduced me to a doctor that

642
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,060
said he was willing to do the surgery as

643
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:14,340
long as it all remained anonymous

644
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:16,050
so and he was willing to do it for free

645
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,209
so I would only have to pay for the

646
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:22,020
material and renting a space and then

647
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:23,820
not his normal space no it was so we

648
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,830
rented the room in a clinic but the

649
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,300
clinic doesn't know what happened didn't

650
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,780
know what was happening then in secrecy

651
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:36,690
yes we didn't even have a charity of

652
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:38,610
what does this remind you of abortions

653
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:49,110
early abortions is what it reminded me

654
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:51,449
of that's right so the the overlaps with

655
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:53,040
with women's health issues like you

656
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:55,980
mentioned and transgender which side

657
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:58,200
were continue to come back yeah and not

658
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,660
just abortions but also access to birth

659
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,000
control which was illegal even in this

660
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:06,090
country into the not-too-distant past

661
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,870
and there was some really dodgy things

662
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:10,439
that happened

663
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:13,830
and people got very hurt right so just

664
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,990
then as a now we need to find friends in

665
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:18,990
the medical community who are willing to

666
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:21,260
help us but on their terms that protect

667
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:24,120
them within their professional circles

668
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:27,030
and we need to educate the medical

669
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:30,449
community about the ways in which this

670
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:32,100
is normal and beneficial and that's also

671
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,150
a process again you can pull from the

672
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,620
queer community in the trans community

673
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:37,050
where they're they're doing this

674
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:41,939
education of medical professionals to

675
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:46,320
say this is OK for us and you need to

676
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:48,059
catch up with us and I one of the things

677
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,070
I think we desperately need around

678
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:52,440
modifications you're starting to see it

679
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:55,020
with tattooing a little bit is some long

680
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,970
term academic studies of outcomes as it

681
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,920
wasn't until there was more studies of

682
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:02,160
say trans surgery outcomes from like oh

683
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,720
this is actually a good idea it's really

684
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,900
helping these people and their self

685
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,780
reporting in really really broad numbers

686
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:12,840
that this saved their lives and I don't

687
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:14,910
think all cyborgs in modifications go to

688
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,040
that level I'm sure some do and some do

689
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:18,929
not but it shouldn't have to be about

690
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,040
life or death for you to get something

691
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:21,840
that's going to make your life better

692
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,360
it's not the question if you want an

693
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,059
iPhone 6 it shouldn't be the question if

694
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:31,110
you want a new sense so I'm a big

695
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:33,870
believer in full participation right so

696
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:36,209
there's about 15 minutes left actually

697
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:38,159
and I'd love to be able to incorporate

698
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:41,130
more of you all in the conversation if

699
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:43,110
you have some thoughts and Quinn can be

700
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:45,030
a Phil Donahue here where the microphone

701
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:50,309
is dick Oh perfect yeah let's see what

702
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:51,990
you have to say so you said about birth

703
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,940
control triggered something in me

704
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:56,160
because recently I got my fallopian

705
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,780
tubes removed as it means the birth

706
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,230
control sterilization and so I had never

707
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:01,678
until that moment thought of that as a

708
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:03,840
cyborg and

709
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,250
act like just removing something I

710
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,080
always

711
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:08,960
about it as something that you know

712
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,908
you're adding something your but really

713
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,419
it's just about augmentation and that

714
00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:15,980
another thought the course has become an

715
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:18,500
adult and gotten more body modifications

716
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,909
I've always thought about like what's

717
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,710
the thing that's gonna really freak me

718
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:23,360
out about body modifications when I'm

719
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:26,390
like old like what's the thing I'm like

720
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,340
why would you do that to yourself and at

721
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:29,900
one point I thought yeah when people

722
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:32,899
just start chopping off limbs just

723
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:34,490
because maybe that'll be the thing where

724
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:37,100
I like draw the line but how like a

725
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:39,260
friend Charlie who wants to chop his bum

726
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:42,830
foot off because you know he'd rather

727
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:44,990
get an implant and so it's not really a

728
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:49,340
question it's just more of a topic of

729
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:52,309
like the idea of removing things as a

730
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:57,709
cyborg an augmentation act rather than

731
00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:59,178
you know in addition so anybody i I do

732
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:01,010
have one thing I really want to say

733
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:05,090
about that and and it's a little bit

734
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:07,429
about how our perceptions of our bodies

735
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:09,740
follows our technology which is my

736
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:11,900
grandfather had something removed he had

737
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:15,289
his appendix removed when he was 11 and

738
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,850
there was no antibiotic available so

739
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:18,980
they kept the wound open for six weeks

740
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:23,209
continuously flushing it with saline and

741
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:26,299
the doctor said I've performed this

742
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:28,850
surgery successfully over 20 times but

743
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:30,799
none of my patients have lived when he

744
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:32,530
was coming in with it and if you just

745
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,510
think about that for a moment

746
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:37,010
this little 11 year old kid and of

747
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,650
course the reason was because we're

748
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:42,080
doing an abdominal cut like that prior

749
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:43,940
to antibiotics even if you completely

750
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,340
were successful removing all the

751
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,440
antibiotics pretty soon they'd get a

752
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:50,299
massive infection throughout their body

753
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,299
and be just as likely it's not to die

754
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:55,490
except to see me in a few weeks so to

755
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:57,830
some degree our perception of our rights

756
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:01,909
around this is predicated on a world of

757
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:04,490
antibiotics and our perception of what's

758
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:06,049
a good idea is to some degree always

759
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:07,190
predicated on the technologies that are

760
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:10,639
available to me I think absolutely

761
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:13,520
having something removed is is kind of a

762
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,830
cyborg an thing I think it can get

763
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,770
really complicated when it kind of

764
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:21,529
overlaps with mental health illness

765
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:23,090
issues there are people who kind of you

766
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,800
have to look at the motivations for

767
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:26,330
modifications to some degree in the

768
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,429
medical community but I actually think

769
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,560
that's just as true of plastic surgery

770
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:32,450
where there is no psych review and I

771
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,549
think that's a terrible mistake people

772
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:36,439
are making and that's plastic surgery

773
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:38,570
just as dangerous as any of the stuff we

774
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,790
want to do when it comes to medical

775
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,840
complications and infection so there is

776
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:43,310
a double standard there and I think

777
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:53,090
that's something that we can kind of

778
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:55,699
latch on to to educate that's good so

779
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:57,620
you discussed that when you had your

780
00:34:55,699 --> 00:35:00,230
surgery done that you had to do it in

781
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:03,020
secret since then have you run into more

782
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,790
and more doctors that are that say that

783
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,800
they would have facilitated it actually

784
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:08,270
in the public eye and not remain

785
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,980
anonymous and such like that it's been

786
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,570
more acceptable since now that it's been

787
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,820
done that you've run into more and more

788
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:16,910
medical you know practitioners that will

789
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:18,500
actually accept them we do that or do

790
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:21,170
know we've received many emails from

791
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:23,870
doctors willing to so willing to do

792
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:25,520
surgeries but not publicly no not

793
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:27,410
publicly at all no no but because it's

794
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,450
on the fringe side of things and they're

795
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:32,060
you know scared to have there if there's

796
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:32,960
anything goes wrong yes so but you

797
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,460
haven't had you haven't had any

798
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,080
practitioners come out and say openly

799
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,210
that they would just do this in the open

800
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,279
eye and well we're talking with Japanese

801
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:42,260
the bioethical Committee from Japan and

802
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,570
they're open minded with actually

803
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:47,030
accepting many many surgeries but it's

804
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:48,830
still a tux so it's it's more of not

805
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:51,440
just their image but the community

806
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:56,930
around them that's that might shun them

807
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:58,310
yes we out of the field yes my ethical

808
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:01,250
comment this is very complex if there's

809
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:03,230
14 doctors 13 say yes but one says no

810
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:05,660
it's not gonna happen so it that's the

811
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:08,720
main problem that there's always one or

812
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:11,270
two or three that but they're just

813
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,819
afraid that the community or yeah the

814
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:15,740
license at large might be lost yes or

815
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:17,300
they simply don't see it necessary and

816
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,220
which is something that I don't

817
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,110
understand why I mean sensing for

818
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:23,480
example ultraviolet could save lives if

819
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:25,790
we could sense ultraviolet we would be

820
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,530
more protective whenever we sensed that

821
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:30,900
or sensing what's behind us could also

822
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:33,720
allow us to have more protection night

823
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,280
vision would also save so much energy we

824
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,439
wouldn't have all these artificial light

825
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,990
here if we all had night vision cities

826
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,790
would be dark the energy we wouldn't be

827
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:45,240
wasting so much energy the earth would

828
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:47,029
feel better so many senses that now

829
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,220
doctors don't see as necessary

830
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:51,600
we hope that in in the near future

831
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,669
they'll start seeing it as actually

832
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,020
necessary so you not seen you haven't

833
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,900
seen much of a change in the

834
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:00,150
practitioners or panel yes I haven't yes

835
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,970
just a little bit since it has been it's

836
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:05,880
in their face it's like yes they slowly

837
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:07,680
I feel it slowly it's picking up steam

838
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,850
so actually like more and more except

839
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,620
that the more and more its out there in

840
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:14,940
front yes and in some countries more

841
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:16,830
than others here like I just say that

842
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,510
quickly that one of the reasons why

843
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:20,460
we're dealing with those bioethics

844
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:22,440
committees is because medicine has a

845
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,240
very dark history and a lot of things

846
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,940
were done really awful things were done

847
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,399
to people without any agency and I think

848
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,780
it's hard for society to adapt to the

849
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,580
idea that there's a bunch of these

850
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,410
things that we're done unethically and

851
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,330
that that ethical landscape may have

852
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:38,279
changed and it's not necessarily

853
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:40,590
horrific medical experiments which is

854
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,200
this you know 19th early 20th century

855
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:52,950
medicine history that they're trying to

856
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:54,839
get away from any more questions I'm

857
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,700
interested kind of in the intersection

858
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,380
of like you make the point that that is

859
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,970
a part of your body and I know you've

860
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,250
had some fight with the government over

861
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:04,589
passports getting that recognized and

862
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:06,660
that way and I'm I'm interested in

863
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:09,420
general like when you travel through the

864
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:12,080
airport and whatnot like how how much

865
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:14,220
difficulty do you have getting

866
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,200
particularly state and government

867
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:18,299
organizations around the world I guess

868
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,129
to accept that that is like a physical

869
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:23,160
part of your body and not a gadget that

870
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:24,600
you're wearing well at the airport I

871
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,640
show the passport so then they say that

872
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:30,180
the official image has an antenna but

873
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,370
even though they check they just look at

874
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,779
the bag to check it they don't believe

875
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:36,270
me if I say that it's implants so they

876
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,920
have to look if it goes inside my head

877
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,990
or not and then they just ask lots of

878
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,760
lots lots of questions

879
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:44,640
it's like giving a whole conference at

880
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:48,660
airport security garden so it's I

881
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,460
usually go one hour ahead before the yes

882
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:53,819
yeah I want to ask you a question which

883
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:56,820
is how do children respond to it

884
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:59,280
they usually point at the antennas say

885
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:02,190
what it is I tell them and then they

886
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,050
suddenly accept it they SEC accepted it

887
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:06,930
and then they ask what the sound of

888
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,670
colors is or whatever and some children

889
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:11,040
just pointed they said they want one

890
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:12,990
without even knowing what it is and the

891
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,670
last time was children start to think

892
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:20,069
it's now it's a kind of the selfie stick

893
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:22,290
as well so it's it's a new type of but

894
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:23,849
yet children I've given touch to primary

895
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:26,640
schools as well and the questions they

896
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:28,770
ask are in the same level as any other

897
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,990
conference I give to adults they they

898
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:36,000
ask the same type of questions it's

899
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:39,569
surprising that they have the Q&A with

900
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,089
children or with adults is almost same

901
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:44,540
questions you know usually any more

902
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,540
questions

903
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:51,839
alright so you mentioned that you know

904
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:54,270
the children write to you and they have

905
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,400
cyborg questions but as an organization

906
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:59,220
you've decided that it's really

907
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,020
important on how you communicate about

908
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:04,410
these relatively controversial matters

909
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:07,920
with minors yes right so talk about that

910
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:09,540
a little bit like how what do you say

911
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,430
and what do you try to avoid saying

912
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,710
because they're minors I know there's

913
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:15,509
many different teenagers that write to

914
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:18,180
us because they are developing sensors

915
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:19,800
for machines and they say well I want I

916
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,940
don't want to create these sensors for

917
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,859
machines I wanted to create these

918
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:25,109
sensors for myself so could you help me

919
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:26,759
add these sensors to my body and then we

920
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:29,250
just need to tell them that they have to

921
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:32,070
wait until they are at least 18 it was

922
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:35,640
just in the u.s. I think it's 21 or 18

923
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:38,280
through I think yeah we won't interfere

924
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,839
with with families use it in the US I

925
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,269
mean it's not here you have

926
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:44,589
essentially the parent has to make all

927
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:49,169
sorts of legal decisions for the child

928
00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:52,269
until 1818 here yeah so 18 yeah and then

929
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:54,249
yes so I guess in the 20s will receive

930
00:40:52,269 --> 00:40:57,189
lots of emails from those teenagers that

931
00:40:54,249 --> 00:41:00,999
will be 18 in the 20s and there will be

932
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:03,430
a kind of book but our children savvy

933
00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:04,988
enough to work within their own

934
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:07,180
communities to mod themselves without

935
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:09,219
their parents giving consent they're

936
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:11,499
able to create the censors but then

937
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:13,539
cutting themselves and putting is that

938
00:41:11,499 --> 00:41:16,029
or actually drilling it this is

939
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:17,979
something that at least not that I know

940
00:41:16,029 --> 00:41:24,789
they're not doing it yet but they might

941
00:41:17,979 --> 00:41:27,359
actually generally where it starts yes

942
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:30,309
but there's also a whole bunch of

943
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,200
there's kind of a Sabrosa thing children

944
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:33,999
do with technology a lot where they're

945
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,890
doing things like they'll have photo

946
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:37,269
vaults that their parents can't see and

947
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:39,129
they'll have an online life that's

948
00:41:37,269 --> 00:41:41,769
illegible to their parents in a lot of

949
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:47,200
cases I have a I have a daughter she'll

950
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:48,779
be 13 in a week and I've studied

951
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,118
somewhat the behavior of kids around

952
00:41:48,779 --> 00:41:54,910
high-risk activities and also identity

953
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:57,910
formation and my own personal take on

954
00:41:54,910 --> 00:42:00,038
that was to just be willing to hear

955
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:04,930
anything because if I'm not I'm not

956
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:07,349
gonna hear anything so yeah I mean as

957
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:12,219
far as as far as that relationship goes

958
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:14,680
determined children are determined and I

959
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:16,390
think it's it's important to be in a

960
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,249
position to intercede because children

961
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:21,038
don't always make the right decisions

962
00:42:18,249 --> 00:42:23,200
for themselves and and to be able to

963
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:27,099
kind of get more knowledge into that

964
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:30,009
process which means be willing to hear

965
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:31,630
what you're going to hear because if

966
00:42:30,009 --> 00:42:34,269
they're just maybe in a peer group

967
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:36,759
trying to do something the chances of

968
00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:38,468
them not doing it go down if they're in

969
00:42:36,759 --> 00:42:40,509
a peer group and doing it safely may

970
00:42:38,469 --> 00:42:43,299
also go down if they have no input but a

971
00:42:40,509 --> 00:42:45,670
peer group so if they're gonna like

972
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:47,049
reinvent tattooing at home I would much

973
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,950
rather know that they're thinking of

974
00:42:47,049 --> 00:42:51,759
doing that but

975
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:55,960
later okay so kind of moving into

976
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:59,530
wrapping up mood and a plan for going

977
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:02,590
forward Neil what would you say would be

978
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:12,820
the biggest risk to the cyborg community

979
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:16,750
I think it's such a the the it's such an

980
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:19,300
Inc it's a personal decision to to

981
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:23,230
become a cyborg in my case it it's such

982
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:26,590
a I think I I can't really tell you I

983
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:29,800
mean each person should have I think

984
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:32,140
they should feel the freedom to decide

985
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:35,050
how they want to sense or perceive the

986
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:36,790
world or how they want the body to to be

987
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:39,070
and and then take the their own

988
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:41,860
decisions I think it's it's a such a

989
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:43,240
personal thing that I well I was

990
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,970
thinking more external because do you

991
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:51,939
remember when we met in London at Luke's

992
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:54,790
event right in the dark but I don't know

993
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:59,110
if you remember in the audience it

994
00:43:54,790 --> 00:44:02,020
seemed like a third of them identified

995
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:05,800
as Luddites that they had kind of like

996
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:07,720
invited themselves to the event and just

997
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,580
in the tone of their questions and

998
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,350
feedback

999
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:15,819
it just never occurred that there might

1000
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:17,650
be an organised pushback on things

1001
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,660
cyborg do you remember that the

1002
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:23,170
hostility from some of the people there

1003
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:26,109
and I'm wondering is that is that a risk

1004
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:28,270
that we're under estimating yeah well we

1005
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:29,890
have never let it still existed in other

1006
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:33,490
words and they were there a third of the

1007
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:37,120
room were there you know there's a we

1008
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:39,459
receive emails from extremely religious

1009
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:42,490
people that think that what we are doing

1010
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:46,540
in particular is against the will of God

1011
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:49,870
that modifying oneself is something that

1012
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:51,670
is against nature and against the will

1013
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:54,970
of God and and they are threatening it

1014
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:58,150
has because of that and that's the only

1015
00:44:54,970 --> 00:45:01,120
thing that really bothers me there's

1016
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:04,240
these people that do

1017
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:07,790
take it as something this is against

1018
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,799
religion so do you think that I know

1019
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:12,170
maybe leading the question here but I'm

1020
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,910
just I'm because you might not have

1021
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:15,970
thought about it as much before I'm

1022
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:18,319
trying to you know get your perspective

1023
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:20,980
you know based on that kind of the

1024
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:23,600
Luddite pushback we got in London and

1025
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:27,170
the religious related emails that you're

1026
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:29,509
getting do you perceive a risk in the

1027
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:33,080
form of politics that could come out of

1028
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:35,030
this that starts to clamp down on body

1029
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,310
mods I mean make it even more difficult

1030
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:39,470
forcing us to go even more underground

1031
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:43,000
do you see that as a risk or do you

1032
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:43,000
think Wilson have dodged that bullet I

1033
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:50,120
think I think in general it's getting

1034
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:52,700
more and more accepted to do this so I

1035
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:55,250
think this what we felt there it might

1036
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:58,399
slowly are we living a cyborg bubble

1037
00:45:55,250 --> 00:46:02,930
though right this is our little bubble

1038
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:04,610
maybe maybe or maybe I feel that in

1039
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:08,899
general maybe we are in a transition but

1040
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:10,940
but maybe it still we still the the

1041
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:15,230
actual people that modify themselves

1042
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:18,020
voluntarily with cybernetics is still a

1043
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:20,870
very small minority now but I think it's

1044
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:22,640
it's it's gonna happen in we are now in

1045
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:24,589
a transition where we already merged

1046
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,020
psychologically with technology and the

1047
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:29,720
next stages that will all accept merging

1048
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:31,009
biologically when you want to fall in

1049
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,629
this or tell us what you think is the

1050
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:34,700
biggest risk well we are sitting in a

1051
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:36,110
state right now which I like to point

1052
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:41,000
out has worse access to women's health

1053
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:53,750
in most of the Middle East and we have a

1054
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:56,450
cyborg governor with a lot of different

1055
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:58,970
answers it depends on what it is it

1056
00:46:56,450 --> 00:47:01,129
depends on where you are but also I

1057
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:03,379
don't necessarily think that external

1058
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:06,920
crackdown is the biggest danger to a

1059
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:08,690
cyborg community I think staying or

1060
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,250
fostering isolation from the other

1061
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:12,770
communities that have gone before and

1062
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:14,300
built tools and built legal action

1063
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:16,160
so on and so forth just kind of trying

1064
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:18,200
to be trying to stay in cyborg bubble

1065
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,609
and be special little creatures when

1066
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,740
we're surrounded by people who have

1067
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:24,050
worked on women's healthcare issues or

1068
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:26,540
have worked on trans issues and have

1069
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:28,750
blazed a lot of ground socially and

1070
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:31,220
legalistically that we can build on I

1071
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:33,020
think that's where I think I think more

1072
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:35,600
than anything we need to align ourselves

1073
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:37,790
with people who are interested in the

1074
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,290
same agency issues that are at heart

1075
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:41,440
whether you're trying to kind of

1076
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:44,029
integrate technology into your body or

1077
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,880
trying to claim rights to a trans

1078
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:49,370
identity right alright I think we're

1079
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,320
gonna we're gonna call it quits there so

1080
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:53,720
thank you for your attention and thank

1081
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:55,880
you for your your your participation

1082
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,799
today and we'll see you next year at the

1083
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:00,280
world's first International cyborg Pride

1084
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,280
Festival

1085
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:06,269
