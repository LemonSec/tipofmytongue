1
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:11,150
our first speaker today I'm very excited

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:15,110
about it's David you and Duncan he's the

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:17,060
author of when I'm 64 when I'm 164 sorry

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,070
I get that song stuck in my head the new

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,409
science of radical life extension and

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,020
what happens if it succeeds he also

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,849
wrote the experimental man one what one

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,570
man's body reveals about his future your

9
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:31,489
health and our toxic world today he's

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,960
gonna bring us a far ranging talk on new

11
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,280
medical and health technologies that are

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,500
already allowing us to push the

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,780
boundaries between sick and healthy to

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,269
potentially enhance humans and possibly

15
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,370
increase human life expectancy

16
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,020
what are these technologies what are the

17
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:49,099
implications good or bad if they work

18
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,820
and he is an author he's written for The

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,150
Daily Beast

20
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:55,940
the New York Times Wired and others and

21
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:58,460
this can talk of convergence on health

22
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,980
IT and bioscience I'm looking forward to

23
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:06,920
it let's give a big warm welcome to

24
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:09,770
David Ewan Duncan thank you good morning

25
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,190
everybody thank you for oh thank you

26
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,869
thank you for coming out this morning

27
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:17,179
this looks more like San Francisco where

28
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:23,810
I live here in Austin than what I would

29
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:26,000
expect to have happen in Austin so I am

30
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,220
going to give you a little bit different

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,729
perspective than some of what I saw

32
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:34,908
yesterday I'm basically an observer

33
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:38,240
participant in what's going on with body

34
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:40,909
hacking all of these new leading-edge

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,789
technologies so as a journalist I am

36
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:46,130
have this incredible privilege to hang

37
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:48,710
out with great scientists great

38
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,539
technologists engineers others that are

39
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,059
designing our future basically and

40
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,960
that's how I learn and one way that I

41
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:59,240
tell stories and I started doing this

42
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,189
got almost a dozen years ago is I try

43
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,729
out the new technologies anything that

44
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:06,199
basically won't hurt me in fact all the

45
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,189
all the different stories I'm about to

46
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,819
share with you and all these different

47
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:13,549
technologies that I've checked out sort

48
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:17,540
of test-driven if you will the one

49
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:19,010
dictum was do no harm to me although I

50
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,590
did violate that a couple times

51
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:25,159
as you will see not too harmful I'm

52
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:27,799
still here standing mostly intact so I'm

53
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:28,870
going to start out though asking you a

54
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:31,640
question

55
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,049
so I know you all kind of stumbled in

56
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,319
maybe you're out late last night at the

57
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:37,940
wormhole party which was pretty cool but

58
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,679
I would like you to participate here for

59
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,590
just a second if you will are you ready

60
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,599
are you okay with that

61
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,769
boy that was enthusiastic but I know

62
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:48,108
it's morning there we go

63
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:51,079
all right there's always one all right

64
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:52,700
this is kind of the ultimate question

65
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:54,470
and by the way one thing that I get to

66
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:58,069
do is a journalist too and I'm really

67
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,540
interested in is the implications of all

68
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:01,220
these technologies all the amazing

69
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,650
things we saw yesterday you're gonna see

70
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,730
today and the great thing about this

71
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,290
meeting as there are a lot of

72
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:09,349
discussions about this I think there's a

73
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:12,108
session after this on ethics you know

74
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:14,060
what does all this mean how is it gonna

75
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:16,370
affect us yeah what are we gonna look

76
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:19,370
like in 50 or 100 years you know that's

77
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,930
that's what I'm fascinated with so the

78
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:25,940
ultimate question really is why are we

79
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:28,699
even doing this so I in the 164 project

80
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,739
the one I'm 164 project I give talks all

81
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:33,230
over the world and we I've asked over

82
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:34,400
50,000 people the following question

83
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,340
which is how long do you want to live

84
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,690
and I am really kind of throwing that at

85
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,430
you you may have thought about it some

86
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,919
people obsess about it some people don't

87
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,530
think about it at all and I'm gonna give

88
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:48,290
you four possible answers here and then

89
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,030
I'm gonna ask you to vote on each one 80

90
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:53,078
years which is the current life

91
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,970
expectancy you know in the West and in

92
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:59,449
America this is about how long we live

93
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:01,760
now 120 years which a little bit of a

94
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:04,099
jump there but that's as long as human

95
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,569
beings have lived as far as we know so

96
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:09,798
that's still within the natural realm

97
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:12,530
but way out there 150 years now no one

98
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:15,379
as far as we know is lived 150 years so

99
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,909
this would mean probably some technology

100
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:19,039
that it would allow you to do this I'm

101
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:20,959
not telling you there's going to be but

102
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:22,940
you were free in this little thought

103
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,120
experiment to imagine that there might

104
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,610
be a technology and then forever okay

105
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,590
and some of my Silicon Valley friends

106
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,470
who want to live forever insisted that I

107
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,299
add this to the survey

108
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,220
I funded a more metaphysical question

109
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,100
because as far as we know the universe

110
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,780
will not last forever but anyway I will

111
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,770
put that up there for you so how many

112
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:47,650
people want to live 80 years okay I

113
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:53,710
can't really see you but if a few okay

114
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:57,370
a few okay 120 years okay actually I

115
00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:01,090
think that that's more all right 150

116
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:03,670
years okay that's probably about the

117
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:07,330
same I can't quite see you also

118
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,980
how about forever oh yeah okay this is

119
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:12,729
what I would expect at a body hacking

120
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:14,830
conference so at the end of the talk

121
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,830
here I am gonna share with you how the

122
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:21,250
other 50,000 people voted when we get to

123
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:24,490
that section meanwhile I'm going to

124
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:27,460
share with you three areas that I report

125
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,169
on that I find kind of begin to build

126
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,940
this story towards what the future is

127
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:32,830
going to look like and so we'll have

128
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,200
three sections the first one I've done a

129
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:37,030
lot more work on you as data the second

130
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,610
one is enhancement and the third one is

131
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,830
radical life extension so the last two

132
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,350
will be a little shorter here but let's

133
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,229
just jump right into this you as data

134
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:50,500
now what I mean by this literally you

135
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:53,380
personally your family this is my family

136
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,600
it could be your family and this is what

137
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,710
we look like on the outside if you met

138
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,720
my family that's what they would look

139
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,539
like this is what we look like on the

140
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,600
inside so these are all of the different

141
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,669
aspects that are studied right now and

142
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,800
we're trying to learn about its the

143
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:11,530
proteome it's the genome it's the

144
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,710
microbiome and how the environment feeds

145
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:18,760
into all of these systems the brain etc

146
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:21,099
and by the way this is about data and I

147
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,979
give a whole talk called bio babble too

148
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,690
much data to little understanding and

149
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:28,450
giving you parts of that here but this

150
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:31,060
is an unbelievable amount of data the

151
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:33,130
things we were seeing yesterday you know

152
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:37,419
thus obsession in Silicon Valley with

153
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:41,020
data and in fact data is the greatest

154
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:42,900
invention of humanity I would argue our

155
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:46,240
ability as humans to create information

156
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,758
this is what we do I mean it's really

157
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,340
it's beyond the Parthenon the Great Wall

158
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:56,590
of China the pyramids this is what we do

159
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:58,690
and we do it pretty well in the last 50

160
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:02,020
years or so you know we've gone from

161
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:04,690
pencil and paper to digital and beyond

162
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:07,240
and it's extraordinary what we've done

163
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:10,870
in fact this is what we're producing per

164
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:14,620
day right now 18 exabytes of data this

165
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:17,139
compares to 1995 just 21 years ago when

166
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:21,610
the entire internet or the tire web was

167
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:22,900
point oh three terabytes so that's where

168
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,009
we are and by the way I'm going to show

169
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,099
you in a minute all the data I've

170
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:29,319
collected on myself is 10 terabytes so I

171
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:31,300
have personally one guy more data than

172
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:34,900
existed in the entire world just 21

173
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:38,550
years ago and just to show you a lot of

174
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:42,190
zeroes here right now in the world there

175
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:44,889
6.6 zettabytes which is 10 to the 21st

176
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:46,509
and that's a lot of zeroes and this I

177
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:49,060
just change this slide actually

178
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:52,389
yesterday for the talk it used to be two

179
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,190
point one which is from 2013 so we have

180
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,180
tripped more than tripled the data in

181
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,789
just three years

182
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:00,099
so and by the way we're just at the cusp

183
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:00,990
of getting health data that's been late

184
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:04,810
to the party

185
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,099
imagine when everybody has all the data

186
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:11,289
that I'm going to describe to you and

187
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:14,620
more and it turns out as I said that

188
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:16,568
creating data is easy but we're really

189
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,870
in need of a second great invention I

190
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:22,060
think the 21st century will be all about

191
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,979
interpreting that data no what does it

192
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,810
mean how do we make sense of it that's

193
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:28,150
what's hard right now it used to be hard

194
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:31,389
to create the data eat much easier now

195
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:34,510
now it's hard to figure out what it

196
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:36,579
means so I'm gonna rifle through a whole

197
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:39,659
bunch of ways that we create data health

198
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:43,838
data we have patient records we have

199
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:45,689
sequencing we have genetics we have some

200
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,300
kind of cool ones like gene editing

201
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,890
which I both you know hopeful for and

202
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,870
fearful for because it's so easy now to

203
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,000
edit the genome we got scanning

204
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,589
technologies we've got nanotech we've

205
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,740
got the proteome we've got the

206
00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:01,500
microbiome

207
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,510
I stuck this up from yesterday James

208
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,060
Young which I found absolutely

209
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:09,480
fascinating I hope you all were here to

210
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:12,689
see his talk about his as he said sci-fi

211
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,880
prosthetic arm which is totally cool

212
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:17,640
we've got when you get into the hospital

213
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,000
you've now got data being generated that

214
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,339
used to be on clipboards is now on iPads

215
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,670
doctors are using devices a lot more for

216
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:28,980
things like imaging you've got Watson

217
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,880
you know artificial intelligence and

218
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,380
then in the health realm

219
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,080
you've got thick bitch you've got

220
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,060
glucose monitors you've got the Apple

221
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,890
watch you've got little devices you

222
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:41,369
stick on your head that relax you and

223
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:43,529
create data scanadu which is a company

224
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,260
that I've been trying out this is they

225
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:47,850
actually call this a medical tricorder

226
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,080
just like in Star Trek and you stick

227
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,810
that on your head and it measures a

228
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,000
bunch of stuff this is my friend Rachel

229
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,819
Clayman who actually wears all of these

230
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,320
devices 24 hours a day she says I don't

231
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,320
know you kind of wonder shower I don't

232
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,700
know whatever anyway but just to give

233
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,910
you a little hint of why we need to

234
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:08,700
learn to interpret this Rachel has you

235
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:10,290
know probably 40 50 devices on here some

236
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,420
of which are the same device you know

237
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,770
replicated and almost all of them

238
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,579
produce different data on the same

239
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,899
things so in a Consumer Reports kind of

240
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:20,130
way of looking at it there's still a lot

241
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:23,339
of work that needs to be done to make

242
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:25,170
that right and like sometimes talk about

243
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,279
the you know business implications of

244
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,099
this and I'll just give you one little

245
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,270
slide on this this is basically what

246
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,279
we're talking about is a realm of

247
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:36,149
personalized health how we stay healthy

248
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:39,180
and Pricewaterhouse did a report back in

249
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:40,950
2009 that suggested that this market was

250
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,890
around 200 billion dollars back then

251
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:47,790
they said what predicted that it would

252
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:52,829
be 450 billion in 2015 it actually was

253
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:53,610
750 billion so that is a huge number and

254
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:55,620
when you think about all the

255
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,360
technologies were discussing here you

256
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,250
know this is not a business oriented

257
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,470
meeting but you know just think about

258
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,329
the sheer you know amount of money

259
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:07,199
that's involved with this for better for

260
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:09,779
worse so all that testing I did we call

261
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:11,378
it the experimental man project and I

262
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:15,489
wrote a book and I'll give you the your

263
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:19,029
you can check it out so here's what I

264
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:23,639
did and that is my sort of EEG

265
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:26,169
Rastafarian look so I had six I have

266
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:28,359
60,000 DNA markers identified our

267
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:30,759
genotypes annotated as they call it my

268
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:33,369
full genome I had done in 2010 which was

269
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:36,849
pretty early I have over a thousand

270
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:38,859
toxins inside of me we all have little

271
00:11:36,849 --> 00:11:41,259
trace elements of pesticides and metals

272
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:43,179
or tiny tiny little amounts I did a

273
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:45,159
National Geographic story on this it's

274
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:47,379
hard to believe ten years ago and they

275
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:48,909
actually sent me on a on a chemical

276
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:50,829
autobiography of where I would have been

277
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:52,989
exposed to things like DDT because I

278
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:54,549
grew up in Kansas when I was a little

279
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:56,649
kid where they sprayed DDT which has

280
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:58,809
been a long banned pesticide that it

281
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:03,039
stays in the environment and inside of

282
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:08,049
you a very long time MRI and CT scans

283
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:09,069
I've had my brain in an MRI scanner way

284
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:10,539
too many times it's actually

285
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:12,189
extraordinarily boring you're just

286
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:14,679
laying there and I even fell asleep a

287
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:16,029
couple times which the researchers we're

288
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:18,429
not very happy about because it costs

289
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:21,220
several hundred dollars an hour to to

290
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:23,499
use these things proteomics micro

291
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,499
microbiome and then more recently

292
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:29,259
wearables apps things like that so all

293
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:31,479
of this created literally tens of

294
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:36,399
thousands of data points and as I said

295
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:39,339
about ten terabytes of data which

296
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,019
actually if we all had 10 terabytes of

297
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:44,109
data which you know we're hoping to do

298
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:47,199
someday perhaps we would be in something

299
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:49,089
called yota bytes and I hope somebody

300
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,618
someday can tell me where Yoda bytes

301
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:52,629
came from if you look it up on Wikipedia

302
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:54,369
it just says yota bytes it doesn't say

303
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:57,159
it was just some guy named yota is this

304
00:12:54,369 --> 00:13:00,789
you know they misspelled you know Yoda

305
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:02,739
from Star Wars I don't know but this is

306
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:04,539
a really big number 10 to the 24th

307
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:06,449
that's got three more zeroes than the

308
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:09,309
zettabytes I showed you earlier and

309
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:11,799
there is a little side thought here on

310
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:14,259
how we even deal with all this something

311
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:18,279
like 6% of the electricity in the u.s.

312
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:20,289
goes to servers right now and we produce

313
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:22,029
a lot of electricity in this country so

314
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:23,649
you know just thinking about that

315
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:24,470
because the cloud is actually really all

316
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:26,060
these giant server

317
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,340
Farms which which produce a lot of heat

318
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,750
and etc so anyway this is what I get to

319
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,760
do as a journalist we play around with

320
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:36,680
these little kind of practical details

321
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:40,040
okay that sounds cool but unfortunately

322
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:43,310
I am no longer the number one guy though

323
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,050
with the most data this man Larry Smarr

324
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:47,780
who I actually saw in San Diego a couple

325
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:50,540
years a couple days ago at UC San Diego

326
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:53,329
he has about 30 terabytes of data that's

327
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:56,839
partly because he and pardon me saying

328
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:58,700
this but he collects his poop every two

329
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,200
days and does a microbiome and he's been

330
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,910
doing this for five years he has

331
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,720
irritable bowel syndrome and that's

332
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:07,130
actually his is microbiome behind him on

333
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,110
this giant screen that he invented he's

334
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,300
a engineer and actually an

335
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,640
astrophysicist so he has more data than

336
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,310
I do much Schneider a stanford has even

337
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,960
more data at 40 terabytes but he's had a

338
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:20,119
clinical genomics at Stanford and just

339
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,370
has more toys than I do to play with us

340
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,310
which is sort of annoying that he has

341
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:27,410
that advantage but anyway so what does

342
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:30,829
all this mean I'm going to give you just

343
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:33,079
a few little results here that give you

344
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:37,130
an idea of both the potential and some

345
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,780
of the issues with this data I have a 50

346
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:41,090
percent increased risk for a brain

347
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:43,490
aneurysm okay

348
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:45,470
that sounds kind of scary right a little

349
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:48,290
vessel exploding in your brain maybe

350
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:51,230
causing a stroke but what that really

351
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:53,270
means is it's a probability based on one

352
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,800
genetic marker and first of all one

353
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,660
genetic marker doesn't really tell you

354
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,250
that much about you because you are a

355
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,439
lot more than one genetic marker but

356
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,120
these almost all of the genetic testing

357
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,670
that you hear about is a population

358
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,100
study that takes one marker or cluster

359
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:10,130
of markers and compares one population

360
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,050
that has a has had brain aneurysms with

361
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,060
those who don't and they don't take

362
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,530
anything else into account yeah there

363
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,540
might be a whole lot else going on in my

364
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:20,329
body that might prevent me or even make

365
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:23,180
it you know more of a risk than that it

366
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:26,350
also 50 percent increased risk means

367
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:28,579
that as a white male I have a 1 in

368
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:31,520
200,000 chance of having a brain

369
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:35,330
aneurysm on average that means I have a

370
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:37,860
1.5 in 200,000 so that does not sound

371
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:40,260
quite as scary

372
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:43,769
another category of genetic testing is

373
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:46,560
is pharmacogenomics which means you have

374
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:49,680
genes that help you process or not drugs

375
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,839
and so warfarin is a blood thinner that

376
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,180
they give you after surgery to keep your

377
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,380
your blood from clotting and getting

378
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,170
stuck in your brain in various other

379
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,120
places very common in surgery but it's

380
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,740
been known for a long time that certain

381
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,019
people are sensitive to it so you have

382
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,990
to be very careful how you dose it turns

383
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:09,660
out I am a hyper metabolizer of warfarin

384
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,310
so you would not want to give me the

385
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,439
full dose you know it would actually

386
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,000
cause me great harm and so we have a

387
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,800
genetic test now that can tell you that

388
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,300
and that's got by the way a lot more

389
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,240
validity because they have actually run

390
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:25,829
clinical data through that longitudinal

391
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:27,959
data on fact millions of people so that

392
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:29,579
has a lot more accuracy to it and then

393
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,969
there's this category of DNA around

394
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:35,370
behavior and you know they test all

395
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:39,209
kinds of things you know mu moods and

396
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,529
anxiety and you know etc etc risk taking

397
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:42,420
there's a bunch of genes associated

398
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:44,790
supposedly with that this is you're

399
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,160
getting in system you know really

400
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,899
difficult territory here what you know

401
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,569
can you really actually make predictions

402
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:53,399
like that about DNA because the

403
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,800
environment and other factors play a

404
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:59,220
huge role obviously in in many of these

405
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:04,829
issues and including behavioral but I

406
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:06,390
came out high risk for low empathy but I

407
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:08,329
always give this little thing but I

408
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:11,669
don't care what you say

409
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:12,990
so but that's a it was a small study in

410
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:15,720
Germany it was about a hundred and fifty

411
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,919
Germans I don't know I have one German

412
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,439
ancestor that I know of

413
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,569
maybe it's relevant to me maybe not you

414
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,089
know maybe maybe Germans well we won't

415
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:28,079
go there anyway okay

416
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:33,149
I love Germans so let's move into the

417
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:35,580
toxin area just a couple of readings on

418
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:38,010
that as I said I grew up in in eastern

419
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,500
Kansas actually when I was a little kid

420
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,179
they were still spraying DDT this

421
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:47,760
long-acting pesticide it was banned in

422
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:51,059
1975 it actually shows up in my body at

423
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,990
about 50 percent higher level than the

424
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:54,928
Centers for Disease

425
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,429
control national mean and this is no

426
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:59,640
longer a probability by the way this is

427
00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:02,460
an actual level so I'm at but again this

428
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:06,150
is so trace and so small we don't really

429
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:08,070
know what it means they always say that

430
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,840
you know the dose makes the poison

431
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,090
like plutonium would kill you instantly

432
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:16,590
even a you know a microscopic speck of

433
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:19,919
it other chemicals it very low doses who

434
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:23,428
knows so another one is mercury

435
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:25,500
I had three times the CDC level when I

436
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:27,330
was tested but three weeks later this is

437
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,059
again the dose makes the poison and also

438
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,570
time 3 your body clears mercury very

439
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,399
fast

440
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,559
I had just eaten a couple of big fish

441
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,500
actually was an experiment that we were

442
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,450
doing you know large fish have high

443
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,090
levels of mercury little fish are fine

444
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,880
you should eat them but swordfish other

445
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:48,209
big fish have lots of mercury in them

446
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,670
and so in about three weeks if I had

447
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,770
another measurement I would probably be

448
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,870
normal because your body clears mercury

449
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,129
very fast as opposed to DDT which is

450
00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:01,620
still around you know after all these

451
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:04,559
years MRI scans there is an MRI test you

452
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,449
can take it's very expensive it can give

453
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,070
you some prediction on whether you have

454
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,240
Alzheimer's or not basically it's

455
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,460
measuring the beginning of plaque

456
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,750
buildup before you show any symptoms so

457
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,870
that's being used now it's very

458
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,820
expensive and it still has some issues

459
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:20,610
but it's being used now as a predictive

460
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,919
tool in some cases and then one of my

461
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,990
favorites again they test behavior in

462
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,100
MRI scans and these are functional MRIs

463
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,080
that measure the blood flow in your

464
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,669
brain you're given some sort of stimulus

465
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,260
usually with goggles attached to a

466
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,340
computer you know you might see

467
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,410
something horrible or something

468
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,899
wonderful and they measure the blood

469
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:40,140
flow in your brain and so I came out

470
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,760
normal for greed and I don't even know

471
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,450
what that means I also came out normal

472
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,640
for altruism

473
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:47,490
I mean what's normal for greed I don't

474
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,110
know anyway and most of these tests

475
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:51,150
because it's so expensive in the MRIs

476
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:53,129
you're being compared to about 25 people

477
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:55,080
and those of you who know I think about

478
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,820
statistics know that that's pretty

479
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,600
irrelevant and they tend to be grad

480
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:02,809
students so anyway I guess compared to

481
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,879
25 grad students I have normal green and

482
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:07,020
then heart attack risk

483
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,900
this is where it gets interesting

484
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,370
because a lot of what I was trying to do

485
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,710
with this experiment is what does this

486
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:16,409
all mean for me as a you know is it kind

487
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:20,010
of every person can I learn anything

488
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:22,050
because as we know you know medicine is

489
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,550
very siloed and in fact all the

490
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:26,610
different technologies sort of remain

491
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:28,620
yeah really a part and as you'll see

492
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:31,860
I've devoted a lot of my time and energy

493
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,929
recently to trying to work on that that

494
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,179
problem because you know we are not

495
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:38,100
separate like that image I showed you

496
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,230
earlier we're not just a brain floating

497
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,709
over here and a genomic system over here

498
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:47,760
yeah we're one big dynamic system so I

499
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:49,260
took one disease area and try to do as

500
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,890
much as I can get every test possible

501
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:55,379
and and bring it all together so I did a

502
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:56,220
heart attack risk but this is where it

503
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,100
gets interesting

504
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,230
because I did get some predictions but

505
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,790
this is all my date I won't go through

506
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,470
through it all but some of this is

507
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,820
traditional data like cholesterol some

508
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:09,150
of its genetic which is a little more

509
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:12,179
out there but I got everywhere on the

510
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:14,850
map you know predictions of low medium

511
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,500
and high risk for heart attack and which

512
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:20,939
obviously shouldn't happen it should be

513
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:23,850
one or the other I did on one very

514
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,260
complex algorithm that was being a model

515
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:27,510
it was being developed on heart attack

516
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:30,300
risk I got a very high risk factor for

517
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:32,040
that compared to what my doctor would

518
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:35,040
tell me with with current standard of

519
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,510
care which was very low so I don't even

520
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,879
know what all that means it's a little

521
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:40,530
scary to get walk in and have somebody

522
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,870
tell you you have a 70% risk of heart

523
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:45,510
attack in 20 years if you gain a half a

524
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:48,149
pound a year it's all tied to weight but

525
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:51,840
if you don't gain anything you have a 2%

526
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:53,010
risk factor now in the future these are

527
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,679
the kind of predictions we're going to

528
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:57,600
get and in a way it'll be up to us to

529
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,460
decide which trajectory do we want to go

530
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,260
on and everybody will be different at

531
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,720
the moment though it's still really up

532
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:05,340
in the air how accurate all this is so

533
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,790
my favorite genetic marker I didn't

534
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:12,000
bring my coffee out here the caffeine

535
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:13,649
fast metabolizer gene okay how many of

536
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,950
you can drink coffee

537
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:19,160
before you go to bed and you're fine

538
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:22,430
okay it's always about 25% of

539
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:24,860
so about 25% of us carry this marker and

540
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:27,320
I do and I love it I love coffee I it

541
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,760
drives my friends crazy though whoo

542
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,260
you have to stop drinking coffee at 3

543
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,300
o'clock when I have a cup of coffee

544
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,830
after dinner it's like you know they

545
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,149
look at me like are you kidding you're

546
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:37,580
gonna be up all night and I'm like no

547
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,200
and that's because my body processes

548
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,970
caffeine very very fast

549
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,920
I still get some other symptoms if I

550
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,870
drink too much I get jittery but what

551
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,520
does gene effects is the wakeful center

552
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,260
of your brain so it just simply doesn't

553
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,200
it doesn't stay in your body long enough

554
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:52,810
to stimulate that wakeful Center and

555
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,850
then there are a lot of metrics around

556
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:57,350
fitbit's and things I I've actually come

557
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,929
to like Withings but there are lots of

558
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:03,530
others and this is just some of my steps

559
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:06,230
and apparently I have a frowny face

560
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:07,910
which means I was very bad that week and

561
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:10,760
then this is another set of data from

562
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:13,100
scanadu which measures heart rate blood

563
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,530
pressure things like that and blood

564
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:18,560
oxygenation and so the oxygen levels of

565
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:20,060
my brain and this is that little medical

566
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,389
tricorder device that you saw the little

567
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:26,960
kid putting up his forehead now again

568
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:28,730
this is exciting and some data is soon I

569
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,710
think this will mean a lot it's already

570
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:33,010
beginning to in some cases but you see

571
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:37,340
that red dot there for blood oxygenation

572
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:40,100
that indicates I'm dead so I'm not dead

573
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,100
so I was able to sort of truth' that one

574
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:46,310
really quickly but 80% blood oxygen is

575
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,730
not really very compatible with life for

576
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,280
a human

577
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:50,630
so that was an inaccurate reading so

578
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,399
there's still some work to be done again

579
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,720
on this area of how do we use this data

580
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,520
how do we make sense of it how do we

581
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,910
make sure it's accurate and I'm going to

582
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:02,320
dig a little deeper and a couple of

583
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:05,630
areas here that I spent more time on and

584
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,879
again trying to you know put this data

585
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:09,920
together the book and the project were

586
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,050
design were split up into genes

587
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,840
environment brain and body the body part

588
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:16,610
was where we tried to tie it together so

589
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,679
in this case we're trying to tie

590
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:22,310
together an environmental factor which

591
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:24,590
is mercury exposure and genetics and I

592
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:26,600
really literally nobody really does this

593
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,740
or at least I thought nobody did it

594
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,030
there are a few people that are working

595
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,440
on it but it's not common the

596
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:32,180
geneticists don't really talk to the

597
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,419
toxicologists and vice versa in fact

598
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,169
they had

599
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:35,840
a whole different way of approaching

600
00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:38,570
science the toxicologists approach it by

601
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,070
now how does mercury do its you know

602
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,989
terrible things yeah what are the

603
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:44,330
mechanisms there how does it you know

604
00:24:41,989 --> 00:24:46,629
mess with cells what are all the things

605
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:49,039
that happens so that's mechanistic

606
00:24:46,629 --> 00:24:50,899
geneticists come at it from statistics

607
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,158
they do these population studies I was

608
00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:54,498
telling you and then they work down

609
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,090
towards mechanisms so you would think

610
00:24:54,499 --> 00:24:57,799
that there could be a nice little

611
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,080
meeting in the middle and in fact that's

612
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:03,619
what happened when we when I looked into

613
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,019
this mercury in genes so genetics

614
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:09,470
sensitivity to mercury we all know that

615
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:10,850
some of us can go out in the Sun and get

616
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,679
sunburned within five minutes

617
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,809
other people can go out all day and

618
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:17,059
they're fine and same goes with

619
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:20,259
virtually any environmental input you

620
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:22,970
know the food that you eat everything so

621
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:24,409
mercury is no different some of us are

622
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,389
more sensitive to it than others this

623
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:28,759
has been known actually for centuries

624
00:25:26,389 --> 00:25:30,590
some people who like the Mad Hatter's

625
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:32,419
back in the nineteenth century they used

626
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,129
to make felt hats and mercury was part

627
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:35,600
of that they called the Mad Hatter's

628
00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:37,309
because some of them with Looney Tunes

629
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,090
they went crazy with the mercury and

630
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:43,210
their brains but curiously not all did

631
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:46,249
so we've known this for a long time so I

632
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,960
went out to see how do I fit into that

633
00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:50,269
with my genetics and my environmental

634
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,639
testing am i sensitive to mercury or not

635
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:54,889
or protective some people are protected

636
00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:56,479
and these are some of the results I'm

637
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:59,209
not sure you can even see that so I

638
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,489
apologize for that but these are

639
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,929
different species of mercury as they say

640
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:05,210
methyl mercury is a little different

641
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:07,970
than an elemental mercury but these

642
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:10,700
different genes affect things like mood

643
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:14,899
it's mostly mostly neural but it also

644
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:17,149
can cause asthma and cancer so and this

645
00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:20,449
is all pretty preliminary data that

646
00:26:17,149 --> 00:26:23,059
little red see there on the GC that's

647
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,730
genetic code suggest that I am at

648
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:28,639
elevated risk for BDNF with mood

649
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:29,869
disorders and things so again I mean I

650
00:26:28,639 --> 00:26:35,748
care what you think because the empathy

651
00:26:29,869 --> 00:26:38,449
but don't get be upset okay this is a

652
00:26:35,749 --> 00:26:42,690
little scary here this is the mercury

653
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:45,960
concentration in the u.s. from 2010

654
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:49,349
so you can see it collects basically

655
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,119
mercury that gets inside of us starts in

656
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:53,369
coal burning power plants gets up in the

657
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:55,320
atmosphere and then it sometimes goes

658
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:57,330
for hundreds of miles before it settles

659
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,369
back down on the earth it's particularly

660
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:01,590
bad in the ocean because it falls in the

661
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:02,970
ocean it's absorbed by plankton and then

662
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,830
the fish start eating it and that's why

663
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,419
those big fish are more dangerous and

664
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,899
small fish because they eat the small

665
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:11,129
fish

666
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:13,469
it's called bioaccumulation and this is

667
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,859
just three years later so let me go back

668
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,919
here

669
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:18,509
you can see like say California is

670
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:21,090
pretty clear here mm-hmm

671
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:22,739
this is just in three years and we are

672
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:25,379
actually you know there's a huge debate

673
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:29,039
at the federal level now about reducing

674
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:30,570
power plant emissions over mercury so

675
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,749
you can kind of see why this is a bit

676
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:37,649
urgent at least in my view but there are

677
00:27:33,749 --> 00:27:39,330
hot spots there places I'm not really

678
00:27:37,649 --> 00:27:41,279
sure why it's white on the bottom there

679
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:43,109
maybe that they were their measurements

680
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,479
didn't cover that because I think Austin

681
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:47,849
is right on the edge of that I can't

682
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:51,899
even tell exactly looks like it's not as

683
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:53,070
bad as say northern New Mexico anyway so

684
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:54,928
I actually took this several steps

685
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,369
further I've been recently becoming more

686
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:58,139
of an entrepreneur I'm still doing a lot

687
00:27:56,369 --> 00:28:00,059
of writing but started a company called

688
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:02,279
eco sand we're developing a product

689
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:04,349
actually around mercury sensitivity

690
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:06,330
called mercury wise and hopefully in a

691
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:08,609
few months you'll through your doctor be

692
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:11,460
able to order this it's a genetic test

693
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:13,139
and that's what the kit looks like we

694
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,019
send you a little swab kit you send it

695
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:18,899
into our lab and you get a result on

696
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:21,570
it's for children by the way if your

697
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:23,459
child is particularly sensitive mercury

698
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:26,009
and we gave even more important we give

699
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:28,799
you a bunch of ways to avoid mercury so

700
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:29,940
your child isn't exposed and unlike a

701
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,619
lot of that data that I showed you

702
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,879
earlier which is statistical data

703
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:38,369
population studies this is actually a

704
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:40,309
clinical trial that this test is based

705
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:43,109
on and this is really important because

706
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:47,039
most of medicine doesn't use genetics

707
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:49,259
because physicians and others need some

708
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,299
kind of evidence beyond just a

709
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:52,769
statistical study you know how does this

710
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:54,658
work in the real population and the

711
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:56,310
genetic testing that's using that's used

712
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,960
regularly in matters

713
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,790
like say there are a couple of good

714
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,150
tests for breast cancer rakia one and

715
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,889
two

716
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,480
those have been clinically validated

717
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:06,960
meaning that they've been tested in a

718
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:09,390
population and you test them over time

719
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,640
to see if they develop the condition in

720
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:13,380
that case breast cancer and that one's a

721
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,300
very obvious one actually Braccio one

722
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:18,210
and two it's only a small percentage of

723
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:21,690
breast cancer cases but it's it's very

724
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:23,010
pernicious so if you have that it

725
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,380
usually runs in families

726
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:27,090
that's only it's about I forget them

727
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,900
there's a new number for that it used to

728
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:32,720
be about 12% of cases but anyway so

729
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,910
having clinical data is really important

730
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,170
and this is what the results were which

731
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,640
which is kind of scary

732
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:42,480
to be honest with you one in five

733
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,910
children in this study by the time they

734
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,500
turned 17 or 18 they were between I

735
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:50,580
think it was 8 and 10 when the study

736
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:52,790
start a seven-year study they the kids

737
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:56,340
who had these at-risk genes or 5 genes

738
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:59,010
and that the the highest you had a six

739
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,899
year developmental delay on things like

740
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:03,090
attention memory you know these

741
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,890
batteries of neuro behavioral tests if

742
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:06,270
you're exposed to mercury this is very

743
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,970
small levels of mercury like from eating

744
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:10,950
fish are the silver fillings which some

745
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:13,200
of you probably still have those are

746
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:15,690
half mercury and they're still actually

747
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,420
putting kids mouths every year is 40

748
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:22,760
million fillings amalgam fillings are

749
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:24,960
put in every year so one in five

750
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,340
three-day year three to six year

751
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,410
developmental delay I'm not sure where

752
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,530
that doesn't say six it should be three

753
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:33,870
to six but the good news is that you can

754
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:35,190
avoid mercury pretty easily and we have

755
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:37,050
a bunch of ways that we tell you how to

756
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:39,690
do that but this has a strong effect

757
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:43,200
size and the p-value you know basically

758
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:46,620
the the accuracy of this is is very high

759
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,470
so this is what a report looks like I

760
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:51,449
actually came out a medium risk so I

761
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:53,850
funny enough don't even really like fish

762
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:57,270
so there may be some defensive mechanism

763
00:30:53,850 --> 00:31:00,360
that we have to keep us I mean I'm okay

764
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:01,980
with it but so you know it wasn't that

765
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,240
hard for me to just avoid fish I do

766
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,280
however still have several

767
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,100
amalgam fillings in my mouth which I

768
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:10,110
should probably have removed and we call

769
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,658
this eco genetics by the way

770
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:14,908
which is again this idea of of trying to

771
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:18,210
combine things and the tryout of life

772
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:21,480
it's its genes and traits which are

773
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:24,929
things like diseases and and the

774
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:27,419
environment so another little deep dive

775
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:32,730
here is around stem cells this is

776
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:34,620
actually me as stem cells and stem cells

777
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:37,289
naturally occur a few days after

778
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,418
conception and when the embryo is

779
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:40,769
forming and stem cells are what all the

780
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:42,419
other cells grow from there are two

781
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:43,440
hundred and twenty some odd types of

782
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:46,110
cells in the human body

783
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:50,370
they all come from this little cluster

784
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:52,320
of cells and you know grow into hearts

785
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,559
and lungs and brains and things like

786
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,990
that

787
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,210
this particular stem cell line does not

788
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:59,669
come from one I know a few days after

789
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:03,630
conception this is a process called

790
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:06,210
induced pluripotent stem cells and this

791
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:09,389
is how this works I sent some blood into

792
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:11,070
a company in Wisconsin that then reverse

793
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:13,949
engineered my white blood cells which

794
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:15,840
have DNA in them and it's actually been

795
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:18,809
pretty easy to do this they reversed

796
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,059
them back to an embryonic like state so

797
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:23,279
you go back to where they originally

798
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:25,080
came from essentially and then they can

799
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:29,490
take those cells and grow them into any

800
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:31,769
cell which is totally wild and they grew

801
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,760
them first into heart cells for me and I

802
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:35,340
don't know if you can tell but those are

803
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:38,549
actually beating little heart cells my

804
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:41,158
heart cells in a petri dish and we ran a

805
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:43,649
little experiment to see how different

806
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:45,510
drugs which are very toxic to heart

807
00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:47,639
cells like most chemo therapies would

808
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,649
affect my heart cells and so we try

809
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:51,389
Gleevec you know chemotherapy for a

810
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:53,969
number of cancers and it turned out that

811
00:32:51,389 --> 00:32:56,010
I my cells had a normal reaction so you

812
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:58,169
know hopefully I will never need Gleevec

813
00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:01,470
but if I did this could be a way to test

814
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:02,880
or screen drugs to see you know if

815
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:04,200
they're gonna be particularly toxic I

816
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,029
mean it's very it's way too expensive

817
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,429
and still a little experimental to try

818
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:09,899
this say in a hospital but someday we

819
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:11,700
will all have a stem cell line like that

820
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:13,379
and if you do need these different drugs

821
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,830
they can test them in your cells before

822
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:18,690
they put them in you

823
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:20,490
we also whoops let me go back here

824
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:22,740
because it's kind of cool these are

825
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:24,160
brain cells which were recently made and

826
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,700
these cells on the

827
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,900
are just normal cells my cells the ones

828
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,640
on the right have been treated with

829
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,440
SSRIs you know which they used for

830
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,580
depression and you can't really tell all

831
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,840
that much difference there but there

832
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,810
actually is a pretty big difference so

833
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:41,169
that drug does affect your neurons so

834
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:43,750
what have I learned from all this not

835
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:45,400
much I mean I've learned a lot about the

836
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,530
technologies which is a story teller is

837
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,840
what I set out to do but as an

838
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:51,100
individual I'm still really waiting for

839
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,629
this interpretation there are a few

840
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,340
things that have been interesting and

841
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,110
important I mean I took that heart

842
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:58,120
attack risk seriously enough that I

843
00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:02,290
changed my diet around and a few other

844
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:06,820
things but mostly this is still yet to

845
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:10,570
be interpreted and and it will happen it

846
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:13,000
should be but it will not but I will so

847
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:17,980
a few issues on this area before we move

848
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,750
on to enhancement you as data as I

849
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:22,270
mentioned earlier I kind of used the the

850
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,949
Babel Tower of Babel which is really

851
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,840
where we are right now it's you know if

852
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:27,460
you know the story everybody spoke to

853
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,560
same language until they tried to build

854
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,720
a tower to heaven and then God created

855
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,509
language you know according to the

856
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:35,739
biblical story and cause all the yeah

857
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:38,110
they couldn't talk to each other so they

858
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:40,209
couldn't finish the tower to heaven but

859
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:42,220
basically I'm using it in the sense that

860
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,870
you know everybody's kind of talking in

861
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:46,418
a different language and needs to go

862
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:47,759
actually go reverse the Babel story back

863
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:51,219
to speaking the same language

864
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,560
this need for an interpreter own the

865
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:55,359
need for something I call fusion which

866
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,370
other people call convergence I just

867
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,480
think fusion is a cooler word but we

868
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,009
need to obviously bring all this

869
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,000
together in a kind of dynamic way

870
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:05,320
there's also a gap as I'm you know do a

871
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,760
lot of reporting and talk to both

872
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,440
engineers and biologists there's this

873
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:13,570
extraordinary philosophical gulf between

874
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:17,460
engineers and biologists and I actually

875
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:19,960
wrote a story recently a column that

876
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:22,000
biologists are from Venus and engineers

877
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,860
are from Mars I mean when you talk to

878
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,420
them they just fundamentally have

879
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,110
different points of view on how we're

880
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,780
going to solve all these problems

881
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:30,670
engineers assume that the human body is

882
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,630
like a giant computer and we'll just

883
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,700
figure it out pretty quickly

884
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,590
biologists sort of laugh at that because

885
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,149
they know that we actually don't know

886
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,990
that much about the human body someday

887
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,760
maybe the engineers

888
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:41,290
we'll be right but probably not anytime

889
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,300
soon

890
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:45,520
and there's issues of regulation law and

891
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:48,520
ethics which I write a lot about which

892
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:53,520
play in here and again it's happening

893
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:57,070
but very slowly so oh yeah this is new

894
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,990
I'm actually going to write a updated

895
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:01,990
version of the original experimental man

896
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:04,750
book and any of you that have cool

897
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:06,220
experiments that won't hurt me you know

898
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:09,460
I'd love to hear about them because I'm

899
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:11,020
going out in the world again to really

900
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,810
update this most of my experiments were

901
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:15,280
done back for this book in 2009 although

902
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:16,930
I continued it to some of them but

903
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,510
obviously lots happened since then and

904
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:21,129
so help me out here

905
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,800
so enhancement I'm going to go through

906
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:25,930
these next couple of areas here pretty

907
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,930
quickly and then we'll we'll have some

908
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:30,310
questions if you all have any so I I

909
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:32,890
wrote a series on the New York Times

910
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:34,830
about enhancement which was kind of fun

911
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:38,020
we a lot of interesting responses

912
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:42,210
they're kind of general actually about

913
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:44,890
doping at the Lance Armstrong thing

914
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:47,230
various ways to read brains like we saw

915
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:49,569
yesterday I worked with Stephen Hawking

916
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:51,160
this is kind of cool story it's a single

917
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:54,119
electrode the disguise invented an

918
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:58,000
algorithm to be able to read brainwaves

919
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:59,740
and Stephen Hawking is trying it out and

920
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,030
then how long do you want to live and

921
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,950
then there were several others over the

922
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:06,730
years not only in York Times but in

923
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:09,250
other publications and this is another

924
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:11,680
survey we I asked you the question about

925
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:13,450
how long do you want to live but we also

926
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,029
sometimes do a survey about how far

927
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:18,910
would you go enhancement and this is

928
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:21,460
particularly apropos to this this

929
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:24,569
meeting we asked a group of Silicon

930
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:27,070
Valley people how far they would go and

931
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:28,840
surprisingly 20% of them said not not

932
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:32,260
very far basically whatever's available

933
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:34,600
now on the other end of it about 19%

934
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:36,850
wanted to just download themselves into

935
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,980
a computer and get rid of their frail

936
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:41,140
human body and then you have in-between

937
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,400
we were seeing some of the bionics

938
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:45,580
yesterday there were very few people

939
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,380
that would you know willingly move into

940
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:52,450
bionics which is mean removing their

941
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:54,760
their natural limbs and then on about

942
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:56,319
28% the largest one would take a super

943
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,240
drug that would make them a little bit

944
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,390
smarter a little bit stronger and then

945
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,310
we had stem cells so I'm not gonna ask

946
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:05,020
you to vote on this but yeah it's

947
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,400
interesting to think about as we're

948
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:09,009
talking about body hacking and all of

949
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,960
that how far would ya be really if you

950
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:13,000
really have these options like a little

951
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,119
menu like that what would you actually

952
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,830
do and you know I'm not it's interesting

953
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:20,080
how some people don't think about that

954
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:23,350
other people again obsess about it so

955
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:25,779
there you go so some of the technologies

956
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:27,279
they're happening around enhancement

957
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:31,030
this is Aimee Mullins

958
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,340
who is missing her lower legs but was a

959
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:36,040
track star in his now model and an

960
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:39,010
actress and she said something wonderful

961
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,350
to me about you know as an actress and

962
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:45,250
she has a leading man who might be tall

963
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:47,830
or short she can adjust herself and hue

964
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,240
hair who who is at MIT Media Lab and

965
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:51,790
also is missing his lower legs and

966
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:54,160
designs prosthetics for wounded warriors

967
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:57,009
and others he told me that he's more

968
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,049
enhanced than we are and that he's not

969
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:01,510
only enhanced mechanically or Bionic Lee

970
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:03,070
but he is socially enhanced because he

971
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:05,680
can adjust his height it can do all

972
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:08,050
different things that we can't do so

973
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,089
interesting to think about that we've

974
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:13,150
got exoskeletons which are coming online

975
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:15,369
they're still pretty clunky this is a

976
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:19,030
cochlear implant that helps people they

977
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:20,859
can't hear hear and by the way all of

978
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:24,220
these technologies are for people who

979
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:28,330
are disabled or ill or you have had you

980
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:30,069
know some deficit and the curious thing

981
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,720
about and what my series was about is

982
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:35,320
that many of these technologies in the

983
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:38,020
near future will be you know applicable

984
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:40,720
to healthy people potentially to enhance

985
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:43,420
themselves and also those who who have

986
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,930
had deficits as well they could push

987
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:49,359
beyond yesterday as discussed a little

988
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:51,339
bit I mean what if you go from having a

989
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,440
deficit to actually you know being

990
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,450
enhanced compared to people that don't

991
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,570
have the deficit so these are all issues

992
00:39:55,450 --> 00:40:00,669
that are going to be coming up although

993
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:02,030
the the gentleman who is in this picture

994
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:05,270
here

995
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:06,680
michael chorost I asked him well could

996
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,450
you just turn that up and like hear a

997
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,690
pin drop across the room and he said

998
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:14,240
he's tried that but you hear everything

999
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:16,040
and he said it may be that we don't want

1000
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,649
to enhance hearing much beyond what we

1001
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,750
have this nature has decided this is

1002
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,950
what we can absorb I mean there's so

1003
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:24,080
many sounds in this room that we can't

1004
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:25,819
hear right now and if you turn that up

1005
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:28,180
you it might actually drive you crazy so

1006
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:30,890
that's kind of interesting this is a

1007
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:33,319
woman who had a stroke thirteen years

1008
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:35,830
before this picture was taken she she

1009
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:38,210
became paralyzed from the neck down

1010
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:40,610
she's had a brain implant actually

1011
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:43,790
surgically implanted in her motor cortex

1012
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:46,160
and she was able to operate through a

1013
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:50,840
computer I asked this question yesterday

1014
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:53,230
actually to the panel you know would

1015
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:56,060
they do it but she did do it and

1016
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:58,100
obviously paralyzed but for the first

1017
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:00,410
time in 13 years she was able to with a

1018
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:04,160
prosthetic arm which was not attached to

1019
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:06,049
her move a canister of coffee and as she

1020
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,279
said have a sip of joe for the first

1021
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:10,520
time under her own power

1022
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,870
which was pretty well and these are by

1023
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,700
the way hooked up with wires at the

1024
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:15,230
moment but the scientists working on

1025
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,609
this are going to make this wireless and

1026
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:19,730
kind of embed it in your head so you

1027
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:22,010
actually wouldn't even see it and again

1028
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:24,050
I don't think any of us are gonna have

1029
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:25,880
brain surgery right now especially since

1030
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:28,820
this doesn't really work very well but

1031
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:32,660
who knows in the future we've got a lot

1032
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:34,430
of genetic fixes we have drugs out there

1033
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,410
right now I did a whole series of

1034
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:40,430
articles on adderall and steroids and

1035
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:42,770
when I looked into you know minor use of

1036
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:44,649
these drugs like literally apparently

1037
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:46,490
millions of people use adderall

1038
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:49,220
occasionally if they need to stay up all

1039
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:50,779
night a student who has finals week or

1040
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:53,270
you know people that have to get out of

1041
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:56,330
something at work and they're up all

1042
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:58,700
night several nights in a row and these

1043
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:00,680
people take this and they don't get

1044
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:03,049
addicted they they don't keep taking it

1045
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:06,140
you know beyond these these occasional

1046
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:08,750
needs and there's no evidence really

1047
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:13,129
either way that that minor use of

1048
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:14,690
adderall is bad are good and this piece

1049
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,790
was really that I wrote was saying

1050
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:18,260
we should be testing this to understand

1051
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:21,980
how it works in healthy people if

1052
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:23,600
millions of people are using it and but

1053
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:25,310
of course that's that's not ethical now

1054
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,990
and how we test drugs the steroids are

1055
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,940
the same we hear all these scary things

1056
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:30,500
but people who use very low levels of

1057
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,520
steroids there's now again millions of

1058
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,810
people probably tens of millions of

1059
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,880
people there's not a lot of evidence

1060
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:36,890
that it causes that much harm but we

1061
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,300
don't know it could be long-term harm we

1062
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,859
just we're not even running the studies

1063
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:42,470
to find out

1064
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:45,020
you also have in a realm of enhancements

1065
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:47,450
this has been mentioned but this is a

1066
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:50,180
trachea there was grown from stem cells

1067
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:53,240
and these have been successfully

1068
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,799
implanted and a few people who are

1069
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,450
missing a trickier get them damaged

1070
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,220
bladders is another one these are very

1071
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:01,819
simple organs so they don't have a lot

1072
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:04,129
of vascular complexity or nerve

1073
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:06,770
complexity but this is actually

1074
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:08,750
happening as well it's really literally

1075
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:11,120
a few dozen people have had them it's

1076
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:12,530
still extremely experimental but this is

1077
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:16,250
where we start getting the spare parts

1078
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:19,040
so someday you know your heart begins to

1079
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:23,000
break down one way that you not only

1080
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:25,040
could be fixed but possibly enhanced is

1081
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,250
through this technology and then some

1082
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,440
issues around enhancement first of all

1083
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:32,150
it's coming and I don't have to tell you

1084
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,710
all that but a lot of people get a

1085
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:37,010
little freaked out when I talk about

1086
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:38,900
this we need to make certain decisions

1087
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:40,430
as a society on all this technology

1088
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,110
which I'm not sure that we're really

1089
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:44,569
keeping up with you know what does it

1090
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:45,620
really mean who controls the software I

1091
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:50,030
think somebody mentioned this yesterday

1092
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:52,040
I mean you know does Google or you know

1093
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:54,770
Apple or I don't know the federal

1094
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:57,050
government will put out a court order

1095
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:59,540
that they you know your encrypted data

1096
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:02,030
and your you know in your brain needs to

1097
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:04,190
be released you know to law enforcement

1098
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:05,570
or something I mean these issues that

1099
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:07,850
are playing out around smart phones and

1100
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:08,930
things will play out around us at some

1101
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:12,200
point

1102
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:12,740
so there are Frankenstein issues here

1103
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,970
too

1104
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:18,680
you know something could go wrong you

1105
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:20,359
know who knows how this will come out

1106
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,399
and then what does it mean to be a human

1107
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,590
which is a broad philosophical question

1108
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,000
so just quickly here and then we'll go

1109
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:29,650
to questions ultimately

1110
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,870
a lot of this whether you know whether

1111
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:37,240
we intend it or not will lead a radical

1112
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:39,580
life extension and in this little book I

1113
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,529
wrote it was a TED book it was very it's

1114
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:43,900
very short if you have a short attention

1115
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:47,140
span it's just take you a couple hours

1116
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:50,140
to read but you can find it it's an

1117
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:52,330
e-book but there are animals Nature has

1118
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:54,870
actually created some very long-lived

1119
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:58,330
organisms this is Harriet the tortoise

1120
00:44:54,870 --> 00:45:01,600
died I think it was 2007 this was

1121
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:03,130
discovered by the Beagle the crew of the

1122
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,410
Beagle that Darwin was on in the

1123
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:06,820
Galapagos as a young as a young tortoise

1124
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:08,920
and they brought it back

1125
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:11,980
the tour ended or she ended up in

1126
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,960
Australia and lived you know well over a

1127
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,790
hundred years and just just died

1128
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:18,970
recently so tortoises live a very long

1129
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:21,970
time certain lobsters it's not clear

1130
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:24,069
that they actually ever died of old age

1131
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:26,049
they usually are caught or eaten or

1132
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:28,450
something they don't even start

1133
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:32,260
producing children or you know baby

1134
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:35,950
lobsters until several years later than

1135
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:38,200
most organisms do so apparently and

1136
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:41,109
these are all evolutionary strategies

1137
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:44,230
for survival so the point of this is

1138
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:46,210
that in some organisms living a very

1139
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:48,010
very long time it's been something

1140
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:51,330
that's evolved so it's not impossible

1141
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:53,650
that other organisms might be able to

1142
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:55,990
Institute that this is something called

1143
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:57,820
a water Bell or a tear guard water bear

1144
00:45:55,990 --> 00:46:00,660
that's a microscopic little animal

1145
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:04,570
creature that lives in pond water and

1146
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:06,730
these guys also seem to be immortal they

1147
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:10,450
get usually eaten something happens to

1148
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:12,430
them but they don't appear to age beyond

1149
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:14,140
a certain point they've even taken these

1150
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:16,299
little guys in the space and they've

1151
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:18,190
exposed them to a vacuum they shut down

1152
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:21,130
and when you put them back in their

1153
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:24,940
environment they really key so there's

1154
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:27,100
some pretty tough little creatures so

1155
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,330
how do you get radical life extension in

1156
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:32,440
this book I talk about four different

1157
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:34,029
areas there's health and hygiene which

1158
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,320
you don't think about in the context of

1159
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:37,150
all this cool technology but this has

1160
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:39,040
actually gotten us where we are now we

1161
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:40,840
we've almost well we've more than

1162
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,259
doubled lifespan since the late 19th

1163
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,420
century

1164
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:45,910
if you start with birth even if you

1165
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:47,619
start at age five or age ten we're

1166
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:49,960
living a lot longer and a lot healthier

1167
00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:51,550
and this is what's gotten us here it's

1168
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,970
not technology if you look at all the

1169
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:57,369
data it's really people eating better

1170
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:59,200
cleanliness things like that so that's

1171
00:46:57,369 --> 00:47:02,170
gotten us this far and it's still a

1172
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:05,259
major part of of how we know would

1173
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:06,700
extend our own lives this is Hugh hare

1174
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:08,560
who I mentioned earlier that designs

1175
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:11,859
this is some of the legs he's designed

1176
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:14,890
but bionics is is another way again as

1177
00:47:11,859 --> 00:47:16,900
our human parts begin to break down we

1178
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:20,350
could potentially in the future replace

1179
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:21,820
them genetics is a big one and then the

1180
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:25,330
stem cell technologies literally

1181
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:27,369
regrowing and this is a cornea I saw not

1182
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:29,619
from this picture but I actually saw a

1183
00:47:27,369 --> 00:47:31,270
gentleman who had had his corneas

1184
00:47:29,619 --> 00:47:32,859
damaged he'd been blind for several

1185
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:35,230
years had never actually even seen his

1186
00:47:32,859 --> 00:47:39,029
children and they took some stem cells

1187
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:42,130
from his eye and they grew corneas and

1188
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:45,280
surgically implanted them and the first

1189
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:47,080
thing he saw was his daughter and he

1190
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,000
actually even got a driver's license

1191
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,710
with but with lenses you know with

1192
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,050
glasses he can actually see okay it's

1193
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:55,480
sort of amazing and again these

1194
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:59,770
technologies could be is to enhance as

1195
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:03,280
well so how did your vote come out

1196
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:09,940
compared to 50,000 people drumroll

1197
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:11,350
anyway oh sorry you all were of course

1198
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,910
quite different because we're at a body

1199
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:16,330
hacking conference you could almost

1200
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:19,149
reverse this the forever is only about

1201
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:21,190
3% the 80 years as a vast majority of

1202
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:22,750
people and it's interesting because I

1203
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,800
think people are very conservative when

1204
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:25,420
they start thinking of their own lives

1205
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:30,310
and how this might shake out with

1206
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:33,490
technology we only had 10% at 150 and

1207
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:36,009
29% now there's an online survey that

1208
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,209
you can take at when I'm 164 calm if you

1209
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:39,369
all want to take it it's an ongoing

1210
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:41,020
survey and I need to update to slide

1211
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:43,390
because it's actually quite a while ago

1212
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:45,270
but the forever people tend to vote a

1213
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:48,850
lot on this whereas the 80 year people

1214
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:52,150
don't so it's creeping up this it's now

1215
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:53,799
to about six or seven percent so anyway

1216
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:55,119
kind of just an interesting this is a

1217
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:59,289
very informal it's just raised

1218
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:01,720
like you did so what does the science

1219
00:48:59,289 --> 00:49:04,569
say right now about life expectancy even

1220
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,999
without this technology this is you in

1221
00:49:04,569 --> 00:49:08,558
predictions and you can see in about a

1222
00:49:06,999 --> 00:49:10,689
hundred and fifty years well the

1223
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,369
trajectory that we've been on since 1900

1224
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:14,559
and this is without enhancements this is

1225
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:16,059
just basically the good food and

1226
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,039
technology our good food and hygiene

1227
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:20,619
with some of the technology thrown in

1228
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:23,619
and you can see it begins to level off

1229
00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:25,390
for women in the developed world which

1230
00:49:23,619 --> 00:49:27,549
is the way they count these things will

1231
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:30,069
be you know up close to a hundred and

1232
00:49:27,549 --> 00:49:34,059
150 years so we will actually continue

1233
00:49:30,069 --> 00:49:36,730
to increase life expectancy even without

1234
00:49:34,059 --> 00:49:40,329
these really radical technologies so

1235
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:44,470
1900 it was 47 years old and 2150 95

1236
00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:46,839
years old so the final part here why are

1237
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:48,910
why not would you want to live to be 150

1238
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:51,009
years old and we did a survey when I had

1239
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:52,749
a little program at UC Berkeley called

1240
00:49:51,009 --> 00:49:54,700
the Center for life science policy and

1241
00:49:52,749 --> 00:49:56,140
we actually did a you know these aren't

1242
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,299
really that formally there but it was a

1243
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:00,730
paper survey we sent it out so here's

1244
00:49:58,299 --> 00:50:01,930
what people put down the people that

1245
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:03,400
wanted the lid to be hundred and fifty

1246
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:05,069
they could spend more time with their

1247
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,210
loved ones this again my family

1248
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:09,279
hopefully they you know they would also

1249
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:11,230
if there was some technology involved

1250
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:14,140
would indulge in the technology and so

1251
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:15,249
you all live a little longer you might

1252
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,450
have time to do something that you'd

1253
00:50:15,249 --> 00:50:19,140
always meant to do but didn't have time

1254
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:22,660
like learn to play the piano get a PhD

1255
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:26,650
whatever Albert Einstein would actually

1256
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:27,999
still be alive if you had technologies

1257
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:30,910
that could have kept him alive and he

1258
00:50:27,999 --> 00:50:33,519
was living to be 150 Steve Jobs might

1259
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:35,230
still be with us who knows what he would

1260
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:38,709
say about this new controversy with the

1261
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:40,749
iPhone and my favorite one is you get to

1262
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:42,970
see the future I mean I'm really curious

1263
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:44,319
that's I'm not sure I really want to

1264
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:47,980
live like a hundred years to find out

1265
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:49,749
but I would really like a historian I am

1266
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,190
fascinated of course with the future as

1267
00:50:49,749 --> 00:50:52,689
well so what is it going to look like

1268
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:55,029
this is what people in the 50s thought

1269
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:57,460
it would look like now obviously that is

1270
00:50:55,029 --> 00:51:02,170
not very accurate you know so what's

1271
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:03,880
what's it's going to happen and then you

1272
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:05,499
get to why people wouldn't want to

1273
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,539
and there's actually a longer list here

1274
00:51:05,499 --> 00:51:08,980
this is the oldest woman that we know of

1275
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:11,440
that's ever lived

1276
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:15,520
her name was June June Claude oh she

1277
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:17,850
died in 1997 at 123 years old but people

1278
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,990
don't want to be old and frail longer

1279
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:22,779
you know some of these many of these

1280
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:25,720
technologies may help you stay you know

1281
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:27,610
not not die in this time span you would

1282
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,470
have but you're gonna be old and frail

1283
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:31,000
longer and a lot of people that's what

1284
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:33,419
they imagine living longer to be about

1285
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,700
in fact that is what happens now mostly

1286
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:39,040
and because it's about as they say

1287
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,450
health span not life span how healthy

1288
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,310
you are you know how are you gonna pay

1289
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:43,859
for it you know you might be riding high

1290
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:46,570
now but we all know things can happen

1291
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:50,440
recessions in fact then there's a

1292
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:52,870
resource question some everybody

1293
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,610
suddenly stopped dying you know how

1294
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:57,490
would that shakeout in terms of

1295
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:59,890
population and resources you have these

1296
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:02,049
little pesky things called dictators and

1297
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:06,670
Wars and horrible things that can happen

1298
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:09,370
if you live longer Wars plague this is

1299
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:11,260
superstorm sandy you know all these

1300
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:12,910
things you have more of a risk and these

1301
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:14,920
are by the way this isn't me saying this

1302
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:16,930
this is what people were worried about

1303
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,220
so we had a whole list of things and

1304
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:19,359
then we asked them to add things some of

1305
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:21,399
these I hadn't even thought of like

1306
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:23,170
superstorm sandy that was survey was

1307
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:28,000
taken not long after that and a lot of

1308
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:31,210
them put that down and then love you

1309
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:35,020
know how many times does that first kiss

1310
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:36,490
with your new whatever you know mean

1311
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:40,870
something or how many times can you be

1312
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:43,180
married I mean 20 30 maybe you know who

1313
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:47,259
knows anyway these are these will all be

1314
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:49,540
questions that will you know come up if

1315
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:51,010
you radically extend lifespan and then a

1316
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:54,910
lot of people put boredom which I was

1317
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:56,560
surprised about I mean I I'm trying to

1318
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:57,580
keep myself from being bored but a lot

1319
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:01,380
of people were worried about that you

1320
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:04,540
live a thousand years you get bored then

1321
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:06,910
finally I want to tell you about a

1322
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:08,500
little project that I'm doing called arc

1323
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:13,140
and we're trying to make some of these

1324
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:13,140
new things happen and this is our little

1325
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:21,309
so it's a community of innovators

1326
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:23,230
basically trying to solve some of these

1327
00:53:21,309 --> 00:53:25,390
problems around this fusion idea and

1328
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:27,400
this age of fusion is health IT and

1329
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:30,578
biomedicine trying to combine all this

1330
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:35,980
plus politics laws economics all these

1331
00:53:30,579 --> 00:53:37,569
other things that are important again on

1332
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,849
the economics this fusional markets

1333
00:53:37,569 --> 00:53:41,259
around four trillion dollars and we have

1334
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:43,059
this little process we're trying to put

1335
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:46,809
together to solve problems which involve

1336
00:53:43,059 --> 00:53:48,609
convening informing and building and you

1337
00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:51,339
saw actually my colleague David Webster

1338
00:53:48,609 --> 00:53:53,880
yesterday speaking from IDEO and arc and

1339
00:53:51,339 --> 00:53:57,730
I do have just started a collaboration

1340
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:59,920
to try to bring this all of this world

1341
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:01,569
these silos and everything together in

1342
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,339
our own small way I mean we're very

1343
00:54:01,569 --> 00:54:04,900
small and these are some of the topics

1344
00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:07,859
we deal with in meetings all over the

1345
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:10,660
world some of the speakers we've had

1346
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:12,910
we're launching the art fusion magazine

1347
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:15,578
soon online and we would like to love

1348
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:17,589
people to join us and I'll end with this

1349
00:54:15,579 --> 00:54:19,059
quote which I'm sure you all know but

1350
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:20,910
it's still my favorite the future is

1351
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:24,430
already here which is not very evenly

1352
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:26,230
distributed and these are the two books

1353
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:28,779
I've mentioned when I'm 160 for an

1354
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:33,299
experimental man their websites devoted

1355
00:54:28,779 --> 00:54:33,299
to each of them and thank you

1356
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:46,810
so I went slightly over but maybe we

1357
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:46,810
have good great

1358
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:57,430
yeah

1359
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:09,260
when you win the transition to the

1360
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:09,260
microphone I missed ya

1361
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:22,160
well amazing thing I found out and this

1362
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:24,320
started by the way with a wired story

1363
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,420
but way back in 2002 when I had myself

1364
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,130
sequenced right after the human genome

1365
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:29,780
project what I mostly found out was a

1366
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:31,790
surprise which is I don't have most

1367
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:33,950
things and in fact that's the way most

1368
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:35,720
of us who are you know survived to

1369
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:37,009
adulthood you'll find out you don't have

1370
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:39,589
most things which is kind of good news

1371
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:41,510
but you know I was at risk for

1372
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:45,410
hypertension I was at risk for heart

1373
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:48,619
disease some of the you know non-genetic

1374
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:50,750
or you know or things like I I was a

1375
00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:52,070
distance interest runner and my knees

1376
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:54,680
are shot which I kind of knew already

1377
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:56,000
but when I saw that my and an MRI scan

1378
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:58,250
my knees look like somebody had taken a

1379
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,740
hammer and pounded them and I was still

1380
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:03,109
running and I stopped running because

1381
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:05,419
and that was sort of preventing so there

1382
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:06,890
were a few things like that that I

1383
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:08,420
learned but I'm a pretty healthy person

1384
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:09,980
I come from a pretty long list family

1385
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:13,010
which is one reason I could probably do

1386
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:14,780
this several of my friends you know who

1387
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:18,260
have things running in their families

1388
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:20,740
were were like you are you crazy I don't

1389
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,740
even want to know

1390
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,599
[Music]

1391
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,609
[Music]

1392
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:21,169
[Music]

1393
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:37,669
[Music]

1394
00:59:17,279 --> 00:59:23,890
well the tricky because it's highly

1395
00:59:20,829 --> 00:59:28,660
probable that what most these will be

1396
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:31,839
able to only a few people and we always

1397
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:35,600
have this progression technology for

1398
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:38,150
decades now you start which people

1399
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:41,569
really came out all the rich people

1400
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:44,450
could afford it and everybody has so you

1401
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:46,030
could follow that trajectory TARDIS out

1402
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:58,279
this a lot of American technology

1403
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:59,990
actually does not load cost so it's

1404
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:04,220
really hard to tell me hope the follows

1405
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:11,540
that ceiling technology the sealing

1406
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:32,620
process so we'll have a seat on there

1407
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:35,000
since like probably about 80,000 now so

1408
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:41,690
you know don't really affect the wider

1409
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:44,980
position in society I think it's still

1410
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,980
not most people

1411
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:49,810
possibly and

1412
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:35,310
I would start I wouldn't have said this

1413
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:37,319
not long ago but you you can certainly

1414
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:39,750
start with genetics there are a number

1415
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:43,320
of companies and you should know the

1416
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:45,270
caveats that I presented to you but you

1417
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:49,680
can learn a few things you know from

1418
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:51,720
genetics most of the tests I took you

1419
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:53,970
know if you if you have a lot of money

1420
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:57,029
you could take but it would be difficult

1421
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:58,439
to to actually replicate the deeper

1422
01:01:57,030 --> 01:02:00,090
stuff but there are a lot of other

1423
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:02,700
things I mean some of these were pretty

1424
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:04,470
regular tests some of them were

1425
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:06,299
relatively cheap some of the things that

1426
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:08,129
you were showing here you know you're

1427
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:10,470
beginning to get from it's like a

1428
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:12,960
ground-up stuff I'm the stuff I did was

1429
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:15,270
mostly from medical people and you know

1430
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,550
they established technologists some

1431
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:20,280
things but the DIY movement and all of

1432
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:22,740
that is I think going to create cheaper

1433
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:25,440
alternatives and it still has a little

1434
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:27,509
ways to go you know to get to sort of

1435
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,850
medical grade but all the things we're

1436
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:32,570
seeing here just keep going basically

1437
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:32,569
keep doing it

1438
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:47,280
[Applause]

1439
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:11,680
all around wondering what you what your

1440
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:15,850
knowledge is about people that are using

1441
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:17,890
this technology really yeah yes I think

1442
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:26,799
obviously we're talking about quality of

1443
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:29,140
life I mention even what they do think a

1444
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:32,170
lot about relationships I mean we're

1445
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:36,900
really longer now we we see you know our

1446
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:39,340
parents than ourselves living healthy or

1447
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:41,500
some of these other issues come into

1448
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:44,380
play but that's really what it's all

1449
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:46,930
about I mean I am the voyagers and you

1450
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:50,800
know just technology allows persisting

1451
01:03:46,930 --> 01:04:00,640
for decades or even partially huge

1452
01:03:50,800 --> 01:04:05,460
market economy which might happen but if

1453
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:08,049
your brain is so aging this is going to

1454
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:11,640
so I think the quality of life divided

1455
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:13,640
about that really important for all this

1456
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:16,890
relationships

1457
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,890
