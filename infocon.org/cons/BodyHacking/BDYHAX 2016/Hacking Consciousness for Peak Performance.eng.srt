1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:12,400
they were we're going to be hearing from

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:17,680
Aubrey Marcus I'll be mark is founded on

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,830
it in 2010 as nutritional supplements

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,720
brand based on holistic health

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:26,439
philosophy and he calls total human

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,689
optimization and this talk is going to

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,460
cover the technologies you can use to

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,259
hack your consciousness ensuring that

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,980
you have every opportunity to go for

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,539
your wins inspired by his lifelong

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,010
experience as a multi-sport athlete as

12
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:40,440
well as that background in ancient

13
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,809
philosophy

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,280
Marcus's goal was to create a company

15
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:48,669
that empower customers to achieve their

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,960
fullest human potential and I'm really

17
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:54,730
really looking forward to hearing about

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:57,089
how I can also achieve this so let's

19
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:01,898
give a big warm welcome to Aubrey Marcus

20
00:00:57,089 --> 00:01:03,608
thanks everybody man

21
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:05,170
this microphone seems like overkill but

22
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:07,630
we'll rock it

23
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,960
well rock it all right sounds good so

24
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,520
cool thank you for the intro and the bio

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,869
yeah as I said earlier you know I really

26
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,939
want this to be more of a conversation

27
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:18,070
than speech I'm not going to sit here

28
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:19,990
and talk at you guys I really want to

29
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,000
try to provide as much value as I can

30
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,770
but I'll give a little you know give a

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,689
little background to maybe have some

32
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,869
more jump off points so that we can

33
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:32,169
kick-start the conversation so yes

34
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:34,420
in 2010 I found it on it and that was

35
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,829
really the culmination of a lifelong

36
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:40,780
pursuit of something I call optimization

37
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,820
which to me is at the heart of the human

38
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,969
desire and it's not just optimizing

39
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:48,008
yourself but optimizing this entire life

40
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:49,990
experience you know that's really what

41
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:53,350
we're here to do we get a chance to play

42
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:56,859
this amazing game here in this dimension

43
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:58,990
and the goal should be to optimize it

44
00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:01,298
get as much out of it as possible you

45
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,789
know not stay within some narrow band of

46
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:05,590
this is comfortable but let's go out

47
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:07,149
let's see what we're capable of let's

48
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,070
see what this life is capable of

49
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:11,890
bringing us and that's been a relentless

50
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:14,530
pursuit that I've had you know pretty

51
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,420
much my entire life and played a lot of

52
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,909
sports still play a lot of sports do a

53
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,339
lot of athletics challenge my mind but

54
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:20,629
really

55
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,690
what this talk is about is about

56
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:27,280
consciousness and as I've discovered

57
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:30,560
that's probably the most significant

58
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,459
aspect and driving force in my success

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,290
and happiness is my pursuit of unlocking

60
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:38,569
greater and greater access to my

61
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,910
consciousness and consciousness is a

62
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:43,970
word that people kind of understand but

63
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:46,280
maybe not completely so when I talk

64
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,440
about consciousness I'm really talking

65
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,110
about the force that's animating our

66
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,670
bodies the force of life our best self

67
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,220
not necessarily our mind and our

68
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,260
emotions not necessarily our body but

69
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,390
that other thing that other thing that's

70
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,548
there when all of that all of that fades

71
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:03,380
away and for anybody who's done a lot of

72
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:05,510
psychedelic medicine you understand what

73
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,970
it means when all that fades away and

74
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,170
that's really where I learned about

75
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,569
consciousness that's been my path

76
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:14,690
primarily and I've been very open about

77
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:16,670
it is to use the great plant medicines

78
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,890
of the world to kind of unlock and

79
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,958
facilitate my access to that greater

80
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,250
consciousness so you know when you're

81
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,359
talking about that you might think oh

82
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,130
well what's the point of that is that

83
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:26,959
just spirituality it's really not

84
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,790
because if you think about it you know

85
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,359
what's the one thing that's treated

86
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:37,480
every known disease and ailment in the

87
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:40,010
world anybody know the placebo effect

88
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,440
treated everything absolutely everything

89
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,048
the placebo effect is treated now what

90
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:48,709
is that thing well the placebo effect is

91
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:51,079
your mind or your consciousness telling

92
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:53,720
your body that's going to get well and

93
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:55,549
then the body responds you know and I

94
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,959
think we throw that away science is just

95
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:58,160
like yep let's get that out of the

96
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,829
picture like wait a minute

97
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,840
your consciousness has treated every

98
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:05,329
single disease condition that we've ever

99
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,639
had maybe let's focus on that maybe

100
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:09,590
let's look at that as a primary option

101
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:11,959
instead of discarding that and trying to

102
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,540
get rid of it at all options so from

103
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,608
your health to even you know even the

104
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,918
business you know I have to credit a lot

105
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:21,048
of what Anand has become and you know I

106
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:22,099
feel very blessed to be CEO and founder

107
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:24,229
of on it and we've had a lot of

108
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:26,930
accolades you're an Inc 500 fastest

109
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:29,479
growing company 2015 a lot of success

110
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:32,030
but you know what's not printed in the

111
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:32,859
pages of ink magazine is a lot of that

112
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,419
vision

113
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,640
for what on it was going to become when

114
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,020
I was on I was blasted on a second cup

115
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,780
of ayahuasca in the middle of the

116
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,669
Peruvian jungle when I saw that you know

117
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,619
and so all of these things that people

118
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,080
think honest your spirituality that's

119
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,790
just this thing it all weaves together

120
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,219
when your consciousness is strong it's

121
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,260
like having the right the right force at

122
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,450
the helm of the ship you know not your

123
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,550
emotions not your fears not your greed

124
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:00,400
not any of these other thing not your

125
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,110
pain but real consciousness and

126
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,870
consciousness has free will it has the

127
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:07,690
ability to drop in decide what it wants

128
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,210
for its life and make genuine decisions

129
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,590
and I think that's one of the most

130
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,810
important things that we can have now

131
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,580
it's not all about the plants there's

132
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,560
many other many other ways to access

133
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,289
your consciousness of course meditation

134
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,510
that's the basic primary wanted and

135
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,280
that's really the stilling of the mind

136
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,020
that's the quieting of the mind because

137
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,030
in the stillness in the quiet

138
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,859
that's where consciousness emerges

139
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,659
really everything else is just the

140
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,580
distraction that keeps the mind focused

141
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,710
on these shorter loops keeps you worried

142
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,510
about all predators here Oh someone to

143
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,940
have sex with there oh here's some food

144
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,490
over here but when you get really still

145
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,900
and all of that noise dies down that's

146
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,640
when your consciousness can emerge and

147
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,989
that's really what meditation is and

148
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,880
there's tons of different types of

149
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,210
meditation of course and really you just

150
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,890
have to find the one that suits you the

151
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,539
problem with meditation for most people

152
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,760
they don't really know what state

153
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:01,150
they're going for when they when they

154
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,710
start it like yeah I'm gonna meditate so

155
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,210
what do you what's the end goal like

156
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,370
you've never been there so you don't

157
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,409
really know if you're meditating or if

158
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,410
you're just sitting still for a second

159
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,840
you know so that's when escalating that

160
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,000
technology and using some other forms

161
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,919
becomes really helpful so one of those

162
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,430
ways of course we got kevin johnson of

163
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:23,500
zero gravity floating to do here is

164
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:26,410
flotation tanks and sensory deprivation

165
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,990
and that's a hack that really allows

166
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,820
it's like it's like facilitating

167
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,440
meditation to the nth degree and what

168
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,750
it's doing is that mine that's

169
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,010
constantly looking for perceptions out

170
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,270
there in the world trying to track

171
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,320
things what does this feel like what

172
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,030
does it smell like what does this look

173
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,860
like what does it sound like you know

174
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,349
all of these things that are constantly

175
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,870
mirages in our mind with input in these

176
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:50,580
sensory deprivation tanks

177
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:52,980
all of that goes away stillness and then

178
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,560
the minds like I'm out of here but

179
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,870
there's nothing to do and then what

180
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,150
comes out is either you fall asleep

181
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,430
which is not optimal but it's nice or

182
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,770
your consciousness emerges and that

183
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,870
higher thinking that larger loop

184
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,609
thinking that essential you is allowed

185
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,560
to emerge and then once you've been in

186
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,120
the tank then it's much easier to go

187
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,190
back to your meditation practice and be

188
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,840
like okay I know what I'm going for

189
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,280
I know what the goal is so you can try

190
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,659
these different techniques like than

191
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,609
pasta know where you're focusing on your

192
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,350
breath or open focus where you're

193
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,420
focusing on the empty spaces in your

194
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:26,520
eyes or some other more guided

195
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,830
meditation the meditation I like comes

196
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,810
from Tom Brown and it's called the

197
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,340
sacred silence meditation and if

198
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,840
anybody's interested in a guided version

199
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,810
of that I have a free one up on my

200
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,030
website that's the one I found to be the

201
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,830
most effective it's kind of utilizes a

202
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,650
lot of different techniques and

203
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:46,440
visualization some breath but meditation

204
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:48,000
is like the staple food that's like what

205
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,070
you need to survive and then these other

206
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,050
things can be more like feast like

207
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,520
banquets you know you get as much as you

208
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,070
can but you're going to need time to

209
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,390
digest all that so meditation is really

210
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,490
important in the practice of course

211
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:02,640
floating another great way to do it

212
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:05,340
another thing is Yoga Yoga is another

213
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,729
fantastic art again been around thousand

214
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,260
years for a reason and really that's

215
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:13,530
working your mind through this exercise

216
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:17,580
linking it to breath and motion until

217
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:19,710
you're by moving outwardly and

218
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,169
somatically embodying and focusing

219
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:24,570
everything on that it allow your mind is

220
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:26,490
still in those few moments in shavasana

221
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,260
and the final rest and yoga are some of

222
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,960
the most peaceful still moments that

223
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,299
you'll find and that's again another way

224
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,240
to access your consciousness really have

225
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:37,770
that moment where everything gets still

226
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,150
another way to do it that's again been

227
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,730
around for thousands of years for a

228
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:44,760
reason is dance you know there's a

229
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:46,770
reason that people have been doing these

230
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,150
dance rituals all around the world and

231
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:50,160
it's something in the Western culture we

232
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,990
forgot we turn it into a party thing you

233
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,240
know which is great fun to party and

234
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,280
dance but like an ecstatic dance ritual

235
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,650
where instead of focusing on your breath

236
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,140
like in bed possum meditation

237
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,449
you're just allowing the music to move

238
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,040
your body and emptying dumping out your

239
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,920
mind of all the thoughts and just

240
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,630
focusing on the somatic sensation of

241
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,790
your body in motion and creating this

242
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,220
kind of trance that will allow your

243
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,170
consciousness to emerge so if you look

244
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,720
it up there's different ecstatic dancers

245
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,689
being offered around town and really

246
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,730
around the world it's maybe not that

247
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,930
widely publicized but definitely take a

248
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,480
look after that I'm going to be hosting

249
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,729
one coming up pretty soon at Black Swan

250
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,050
yoga because I found it to be one of the

251
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,520
best ways to do it because the thing

252
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,130
about consciousness especially with

253
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:38,069
plant medicines you tend to like access

254
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,260
it here you know like you're you're

255
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,690
projecting it out and experiencing it

256
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:45,120
kind of outside of the body but with

257
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,820
dance gets like right down into your

258
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,790
feet and your whole body becomes like a

259
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,230
perceiving entity where you can really

260
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,540
embody that consciousness so that's been

261
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,940
one of my favorite method

262
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:59,069
another one is shamanic breathing or

263
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,170
holotropic breathing pioneered by dr.

264
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,330
Stan Grof but it's been around in

265
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,099
different yogic circles for a long time

266
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,680
and then other different individuals

267
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,140
like wim HOF the Iceman who has all the

268
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,390
world records with standing cold in a

269
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,760
variety of different ways but it's a

270
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:17,730
really a process of hyper oxygenation

271
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,600
and through that process it becomes

272
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:24,060
almost like a psychedelic experience and

273
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,400
what emerges is a greater access to your

274
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,500
consciousness and so again another great

275
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,120
opportunity to look around look up

276
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,490
shamanic breathing holotropic breathing

277
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,190
something anybody can do there's no

278
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,780
drugs need to take there's nothing it's

279
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,450
going to cost you it's your own breath

280
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,980
you know and that's the beauty of a lot

281
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:43,290
of these different practices you don't

282
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,260
need anything else to do it or

283
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:49,079
facilitate it and then of course there's

284
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:51,689
plants and the plants are great first

285
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,880
stubborn you know stubborn minds like

286
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,980
myself I mean I couldn't shut this thing

287
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,540
off if I tried like there was just no

288
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,790
way I could do it I couldn't sleep I

289
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,709
can't you know it's really hard for me

290
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,540
so the the plants are more like a hammer

291
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,860
you know you really can't avoid it it's

292
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,120
going to hit you and you're going to

293
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,190
have to respond to it you're going to

294
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,220
have to surrender and allow it to take

295
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,050
you on that journey of consciousness

296
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,760
and so that started for me when I was 18

297
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:16,819
I met a shaman and we went out in the

298
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:21,140
mountains of Mexico and I took a batch

299
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:23,330
of mushrooms in the mountains and I had

300
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:26,830
my first Vision Quest so to speak and in

301
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:29,690
that I experienced my consciousness

302
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,710
removing from my body looking down on my

303
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,150
body very much like a near-death

304
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,820
experience like you've here looking down

305
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:37,130
on my body and going oh there's

306
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,920
something besides that thing that little

307
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:41,689
that neat Zach nice neat sack but this

308
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,180
is what is this thing that's looking at

309
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,920
the meat sack that's something else and

310
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,329
from that moment and I didn't have a

311
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,800
religious upbringing or much of a

312
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:50,060
spiritual practice until then but at

313
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,250
that point that I realized there was

314
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:55,130
something else that wasn't the meat sack

315
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:57,230
and wasn't the mind I was like oh okay

316
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,930
well this is something different and I

317
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:01,460
got to explore that for sure

318
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,370
and that was really kind of a game

319
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,720
changer and since then I've done most of

320
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:10,190
the major medicines of the world watch

321
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:13,340
Yuma ayahuasca iboga I've even tried

322
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:15,560
some that I highly do not recommend like

323
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,270
the frog venom combo which almost killed

324
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,800
me in Topanga Canyon there's a terrible

325
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,260
idea but we can talk about that if

326
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:26,449
anybody's really interested you're

327
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:27,740
interested like you almost died yes but

328
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,080
each of these things has their own

329
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,270
special gift that they're able to

330
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,760
provide in their own special utilization

331
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:37,340
you know and I think learning about the

332
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,110
nature of these medicines and what they

333
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,490
can offer and then trying to figure out

334
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,690
which one is right for you which one

335
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,330
you're called to and when you're doing

336
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,950
that really trusting trusting your

337
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:48,830
instincts trusting what you know they

338
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:51,350
call the calling and then being super

339
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:53,839
careful on who the provider is because

340
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,490
just because it's an indigenous shaman

341
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,900
doesn't mean that they're moral doesn't

342
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,450
mean that they're good doesn't mean that

343
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,730
they're not out trying to harm you

344
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:03,500
rather take your money you got to

345
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,960
understand that in this practice you

346
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,700
know especially in a lot of these jungle

347
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,330
scenarios you know what's the rule of

348
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:13,490
the jungle yep the rule of the jungle is

349
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,380
the strong eat the weak and everything

350
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,000
goes long and that's fine the jungle

351
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,650
sustains itself by the strong

352
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,860
continually eating the weak

353
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:23,720
well the humans of the jungle are a part

354
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,050
of the jungle they are a part of the

355
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,759
jungle

356
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,189
they're not separate from the jungle

357
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,350
they are their spirit is generally

358
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:32,269
identified with the Jaguar which is the

359
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,529
strongest animal in the jungle so you

360
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:36,050
got to understand for them it's not a

361
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:38,899
moral problem if you come to them weak

362
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:41,660
and there's a Jaguar and they eat you

363
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:43,489
that's just a lot of jungle and not bad

364
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,439
not bad people their friends don't look

365
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:48,049
at him like man look like that Jaguar

366
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:49,429
eaten weak people you know it's just

367
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:50,660
it's just a normal thing and we don't

368
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:53,720
understand that because we're like ah

369
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,639
how dare that obviously there's some

370
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,319
great job you know I've gone to many

371
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,319
many great healers who have dedicated

372
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:01,759
themselves to a path of pure medicine

373
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:04,368
and path of pure healing but I'd like to

374
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,769
throw that caveat out there because as

375
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:08,869
this becomes more popular more and more

376
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:10,759
people go down there's going to be

377
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:12,230
situations where practitioners are going

378
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:13,879
to take advantage of that to higher and

379
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:17,629
higher degrees so make sure you're being

380
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:18,799
careful I can go a little bit into the

381
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:21,489
different plants and then we'll just

382
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:24,799
kind of open this up for a conversation

383
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:27,319
so ayahuasca definitely one of the more

384
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:29,660
popular ones in you know kind of the

385
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:31,639
minds of people at this point and that's

386
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,170
a brew that it's been down in South

387
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:37,040
American jungles for a long time and

388
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:38,628
it's a combination of high DMT content

389
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,149
leaf for several different leafs

390
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:45,350
leafs Articuno oh boy yeah hey Juan bisa

391
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:48,139
and they contain either DMT and then DMT

392
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,149
or five Meo DMT but that's not generally

393
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:52,970
orally active and lets you combine it

394
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:54,639
with an MAOI something that inhibits the

395
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:57,110
breakdown of these different compounds

396
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,819
so they found that the combination of

397
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,939
the ayahuasca vine which is the maoi

398
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:05,149
with the DMT containing leaf allow for

399
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:07,639
an orally active DMT experience and the

400
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:11,529
DMT experience is really unlike any

401
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:15,169
other experience you could ever imagine

402
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:17,419
it seems to really open up a portal to

403
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:19,819
an entirely separate dimension whereas a

404
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:21,739
lot of the other plants kind of open up

405
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:23,779
the venetian blinds to allow you to see

406
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:26,480
this dimension in a different way the

407
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:28,489
DMT is really like you're really going

408
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,769
to see something else the ayahuasca

409
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:32,990
inherently though is very challenging on

410
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:35,149
the GI system cleansing but challenging

411
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,520
on the GI system so it has a reputation

412
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:39,320
as the vine of death why well

413
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,069
because you feel so bad and you're

414
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,850
tripping so hard that it pretty much

415
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,520
convinces you that you're going to die

416
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,890
the first time you do it and that's part

417
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:52,189
of the gift of it is that you have to

418
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:54,770
face your death and that's one of the

419
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:57,200
most pervasive fears that we all have is

420
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,939
this fear of death and ayahuasca will

421
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,100
put your face right into it until you

422
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,980
surrender to that fear I remember the

423
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,420
first time I went down and did it it

424
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,100
started going through this escalated

425
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,880
progression of the different ways that I

426
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,500
was dying

427
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,720
first there were spiders that were

428
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,130
crawling in my eyeballs and the spiders

429
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,960
were calling in my eyeballs and they

430
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,250
were going to explode in my brain and

431
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,950
spiders were just going to come out of

432
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:21,380
my face and I was like that's a good one

433
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:25,160
one point for high Watzke disappoints

434
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,480
Robert um but then I'd still kind of

435
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,600
cool with I was like okay I'm cool with

436
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,210
that and then so these eels came up out

437
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,730
of the was all my vision of course but

438
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:36,770
eels came up out of the river and they

439
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,480
went and burrowed into my insides and

440
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:40,520
just started thrashing around and eating

441
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,170
all my organs on the inside of my body I

442
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,199
was like ooh hole I was particularly

443
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:48,199
uncomfortable but I'm cool with that and

444
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,510
then it continued and then I envisioned

445
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,850
myself sliding down this long vine of

446
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:55,819
thorns like Jack and the Beanstalk style

447
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,590
long vaya thorns and I was completely

448
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,200
naked and the thorns were all pointing

449
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:02,780
up and that was really really I thought

450
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,670
rude of ayahuasca to put me through that

451
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:08,240
one but again I was kind of cool with

452
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:09,830
that so I left had to pull you know an

453
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,599
even greater trick out of his bags like

454
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:14,270
oh I'll be by the way you're dying of

455
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:18,050
cancer right now right now die am cancer

456
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:19,520
like that got me freaked out no no no no

457
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,959
he'll see him look I'm healthy I'm

458
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,030
strong what do you mean not dying a

459
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,589
cancer and it met a resistance point it

460
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,930
meant an actual fear something that I

461
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:28,850
was genuinely afraid of and I wrestled

462
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,830
with that for about two hours on the mat

463
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:33,230
where every different tried away I tried

464
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:35,810
to wiggle out with my mind and convince

465
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:38,660
myself I'm young I'm good

466
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:40,940
know everything good ayahuasca you know

467
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,310
would win and it would convince me the

468
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,170
other way and so finally I surrendered

469
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,570
and in life that's a really challenging

470
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:50,750
thing because you're used to seeing a

471
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:52,280
problem and then hitting it with force

472
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,480
I will overcome that thing I will

473
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,540
conquer that thing I won't beat that

474
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,130
opponent I will rise above and in the

475
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,409
plant medicine journey you have to

476
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:03,380
invert that entirely I will surrender

477
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:05,030
deeper you know I will bow lower you

478
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,980
know and it's this whole reverse process

479
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,379
that you have to learn but when you do

480
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,660
that's when the great rewards come so

481
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,820
eventually I surrendered into that and

482
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,110
said if that's the way you know if

483
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,060
that's the truth if that's the way I'm

484
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,010
going then so be it it's been a great

485
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,200
life and the minute I did that the whole

486
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,790
thing shifted and all of this love came

487
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,920
up from the earth it was like kind of

488
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:27,110
like that scene from my avatar all these

489
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,880
like fibers like suck me in and cradled

490
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,500
me into the earth it's like we're just

491
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,180
kidding man everything's good you're all

492
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:37,940
good oh my god

493
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:39,680
God so that was my first encounter with

494
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,780
the vine of death and really you know

495
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,670
help me transcend both the fear of death

496
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,500
and the fear of suffering and you learn

497
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:48,140
these things but you don't always get to

498
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,030
keep the games at 100% you know you have

499
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,980
to go back and you have to continue up

500
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:53,480
your practices and continue to access

501
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,370
these truths you know you reach these

502
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,680
Peaks it's very difficult to stay at

503
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,090
that peak but you get a new baseline set

504
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,060
you get a new truth that you can fall

505
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:04,669
back on so ayahuasca is amazing for

506
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:06,770
overcoming fear fear is something that's

507
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:10,280
in your life that's one of the best

508
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:12,230
medicines and and what I would say what

509
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,210
I would prescribe for anybody if fear is

510
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:17,510
the root cause which fears is a cause

511
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:19,820
for all of us you know another great one

512
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,830
for another great medicine is watch

513
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,780
human and watch human is San Pedro

514
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:27,230
cactus it's been around for thousands of

515
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:30,080
years and interestingly there was a

516
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:32,960
society pre-incan societies called

517
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,600
shebeen in Peru and this society

518
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,980
flourished for about 800 years and it

519
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,389
really puzzles the archaeologists

520
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,730
because during that eight hundred year

521
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:43,760
period there was no war there's no

522
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:46,340
evidence of weapons and destruction and

523
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,780
all the normal you see in human

524
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,449
society during that whole stretch in

525
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:53,899
that region there's none of that well

526
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:56,060
what they they the people who are

527
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,470
curious have not taken more tumor and

528
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,178
figured that out because what's human

529
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,590
was the sacrament of the shebeen people

530
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:03,770
and they would offer it to anybody who

531
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:05,480
came and it's one of the most heart

532
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:08,389
Bandung medicines that I've ever

533
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,430
encountered so really gets you back in

534
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:14,030
touch with the love for life a love for

535
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:16,340
one another love for Humanity so for me

536
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:18,889
that medicine is more about finding your

537
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,720
mission you know and re reinvigorating

538
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:23,030
your love for life you know and your

539
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,000
passion to contribute to this planet

540
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:28,520
your ability to see one another as self

541
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,760
living a different life and that's been

542
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:36,280
a really great gift from the medicine

543
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:40,040
watch Yuma iboga is an African shrub and

544
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:42,860
that comes from Gabon and it's

545
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:47,690
definitely the gnarliest of the medicine

546
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:51,169
so that is truly throwing yourself in

547
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:54,400
the frying pan so the medicine lasts

548
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:57,080
about 24 hours and the whole time you're

549
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,120
relentlessly nauseous I mean I want to

550
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,429
get you nauseous like nauseous like

551
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,350
stomach flu getting nauseous but iboga

552
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,570
gets you on this new level of nauseous

553
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:08,270
like you never it like recalibrates

554
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,980
nausea for you it feels like you're

555
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:13,340
stuck in a high voltage shed like

556
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,720
everything's buzzing like you can't if

557
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,520
you open your eyes it's like you're

558
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,040
looking everything is like that TV

559
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,200
channel that didn't get any proper

560
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,180
signal and it's like all lines and stuff

561
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,590
like that and your heart's pounding

562
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,650
because it's a stimulant that's why it

563
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:29,060
lasts 24 hours so you got 24 hours of

564
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:31,670
your heart pounding in this high voltage

565
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,919
shed in nausea it's so uncomfortable

566
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:36,470
that like just the endorphins you get

567
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,480
from moving like here just gives you

568
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:40,550
that moment of relief that you think and

569
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,430
you just fight for that on your mat

570
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:45,740
can't move for 24 hours it's hell it's

571
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:47,780
truly truly hell and the thing about

572
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,780
these plants is it's like they know how

573
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,160
long they have with you too so whereas

574
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,750
you know some of the shorter acting

575
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,610
plants will give you lessons really

576
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,260
quick like I got you for a hammer how

577
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,340
long I got five minutes okay we're going

578
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:02,180
to go in here we're going to grab this

579
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:03,740
thing the bogus got time for days so

580
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:06,260
it'll stretch something out I remember

581
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:08,570
I've taken it twice which may ask why

582
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,970
would you take that thing why it's

583
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,620
because the first time was so powerful

584
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:14,690
and for me it well I'll tell the first

585
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:17,379
story first for me that's when I really

586
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:21,130
got to identify truly and named the

587
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:23,200
three elements myself iboga told me that

588
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:26,350
this was mud body you know this was my

589
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,850
my meat sack my vehicle the car that I

590
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,439
was driving around and I really got to

591
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:32,469
understand what this thing was all about

592
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,110
these seven trillion cells that have all

593
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:36,760
decided to work in cooperation for the

594
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:39,820
betterment of themselves and the

595
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,440
organism and got to get in touch with

596
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,120
that what its needs were what its

597
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,980
desires were and then the relationship

598
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,949
that had with the mind and the mind

599
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:50,230
being the computer onboard that you know

600
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:52,480
send signals and allows things to

601
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,910
optimize survival and procreation all of

602
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,160
these things and then really understand

603
00:22:54,910 --> 00:23:00,190
what my consciousness was and really see

604
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:02,110
the Trinity of this and it bogus

605
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,630
ruthless - I actually went down there

606
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,740
with my fiancee who I thought I was

607
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:10,450
going to spend the rest of my life with

608
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:12,850
and then for about six hours it

609
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,890
convinced me that we should break up and

610
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:19,030
I was like what the hell like that's not

611
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:21,430
what I came down here for and you know

612
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:24,160
again it's just me wrestling with my

613
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:26,970
mind and of course I very much love my

614
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,920
fiancee but both of us would agree that

615
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:31,090
splitting up was the best thing we could

616
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,210
have done and we're very good friends

617
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:36,850
now so a lot of insight can come when

618
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,350
you have these long times with the boga

619
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:42,129
a lot of lessons a lot of questions that

620
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:45,100
you can get answered also gave me access

621
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:46,570
to you know communicate and and just

622
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,240
understand the world in a much different

623
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:51,370
way so that's why I did it again

624
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,230
despite the hell but when I did it again

625
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:55,810
I kind of forgot how bad it was

626
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:57,460
like I was doing it and I was like oh no

627
00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:00,490
like what did I do

628
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:02,980
why did I do this and then it proceeded

629
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:04,720
it preceded it since it knew it had 24

630
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:06,730
hours and proceeded to show me that I

631
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,880
was a terrible person for like six hours

632
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:13,300
like just the worst person ever just I

633
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,250
was like man I really suck you know and

634
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,260
then like six hours in it's like not

635
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:21,310
just kidding but don't be that person I

636
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:23,170
was like oh this is the worst I don't

637
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:25,690
recommend a bug a bug is very well known

638
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:28,210
for getting people out of addictions

639
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:31,290
because it's really like being an ant on

640
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:34,620
a tuning fork and you're that ants on

641
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:36,480
for discos lang and all of those

642
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,100
vibrations all these weird that you

643
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,960
have going on there's no room for that

644
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,090
anymore it all gets shaken clean it's

645
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,490
like clean slate so clinics like

646
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:48,060
Crossroads clinic down in Mexico having

647
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:51,210
amazing above 90% heroin addiction cure

648
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:53,250
rates whereas obviously standard care

649
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,390
methadone all these other things are

650
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,100
getting you addicted to a different

651
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,410
substance and the recidivism rate is

652
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:01,169
super high so it's extremely powerful

653
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:03,390
that for that and honestly unless you

654
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,770
have a significant addiction I'm not

655
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:07,170
sure a bogus really the way you need to

656
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:10,560
go I think there's like kinder gentler

657
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:12,630
ways to do this you know so hopefully

658
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,340
hopefully pretty soon if Maps does what

659
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:17,100
it's able to do we'll be able to have

660
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,990
legal mdma-assisted psychotherapy and

661
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,480
then if you really want to escalate

662
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:23,880
things and ayahuasca and these different

663
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,560
other medicines I like the ritualized

664
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,300
context of these medicines too there's

665
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,940
different ways that you can play with

666
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,889
these things on your own and sometimes I

667
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,050
can have value but sometimes I can carry

668
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:36,030
a lot of risk as well setting the right

669
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:38,100
container the right space the right

670
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:40,260
intention the right people the right

671
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,260
medicine super crucial you know these

672
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:45,360
aren't things to be trifled with you

673
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,790
know I really can't more strongly

674
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,290
emphasize that what you put into it on

675
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,639
the front end is going to be what you

676
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,810
get out of it on the back end so if

677
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,060
you're really serious about using these

678
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,659
as tools for consciousness not just a

679
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,669
carnival ride

680
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,550
then then really pay attention to that

681
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:02,370
set and setting I think that's crucial

682
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:03,690
so obviously there's you know other

683
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:06,020
different types of medicines and

684
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:08,490
different ways that you can do that but

685
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:11,190
you know to me whenever whenever things

686
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:13,260
are off and whatever I'm out of touch or

687
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:16,380
whenever something's going weird I feel

688
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:18,540
out of control I feel confused I just go

689
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,010
back to these technologies you know I

690
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,360
just know that as soon as my

691
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:24,420
consciousness is in the driver's seat

692
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,810
I'll figure it out you know one way or

693
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,970
another

694
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:29,730
it's going to be alright I'm gonna be

695
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:31,230
you know I'm gonna be standing on a

696
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,180
stage somewhere and giving a talk

697
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,920
everything's gonna be okay you know and

698
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,750
I think that's an important thing for

699
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,700
everybody to remember it's like we're

700
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:41,070
all pretty much bat in a thousand you

701
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,780
know we're all here we're all right but

702
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,908
nonetheless as we project out into the

703
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:47,129
future everything looks like nah

704
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:49,169
going to take me out for sure you know

705
00:26:47,129 --> 00:26:52,228
but really you know in the end having

706
00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:53,519
the faith that I'm going to be alright

707
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:56,580
it's going to work out one way or

708
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:59,129
another you know and generally that's

709
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,599
going to be rewarded a lot more than the

710
00:26:59,129 --> 00:27:03,029
fear now doesn't mean you don't plan for

711
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:05,039
 you know but uh but that's an

712
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:06,599
important thing in consciousness you

713
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,849
know and accessing that is a great way

714
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:12,928
to remind you that and and you ensure

715
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:14,460
that process happens quickly so that's a

716
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:15,629
little bit of my journey I definitely

717
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,419
want to leave a lot of time for

718
00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:20,820
questions and I'm here and I just want

719
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:21,929
to be a service to you guys and you know

720
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,809
I've experienced a lot of different

721
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:27,149
stuff and so any kind of you know

722
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:29,789
personal questions or things that you

723
00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:47,849
guys are stuck with let's uh let's have

724
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:50,879
a chat sound good cool mm-hmm well I had

725
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:53,489
a shaman shaman assistant and then my

726
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:55,859
fiance at the time so there was two of

727
00:27:53,489 --> 00:28:04,919
us under and two of us two people

728
00:27:55,859 --> 00:28:06,418
guiding okay she asked how many people

729
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:09,419
were there at the ceremony when I was

730
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:10,859
doing iboga and there was two shamans or

731
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:13,889
someone shaman one Sheldon's assistant

732
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:16,369
and then both of us were down same time

733
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:19,889
they had a shift change at about our

734
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:22,519
sixteen I'd say we're a nurse started

735
00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:22,519
checking in on us

736
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:32,440
you got a question yeah

737
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:41,029
is it on doesn't sound like it's on

738
00:28:55,550 --> 00:29:00,399
[Music]

739
00:28:56,709 --> 00:29:03,169
that works you mentioned the idea of

740
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,928
there are different ways to go about

741
00:29:03,169 --> 00:29:08,629
taking the plant medicines and you fully

742
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:11,359
support the idea of the shamanic ritual

743
00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:13,899
as opposed to just taking it on your own

744
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:16,820
and I was wondering if you might

745
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:23,178
elaborate a little more on that with

746
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:26,979
this consideration which is for some

747
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:30,529
people having the shaman present is

748
00:29:26,979 --> 00:29:38,209
adding an additional narrative that

749
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:40,999
might be influencing their own I have

750
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:43,039
done of both so I have a friend who's

751
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:45,320
done it on his own and he did all the

752
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:48,019
research on his own and he he prefers

753
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,718
that and then I've had the experience

754
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:53,209
where it was like with the shaman and it

755
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:55,519
was more like the idea that ayahuasca

756
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:58,879
there that there's a there's a plant

757
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,919
spirit and you know referred to as a

758
00:29:58,879 --> 00:30:02,299
feminine kind of plants there and

759
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:05,749
there's a lot of like kind of leading

760
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:08,079
and I'm just wondering what you know if

761
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:10,849
anything what your take on it

762
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:14,200
well that's a it's an interesting

763
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:17,450
question you know for sure and I think

764
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,769
it really there's no exact answer to

765
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,899
that because it depends on the quality

766
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:21,999
of the experience the individual and the

767
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:25,129
shaman there's a lot of like

768
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:27,950
individualized parts to this if the

769
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:31,158
shaman is good they are working with the

770
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:33,229
technology that they understand - a very

771
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:37,009
good degree and so they can guide that

772
00:30:33,229 --> 00:30:38,749
technology and help you access greater

773
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:40,249
you know different parts of that

774
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:41,929
technology that you wouldn't be able to

775
00:30:40,249 --> 00:30:44,419
access before so if you're with a good

776
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:46,519
shaman between you know an ayahuasca

777
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:48,799
ceremony the eCos are so powerful the

778
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:50,809
songs that they sing those songs can

779
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,639
often guide your visions and guide your

780
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:55,158
journey in certain ways that doing it on

781
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:57,619
your own could never touch I mean I'm

782
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:59,869
certain of that but you know a good

783
00:30:57,619 --> 00:31:02,059
shaman is also you know the ideal of a

784
00:30:59,869 --> 00:31:04,728
shaman is to be a hollow bone is to not

785
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:06,668
push anything forward and the shamans

786
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:08,619
who are not at

787
00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:10,899
good and not as skilled or have other

788
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:13,389
agendas they become more than that and

789
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:16,359
they start to influence you beyond that

790
00:31:13,389 --> 00:31:18,219
and then they become almost they start

791
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:21,039
to push into your field of energy rather

792
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:23,080
than just helping draw out more I mean

793
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,840
the songs really and the whole ceremony

794
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:28,689
should be designed just to maximize what

795
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,730
you can experience yourself and then

796
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:32,649
they should be an empty hollow receiver

797
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:36,119
of that not pushing out anything forward

798
00:31:32,649 --> 00:31:40,059
and the great shamans are like that now

799
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:41,499
another average random shaman you know

800
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:43,330
it may be better to do it by yourself

801
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:44,830
and I think you know one of the things

802
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:48,850
that you know there's certainly some of

803
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:51,609
them that even perhaps exacerbate the

804
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,350
fear that people have leading in you

805
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:55,539
know they can actually you know fear is

806
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:57,009
I think the ultimate virus it's a virus

807
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,809
that we catch from one another all the

808
00:31:57,009 --> 00:32:01,119
time without even realizing it and a

809
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:03,070
shaman if it's if they're not good can

810
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:05,320
actually spread that virus and create

811
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:08,109
more fear surrounding more fear of the

812
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:11,649
mythology of these different things so

813
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:14,230
you know I think it's it's a balance you

814
00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:16,988
know it's a balance between what they

815
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:18,669
can offer and then also you know is

816
00:32:16,989 --> 00:32:20,200
there a cost associated with and how

817
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:23,980
good are they how skilled are they it's

818
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,869
a technique and also you know what what

819
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:28,179
medicine you're doing I think you know

820
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:30,999
really the shaman should be kind of like

821
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:33,669
a doctor in your psychic surgery you

822
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:35,409
know and they're knowing what you know

823
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:37,509
knowing what's prescribed knowing how to

824
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:39,129
do it knowing the aftercare and just

825
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:41,320
allowing you to not worry about all that

826
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:43,389
 not have that doubt like I take too

827
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,009
much am I going to die like that I mix

828
00:32:43,389 --> 00:32:46,658
that brew right you know did I do all

829
00:32:45,009 --> 00:32:48,700
these different things all of that can

830
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:50,799
be really challenging and it's partly

831
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,080
you know the issue with most of these

832
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,029
people freaking out on bad you know bad

833
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,980
trips it's because you don't really know

834
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:58,779
if you poison yourself or not you have

835
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,789
no idea you know because you're not an

836
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:02,019
expert you're not a doctor you know so

837
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:03,519
it's just like kind of going in there

838
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:06,399
with the surgical tools and being like

839
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,649
yeah it's all right i watch youtube I

840
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,869
think it's good you know so I think

841
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:12,789
that's kind of where where my take is

842
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:14,499
but obviously you know a bad shaman is

843
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:16,658
going to be a lot worse than you know

844
00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:17,510
you with some good music sitting around

845
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:19,820
doing it

846
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:23,030
so that's kind of where my opinion is

847
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:25,899
that does that answer your question or

848
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,899
yeah

849
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:34,939
so the ever fight like consumerism like

850
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:37,130
the idea that if you buy it's like when

851
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:40,600
people buy something like the product

852
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:45,530
makes them feel good there a fight like

853
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:47,659
that like that feeling or like maybe but

854
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:50,629
going back to nature like I love when I

855
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:52,430
love running in the rain that's pretty

856
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:55,310
fun like I go and I feel like that

857
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:58,910
nature like like I just feel good I feel

858
00:33:55,310 --> 00:34:00,860
like myself and also I wanted to ask why

859
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:02,990
did you start on it like did you like

860
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,399
are you like genuinely but you seem like

861
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:07,580
you genuinely trying to help people out

862
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:10,700
so I'm sure like realizing that

863
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:14,569
consciousness is the best way to go you

864
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:16,730
know yeah I don't know if I completely

865
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:21,679
understand your your your first question

866
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:23,750
I think you know so you know I'll just

867
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,210
jump into the second one I think you

868
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:29,418
know for me on it consciousness is like

869
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:31,909
the tip of a pyramid and in order to get

870
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:33,350
escalate up that pyramid you have to

871
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:35,330
take care of some basic needs you have

872
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:37,190
to have ample energy and you have to be

873
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:39,259
out of pain if you look at any animal

874
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:41,870
when animals in pain it's the last

875
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,429
animal you want to come and hug you know

876
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:45,109
what no matter what it is it could be if

877
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:47,840
your friendliest cat but if that animal

878
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:50,510
is sick or in pain that thing's going to

879
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:53,840
hiss and lash out at you and I think all

880
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:55,310
of us most of us at least are carrying a

881
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,770
certain degree of pain and a certain

882
00:34:55,310 --> 00:35:00,259
degree of lack of energy that creates

883
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:02,660
this kind of solipsistic inward focus

884
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:04,850
you know saying that we're all we're all

885
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:07,009
in here with our dinosaur shells and

886
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:08,509
scales on like don't with me I'm

887
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:10,280
hurtin you know I'm hurting here you

888
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:11,780
don't even know like I'll kill you you

889
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,060
know and that's the attitude that we

890
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:15,950
have instead of just really opening up

891
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,170
and embracing people and so on it's a

892
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:20,660
way to take care of those basic needs

893
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:22,640
you know and then once those basic needs

894
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,290
of getting your body feeling good

895
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,210
getting your muscles working getting

896
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:28,310
everything moving in the right direction

897
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,500
once those basic needs are taken care of

898
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,250
then the rest of this stuff really has

899
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,290
fertile ground

900
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,430
because when you're really you know when

901
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:36,680
you're really in pain you don't have

902
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:38,540
energy you're sick it's super hard to

903
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,250
access your consciousness not impossible

904
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:42,370
you know certainly you can do it you can

905
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,450
do it in any search in any situation but

906
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:52,549
becomes a lot easier when everything

907
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:55,700
else is taken care okay so to follow up

908
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:56,990
on what she was asking I was wondering

909
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,850
you keep saying

910
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:01,509
shaman and I was wondering if there was

911
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:07,190
a possibility of moving beyond that

912
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:11,270
language to more you know commonalities

913
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:13,760
and more possibly a theistic language of

914
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:15,410
to where it's because I know a lot of

915
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,250
people are avoiding these experiences

916
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:21,950
because of some kind of spiritual belief

917
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:26,380
system seems to be involved when in fact

918
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:29,509
it's a personal experience and not a

919
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:31,630
religious construct so instead of a

920
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:34,070
shaman could it not just be an

921
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:36,590
experienced individual that knows how to

922
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:40,610
keep someone from choking on their own

923
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:43,610
vomit yeah you know that any sensor that

924
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:45,320
you had on tensions and will make sure

925
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,960
that you could guided with those

926
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,880
intentions if you start to go up track

927
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,860
kind of so it's a difference between a

928
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,510
guide and a shaman is kind of what

929
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,730
you're saying and and I think there's

930
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:57,290
you know a guide is or a guide or a

931
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:58,970
sitter you know a lot of times they're

932
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:00,290
just called sitters just someone with

933
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:03,410
the good heart who's just kind of

934
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:05,480
keeping it you know around you keep it

935
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:07,069
in chill making sure that you know your

936
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,320
basic needs are met and I think that's

937
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:11,870
that's cool and that's definitely an

938
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:14,660
advisor a to do it if you know if

939
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:16,609
another skilled practitioners in there

940
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:19,819
but shaman certainly isn't religious I

941
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:22,370
mean the shaman it's it's a show not

942
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:24,830
tell art you know they're not trying

943
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:26,540
religions are all the art of telling you

944
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:28,819
know they tell you these things that you

945
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:30,140
should believe and say okay this is this

946
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:32,180
is these are our beliefs I'm going to

947
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:35,690
tell you these and believe them and

948
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:38,980
whereas the shamans are like find out

949
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:40,819
for yourself you know by now for some

950
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:45,690
what

951
00:37:40,819 --> 00:37:50,009
that's not oh you're getting really

952
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:52,260
tricky now that if you're saying that

953
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:53,790
they're imposing the belief that you

954
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,260
should find things out for yourself I

955
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:57,329
think that's a very fair belief to

956
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,579
impose that's not a religion the belief

957
00:37:57,329 --> 00:38:01,410
of figured out for yourself is certainly

958
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:04,619
not a religion I don't think that falls

959
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:06,509
into the definition of religion and at

960
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:08,329
least in my definition your definition

961
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:11,099
could be different that that's cool too

962
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:12,930
but that's it's not that all shamans are

963
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:15,210
like that some shamans can get religious

964
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:16,589
you know so the word shaman can mean a

965
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,520
variety of different things and it can

966
00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:23,220
create you know certainly create issues

967
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,859
to me a good shaman is exactly that

968
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:28,049
someone who allows you to see your own

969
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:30,029
truth you know and gets out of the

970
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:32,099
 way you know that's all a good

971
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:35,160
shaman is it just get out of the way

972
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:37,200
help and remove all the obstacles so you

973
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,390
can come forward with your best truth

974
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,640
and that's really what a shaman is and

975
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:43,770
anything else you know somebody sitting

976
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,569
there you know providing the ceremony

977
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:47,430
I've had both and that's awesome like

978
00:38:45,569 --> 00:38:49,890
just someone who's just like you cool

979
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:51,569
you need some water like they're acting

980
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:53,129
as a shaman you know they're just trying

981
00:38:51,569 --> 00:38:55,230
to get out of the way they're not saying

982
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,730
like they're not trying to implant stuff

983
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:58,230
in your head or tell you anything

984
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:00,750
they're just you know that's the kind of

985
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:03,690
base level of shaman we just being empty

986
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:05,760
not putting their energy onto you and so

987
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:08,460
that is that is a shaman to a certain

988
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,470
degree and I think we mystify that term

989
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:12,930
so much and think of them like a

990
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:15,149
priestly class it's not anybody can be a

991
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:17,879
shaman you know it's just a matter of

992
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:20,250
how they're able to get their own stuff

993
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,099
out of the way that to that degree that

994
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:26,309
determines you know what level they're

995
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:27,750
at but um so to me I think that's just

996
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:30,540
the most important thing at the highest

997
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:32,220
form of the art you know they're they're

998
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,690
the emptiest person in the room and

999
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,939
that'll it really allows you to come

1000
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,650
forward to the greatest degree and I

1001
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,630
think that's that's the difference and

1002
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:42,599
also the difference between shamanism

1003
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:44,819
and religion is religion is generally

1004
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,190
you know the implanting of an idea

1005
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:49,829
whereas shamanism is you know come

1006
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:51,750
forward with your greatest truth and I

1007
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:53,900
think that's the differentiation that I

1008
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,900
ask

1009
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:00,049
so related to the idea of intentions

1010
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:02,059
like I'm wondering if you have any ideas

1011
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:04,279
about people that you care about that

1012
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:07,719
you think maybe you would benefit from

1013
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:10,670
plant medicine but obviously you know

1014
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:13,039
balancing that fine line between you

1015
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:15,469
know taking an active role in you know

1016
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:18,049
like you don't want to force someone to

1017
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:21,069
do something but kind of I guess you

1018
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:23,029
know that the the social balance of

1019
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:24,979
promoting something that you think would

1020
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:27,769
be good but not forcing it

1021
00:40:24,979 --> 00:40:30,379
yeah I've screwed that out before for

1022
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:32,209
sure screwed that up before with my

1023
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:34,519
girlfriend currently who I live with

1024
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:38,899
I was so stoked on iboga and what I was

1025
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:40,968
able to give me you know I basically

1026
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,709
strongly encourages like you got a dry

1027
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:44,509
is amazing it's going to hurt but it's

1028
00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:46,910
amazing and it was a totally shitty

1029
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:49,009
experience for her and she wouldn't have

1030
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:50,660
done that experience if I wasn't you

1031
00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:52,759
know kind of raving about what I was

1032
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:56,058
able to do and I learned to really start

1033
00:40:52,759 --> 00:40:58,130
less and I was like whoa like really

1034
00:40:56,059 --> 00:41:01,369
this thing the only thing that we can do

1035
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:03,829
is show the change and be you know

1036
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:05,119
embody what we've experienced and I

1037
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:06,619
tried the same thing with my family I

1038
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,029
tried to get my family to go down and do

1039
00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:11,479
I wast and do all this stuff until

1040
00:41:08,029 --> 00:41:14,839
finally I like just rid myself of that

1041
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:17,058
of that desire of trying to again like a

1042
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:19,699
bad shot and putting my thing on them

1043
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:22,519
and making them go do it just to really

1044
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:24,890
embody how I felt and you know tell the

1045
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:26,569
story as cleanly as possible and then

1046
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:27,618
all of a sudden they're like man we want

1047
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:31,069
to go down there and do it I was like

1048
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:33,920
whoa you know so I think the only thing

1049
00:41:31,069 --> 00:41:37,190
that you can do is just be open and just

1050
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,410
explain how that was how that affected

1051
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:40,849
you and they'll see that and if they're

1052
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:42,229
ready and if they're ready to see that

1053
00:41:40,849 --> 00:41:43,729
and they're ready for that they'll come

1054
00:41:42,229 --> 00:41:46,609
forward and they'll answer that calling

1055
00:41:43,729 --> 00:41:49,999
but anytime I've tried to like you know

1056
00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:52,009
push people into it it's been generally

1057
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:54,038
met with less than desirable results so

1058
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:57,559
I've learned kind of the hard way that

1059
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:59,420
just embody that feeling that you

1060
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:01,749
receive from these things and the people

1061
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:04,720
will come forward when they're ready

1062
00:42:01,749 --> 00:42:08,899
that it's regression

1063
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:11,709
so I've started looking into having the

1064
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:14,240
ayahuasca experience but in my research

1065
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:15,980
being a woman I've heard that's very it

1066
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,180
that's kind of especially dangerous to

1067
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:21,799
do alone but and that's maybe not the

1068
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,288
intention I have to do it alone

1069
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:27,799
however do you have any advice for

1070
00:42:23,289 --> 00:42:29,720
finding a good shaman or any tips on

1071
00:42:27,799 --> 00:42:37,809
avoiding pitfalls any comments it falls

1072
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:40,459
in yeah you know it's generally good to

1073
00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:42,079
you know get advice from people who have

1074
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,549
been there and know these different

1075
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,859
centers know the different places well

1076
00:42:43,549 --> 00:42:47,299
but it's also hard because you know it's

1077
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:49,819
hard to be fully aware of what's going

1078
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:51,349
on when the game is being played at you

1079
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:54,799
know different levels that are above

1080
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:59,029
yours you know above your awareness so

1081
00:42:54,799 --> 00:43:00,259
for me you know I've experienced a lot

1082
00:42:59,029 --> 00:43:02,240
of these different things and I'm pretty

1083
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,769
plugged in so I'm comfortable I have no

1084
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,089
financial interest in any ayahuasca

1085
00:43:03,769 --> 00:43:08,299
centers but I'm comfortable recommending

1086
00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:11,420
a few I have those on my website Aubry

1087
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:13,880
Marcus comm /faq and you can read about

1088
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:15,829
them there's about three centers or show

1089
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,029
that I can recommend or impeccable in

1090
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:19,160
that nature because you're absolutely

1091
00:43:17,029 --> 00:43:20,930
right you know you talk to somebody like

1092
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:23,000
my friend amber lyon who runs reset on

1093
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:24,740
me and she got a boob fondle the first

1094
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,809
time she was doing ayahuasca which is

1095
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:29,618
not exactly what you want to have happen

1096
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:32,210
in your first trip down to the jungle so

1097
00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:34,299
that's certainly a common story and you

1098
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:37,339
hear it all the time it's again just

1099
00:43:34,299 --> 00:43:38,990
that kind of jungle mentality of strong

1100
00:43:37,339 --> 00:43:40,490
preying on the weak and it's it's

1101
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:41,868
unfortunate but there's a couple centers

1102
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:45,169
that I can recommend that I know are

1103
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:48,970
practicing at both moral and medicinal

1104
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,970
standards so thank you

1105
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:55,510
so you've been referred to a lot of the

1106
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:57,819
plant-based medicine as technologies

1107
00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:01,390
have you actually applied other actual

1108
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:02,530
more technical approaches to achieving

1109
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,629
some of these same results like there

1110
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:07,240
are neurofeedback biofeedback facilities

1111
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:10,329
that people can go to and kind of in the

1112
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:12,009
same way be in isolation and in with

1113
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:13,300
regards to like a shaman there's you

1114
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:15,040
know people probably turning knobs

1115
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,079
behind the scenes that put you into an

1116
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,430
experience for a period of time that I

1117
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:21,150
think people come out of it with some of

1118
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:24,819
the same awareness and consciousness

1119
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:26,829
effects yeah so you know I consider

1120
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:28,300
floatation sensory deprivation one of

1121
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:30,940
those technologies certainly that

1122
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,890
doesn't occur naturally in nature I use

1123
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:35,680
the muse headband which is a portable

1124
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:38,020
EEG device that helps with biofeedback

1125
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,390
for meditation I think that's a great

1126
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:43,420
piece of technology I think I'm waiting

1127
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:46,390
for some of that kind of other more

1128
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:48,490
brute force brainwave manipulation to

1129
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:49,990
kind of flower a little a little more

1130
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:52,359
and let the research get a little more

1131
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:54,279
definite on that before I go tinkering

1132
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:56,348
in that in that way but that's just a

1133
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,730
personal preference I think if you want

1134
00:44:56,349 --> 00:44:59,170
to be on the frontier of that I think

1135
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:02,380
it's going to be very promising and

1136
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:04,420
ultimately you know manipulating our

1137
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:05,140
brainwave patterns is going to be really

1138
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,640
essential

1139
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,960
I think binaural beats is another

1140
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,940
interesting thing that I've played with

1141
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,940
which is the technology to help with

1142
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:14,260
brainwave entrainment so there's a lot

1143
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:16,839
of different things that I do play with

1144
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:19,150
but you know I'm a little scared of the

1145
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,799
kind of the brute-force methods that are

1146
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:23,530
that are still out there now and I'm

1147
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,940
going to kind of hold back I mean I'm

1148
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:26,650
still listening to Pandora I'm not even

1149
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:31,869
on Spotify yet you know I let things I

1150
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:34,420
let things you know have their time how

1151
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:37,780
are you oh you re right here cool

1152
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:40,000
hey don't Albert good um so you spoke on

1153
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,750
some of the more exotic plant medicines

1154
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,819
mmm

1155
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:46,599
my question was on the more conventional

1156
00:45:42,819 --> 00:45:50,589
one which is cannabis cannabis and magic

1157
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:53,050
mushrooms hmm with the magic mushrooms

1158
00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:59,529
I've heard Rogan talk about the heroic

1159
00:45:53,050 --> 00:46:02,710
dose and what that what he said you know

1160
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:05,140
I think people the heroic dose it's like

1161
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:07,720
it's like grand icing this

1162
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:10,089
this moved like I'm going to rip myself

1163
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:12,730
to shreds and then find me the truth

1164
00:46:10,089 --> 00:46:15,460
because I feel a totally unnecessary I

1165
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:17,740
guess it's the the concept of a heroic

1166
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,150
tale right and I'm saying I'm not saying

1167
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,430
it's a bad question I'm not saying that

1168
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:23,410
that concept I'm saying like I don't

1169
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:26,288
recommend it is what I'm saying I'm

1170
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:28,629
saying minimum effective dose you know

1171
00:46:26,289 --> 00:46:30,519
like that's how you build a hero it's

1172
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:32,319
not like throw them into the garbage

1173
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:34,089
disposal and hope they come out alive

1174
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:36,788
you know I've tried that method that

1175
00:46:34,089 --> 00:46:38,529
tries to punch and it's generally not

1176
00:46:36,789 --> 00:46:40,059
preferable to that to that minimum

1177
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:42,309
effective dose what's going to get you

1178
00:46:40,059 --> 00:46:44,140
there without without pushing you too

1179
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:46,150
far it's like any good workout you know

1180
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:48,250
like you can go to the gym and Faraj

1181
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:50,200
yourself and get rhabdo and out to sit

1182
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:51,549
out for you know three weeks after

1183
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,529
you're done because you're all up

1184
00:46:51,549 --> 00:46:55,569
and you got injuries and or you can

1185
00:46:53,529 --> 00:46:57,730
just push yourself to that point where

1186
00:46:55,569 --> 00:46:59,049
you really work in your breaking down

1187
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:00,490
muscles but your body has time to

1188
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:02,380
recover it's the same with the psyche

1189
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:04,750
you want that you want to push yourself

1190
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:06,460
of course but you want to give yourself

1191
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:09,519
enough time to recover and not let

1192
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:11,529
things get completely shook out and so I

1193
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:14,229
think the concept of heroic dose is

1194
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:16,509
problematic I think really you know you

1195
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:18,640
should you build this like you build a

1196
00:47:16,509 --> 00:47:21,490
true hero you know how is a hero built

1197
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,558
well time and time again working at his

1198
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:26,769
craft working at a skill you know

1199
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:28,569
getting better battling resistance you

1200
00:47:26,769 --> 00:47:30,490
know so I think that's that's kind of

1201
00:47:28,569 --> 00:47:33,099
the key so for me you know

1202
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:34,660
gram gram and a half of mushrooms I

1203
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:36,759
don't don't go over that you know I

1204
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:38,348
don't think that you know I don't think

1205
00:47:36,759 --> 00:47:40,720
that you need to I think you can just

1206
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:42,640
push that you know push that as much as

1207
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,230
as much as you need it I have certainly

1208
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,670
gone way over that and there is

1209
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,259
something to be said for that at the

1210
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:49,930
right time in the right place for sure

1211
00:47:47,259 --> 00:47:51,700
but but for me I think minimum effective

1212
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:53,710
dose is definitely what you're looking

1213
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:55,720
for you're going to get the best results

1214
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:57,759
whether you're working out at the gym or

1215
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,919
you're working out your psyche so that's

1216
00:47:57,759 --> 00:48:01,150
kind of my magic mushroom mushrooms are

1217
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,160
an interesting one you know there's

1218
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:04,779
certainly a strong allied for me I feel

1219
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,180
like it's there like an older brother

1220
00:48:04,779 --> 00:48:09,279
you know as some of these are like you

1221
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,720
know more like grandfathers we just sit

1222
00:48:09,279 --> 00:48:12,460
and listen to the wisdom you know

1223
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,779
mushroom you know they'll with you

1224
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:16,750
a little bit and but they'll teach you

1225
00:48:13,779 --> 00:48:18,110
some stuff and so they've been a strong

1226
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:20,150
ally for me along

1227
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:21,890
and they've taken me to some of the most

1228
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:24,950
intense experiences and some of the most

1229
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:25,819
pleasurable experiences you know and

1230
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:28,009
I've really developed a relationship

1231
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:30,770
where I feel comfortable with that

1232
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:32,870
medicine outside of kind of a shamanic

1233
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:36,980
container so it's been a real Ally for

1234
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:39,740
me certainly in that regard but you know

1235
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:41,180
it's definitely something again as long

1236
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:43,669
as you stick with minimum effective dose

1237
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:47,089
I think that's that's really really the

1238
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:49,370
way to go and then cannabis I think has

1239
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,840
a lot of you know a lot of value in a

1240
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:53,290
lot of promise as well certainly it's

1241
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,970
one of the most recreationally abused

1242
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:57,680
medicines but when you're actually you

1243
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:59,779
know using it with an intention I think

1244
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,370
for me the intention that I get out of

1245
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:03,500
cannabis is just body awareness like

1246
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:06,049
somatic awareness like if I want to

1247
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:08,510
figure out why my neck is hurting up

1248
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:10,370
here you know and I eat enough cannabis

1249
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:12,410
then I'll start to track that down I'll

1250
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:14,810
find like 10 spots in my body and just

1251
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:17,720
really kind of understand how my energy

1252
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:20,270
force is working really good for

1253
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:22,399
different things like that and also you

1254
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:23,930
know unlocking creativity in different

1255
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,690
other aspects so I'm really happy that

1256
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:30,109
the world is growing up and not throwing

1257
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:32,480
people in jail for these and when you

1258
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:35,780
use cannabis do you experience the

1259
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:39,140
paranoia that a lot of people do and

1260
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:40,850
what does that tell you about using it

1261
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:42,770
does I tell you anything or does it just

1262
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:45,500
mean useless you know it's funny like

1263
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:46,850
I've a lot of people come to me and talk

1264
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,800
to me about psychedelics and they're

1265
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:50,509
like man I don't know if I could do that

1266
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,190
because I ate too much weed once and it

1267
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:55,400
was intense it was like yeah

1268
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:57,470
weed too much wants to or more than once

1269
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,330
and it's the worst thing ever you know

1270
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:01,490
it's like eat you know when you go

1271
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:03,290
overboard on that and again you're not

1272
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:06,649
abiding by that minimum effective dose

1273
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:09,110
kind of mentality is how like it's not

1274
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:10,970
an easy ride you know certainly not it's

1275
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:12,590
not like just because this is this is

1276
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:14,660
the one that's the most legal and most

1277
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:17,300
accessible but it's like a patsy you

1278
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:18,950
know it's it's a beast you know and if

1279
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,300
you go overboard and you do too much

1280
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:22,779
you're going to have to pay the

1281
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:25,610
consequences and as far as the anxiety

1282
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:28,160
you know I'm not sure that cannabis

1283
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:30,480
creates anxiety or just reveals the

1284
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,580
anxiety that you already have inherently

1285
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,800
within you and so allowing you to work

1286
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:36,060
through it you know I'm not convinced

1287
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,490
that it's actually planting anything

1288
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:40,020
there at all it's almost like damn I've

1289
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:41,609
been anxious this whole time I've been

1290
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:44,250
paranoid this whole time now I get a

1291
00:50:41,609 --> 00:50:45,299
chance to look at it like okay well how

1292
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,850
do I get out how do I get through this

1293
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:49,830
well the anxiety is linked to a fear

1294
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:51,240
well what's the fear linked to well it

1295
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:52,290
appears linked to this and then you just

1296
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,979
start to track it all the way through

1297
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:59,730
and then you can you can work through it

1298
00:50:54,980 --> 00:51:01,920
cool okay so my Clement I'll see if I

1299
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:05,790
can write this question correctly so you

1300
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,470
seem to be very much man at peace and I

1301
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:10,050
was just wondering when you get back

1302
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:12,600
from you know these medicinal journeys

1303
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:14,340
what kind of decisions that how that

1304
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,839
influences the decisions in your life

1305
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:18,740
and how it is that you maintain the

1306
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:22,859
peace junot thing does that make sense

1307
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:24,930
yeah I mean it's so integration is a

1308
00:51:22,859 --> 00:51:27,210
really important part of these things

1309
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:30,000
that's the recovery from these these

1310
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:31,680
intense psychic workouts and again I've

1311
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,030
screwed that up a bunch of times I've

1312
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,009
jumped right back in of been in the

1313
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:36,690
jungle 16 days and like what's

1314
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:39,510
going on my company and jump back into

1315
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:41,760
14 hour days and completely fried myself

1316
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:45,000
on the way back and certainly did not

1317
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:48,180
look like a peaceful man at those points

1318
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,300
as well but you know I think the key is

1319
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:52,799
you got to realize like the extent to

1320
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,990
which like what you push yourself

1321
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,730
through and then having enough time and

1322
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:58,580
ample time to recover and kind of

1323
00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:00,780
reintegrate that's really really crucial

1324
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:03,890
otherwise things get out of balance and

1325
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:06,210
in general you know I'm constantly

1326
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:08,850
remembering and forgetting remembering

1327
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:10,920
forgetting remembering forgetting but

1328
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:12,750
each time you know I feel like the

1329
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,820
forgetting gets a little bit shorter and

1330
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:16,410
the remembering gets a little bit easier

1331
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:19,140
and the baseline starts to move

1332
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:22,170
gradually gradually so the level of you

1333
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:24,779
know the baseline level is just you know

1334
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:27,570
steadily moving and that to me is is a

1335
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:30,090
sign of optimization but at the same

1336
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:32,580
time you know the graph looks like a bad

1337
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:34,470
stock day you know I mean it's it's up

1338
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:36,420
and down all the time and I'm you know

1339
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:38,850
I'm not immune to the to the struggles

1340
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:41,100
and the franticness and the panics and

1341
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:42,990
and all of that but ultimately that base

1342
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:44,009
level of just peace and access to

1343
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:53,189
consciousness

1344
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:55,440
oh sure

1345
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:58,440
I mean my life stops constantly evolving

1346
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:01,440
I'm constantly changing the the people

1347
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:03,750
that I mean it's I don't you know I'm

1348
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,750
not someone that gets kind of stuck or

1349
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:08,790
attached to things very much so I'm just

1350
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:10,350
moving with what I think will be the

1351
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:13,380
optimal experience you know again

1352
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:15,690
seeking that that path that's going to

1353
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:18,570
bring the both to bring the best to me

1354
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:20,310
and my life so you know the more

1355
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:22,170
expansive I get it's also another

1356
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:24,660
interesting thing like you start to

1357
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:26,130
create you know energy almost gravity

1358
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:28,259
that starts to pull other like-minded

1359
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:30,630
people towards you you know the more

1360
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:34,320
that you push out this kind of message

1361
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:35,760
and it's this emanation of just the

1362
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,160
consciousness that you're accessing the

1363
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,980
more other people will kind of like and

1364
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:43,020
then you'll draw start to draw in other

1365
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,960
people along that way so I found that

1366
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:46,950
process certainly happening and

1367
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,930
certainly appreciated you know it really

1368
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:50,430
feels like the wind is at your back when

1369
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:52,379
when stuff like that's happening and

1370
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:53,850
that's great you know sometimes it feels

1371
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:56,280
like you're running uphill and a

1372
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:59,450
headwind too but you know it's part of

1373
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,450
life what makes it stronger

1374
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:06,570
Aubrey thanks a lot for bringing this

1375
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:09,900
fascinating information to us Otsuka

1376
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:11,460
I've had a the opportunity to hear you

1377
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,200
speak several times at conferences like

1378
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:16,380
this and I've tuned into a lot of your

1379
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:18,000
podcasts and I've always respected the

1380
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:20,610
the strength and courage that you've

1381
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,170
showed as such a strong advocate for

1382
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:24,930
these kinds of medicines and these

1383
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:26,790
techniques but I often also find myself

1384
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:29,730
wondering what kind of challenges you

1385
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:31,980
face personally kind of bridging these

1386
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:32,850
two worlds where like on one hand you

1387
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:35,730
know you're a very successful

1388
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:37,740
businessperson and you have a very

1389
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:40,350
public profile when it comes to that and

1390
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:43,799
yet also somehow you managed to bring

1391
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:46,560
this other more esoteric subject in and

1392
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:49,770
table that I'm wondering if you have

1393
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:52,170
advice for people about how to be a

1394
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:53,460
strong advocate for psychedelics and

1395
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:57,390
plant medicines and things like that

1396
00:54:53,460 --> 00:55:00,510
without it disrupting your professional

1397
00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:04,379
this world and things like that yeah

1398
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:07,800
well thanks have appreciate the kind

1399
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:10,050
words you know I I think to me I'm just

1400
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:14,280
committed to telling the truth and

1401
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:16,200
providing myself as a service to you

1402
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,360
know a service to as many people as

1403
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:21,240
possible and to me it just feel it would

1404
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:24,840
feel weird to succeed but hold this back

1405
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:27,450
like I have secrets these are my secrets

1406
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:29,520
you know like this has held me this has

1407
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:32,009
helped me a lot so I got to talk about

1408
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,620
it whether that hurts me or not so it's

1409
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:37,890
almost not even it's almost like not

1410
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:40,440
even a question you know like it I can't

1411
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:41,940
I can't do any other you know I have to

1412
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,160
talk about these things because that

1413
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:47,520
would violate a code that's much deeper

1414
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:49,109
and then than any of this so and I just

1415
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,120
try to tell it as straightforward as

1416
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:52,950
possible I think where a lot of people

1417
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,470
you know they they get attached to these

1418
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:57,629
things and they get you know to

1419
00:55:55,470 --> 00:56:00,509
identified with it and they push that

1420
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:02,940
out there too much you know and and so

1421
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:05,970
it becomes like I am the mystical man

1422
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:09,000
look at me mystical man you know and

1423
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:10,859
people like you you know so I think

1424
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,020
that's kind of an issue and it can go

1425
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:14,340
the other way too you know obviously you

1426
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:16,020
can be like go anything with

1427
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:18,120
spirituality you know you can there's

1428
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:19,920
disease everybody tries to identify with

1429
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,400
one thing and I just try to tell it like

1430
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,470
it is

1431
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,180
you know I've had amazing spiritual

1432
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:26,879
experiences and amazing corporeal

1433
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,950
experiences and you know I enjoy a

1434
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,030
nightclub and an ayahuasca ceremony both

1435
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:33,029
and I'm cool with that

1436
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:34,380
and I think that's you know I think that

1437
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:36,420
just really resonates with people that

1438
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:37,770
message and its really made it made it

1439
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,570
easy because I approach it from a point

1440
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:41,370
of practicality like this has helped me

1441
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:44,220
you know do you like things that help

1442
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:46,680
you or no like this is help me and you

1443
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:49,589
do it if you want yeah so I think that's

1444
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:51,870
that's pretty much it so um thank you so

1445
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:53,730
much you're welcome and I'm so glad that

1446
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:56,490
you guys had a really productive

1447
00:56:53,730 --> 00:57:00,090
discussion we need to set up for the

1448
00:56:56,490 --> 00:57:05,908
next speaker but let's give a really big

1449
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:05,909
[Applause]
