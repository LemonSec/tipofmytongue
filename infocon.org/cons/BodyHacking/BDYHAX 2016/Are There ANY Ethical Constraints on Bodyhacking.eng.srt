1
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:13,420
I'm very happy to be bringing out

2
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:15,719
Richard seen an author and commenter on

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:19,150
the challenges posed by new technologies

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:22,240
he's spoken for the NSA the FBI the

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:25,089
Department of Treasury government

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:30,038
agencies tech conferences he's a writer

7
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:32,800
wired Forbes and salon originally he

8
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,680
started out as an Episcopal priest and

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,800
one of the things I love about Richard

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,540
themes range is that he always brings in

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:46,660
a perspective that you're not expecting

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:49,810
and and his data checks out and that's a

13
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:53,860
wonderful combination from a from a

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:57,130
commenter and in this talk we'll be

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:01:00,129
we'll be hearing about the ethics of

16
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:03,670
hacking buyouts biotech bio hacking and

17
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:05,770
the freedom to live or die not every

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,810
country or person who talks the talk

19
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,908
walks the walk different rules apply

20
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:13,030
inside the national security apparatus

21
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:15,429
than they do to hump wings those who

22
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:19,630
hump along about the body of the bell

23
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:23,409
curve and I'm really looking forward to

24
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:26,199
hearing what Richard has to say about

25
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:27,939
those contradictions and the ethics of

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,560
the kind of biohacking we're talking

27
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:38,559
about this weekend a big warm welcome

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:44,619
for Richard theme thank you quit is that

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:49,869
loud enough okay it's great to be here

30
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:53,109
and it's great to be part of it did I do

31
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:55,590
that we got it down okay it's great to

32
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:59,889
be part of a conference that offers such

33
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:01,899
diverse a set of offerings because

34
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:04,990
there's nobody interested in these

35
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:06,670
subjects who could not find plenty to

36
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,829
engage with here I think I think it's

37
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,750
been wonderful I am going to talk a

38
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,769
little bit about some of the things that

39
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:15,909
can happen that make ethical issues

40
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:17,769
relevant in the first place I'm going to

41
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:19,569
start with that I mean the first I guess

42
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:20,950
is is my example

43
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:24,310
you can see I'm wearing a brace on my

44
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:26,888
wrist and this is testimony to some of

45
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,269
the dangers of an uninformed approach to

46
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:31,150
certain technologies that have become

47
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:34,510
embedded in our lives if you simply use

48
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:38,560
them without thinking how many people

49
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:40,480
have seen Breaking Bad most most of you

50
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,969
Breaking Bad is terrific

51
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,980
right and when we watched it the first

52
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:47,168
time we're just enthralled and pretty

53
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,060
much binge watched it and then after

54
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:51,639
many months had passed I wondered how it

55
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,590
would go to look at it again and I start

56
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,180
watching it on my iPad and I got caught

57
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,310
up in it again and watched two or three

58
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,709
at a time before I went to sleep which I

59
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,510
know now you're not supposed to do and I

60
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:03,519
didn't even think about the fact that I

61
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,969
was holding my iPad like this for two to

62
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:11,230
three hours so the lesson I learned from

63
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:13,418
that is rested on a pillow do not hold

64
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,540
it up like this for a prolonged period

65
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:20,819
of time so unintentionally the

66
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:25,599
technologies can can come into our lives

67
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:27,810
not every country not every person talks

68
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,869
the ethical talk we hear in this country

69
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:34,900
it is two-edged sword it both keeps us

70
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,939
on the path we want to say we are on but

71
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,459
it also puts as it puts us at a

72
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:40,629
competitive disadvantage in people that

73
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:42,189
I talked to in the intelligence

74
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:45,310
community are very very concerned about

75
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:47,470
that they know that other people are

76
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:51,280
doing everything they can to advance the

77
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:54,370
technologies in the various ways and so

78
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,609
we have to talk about what ethics really

79
00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:01,599
means in the world in relationship to

80
00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:04,959
these topics really ethics is just

81
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:08,369
thinking about together what's the best

82
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:12,579
thing to do what's the right thing to do

83
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:14,620
and what's the fun thing to do and how

84
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:16,810
is it that we can go off the tracks

85
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,780
some people think of ethics in a rigid

86
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:22,000
black-and-white rule-based way I'll say

87
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:22,960
a lot about that a little a little later

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,020
for a good reason

89
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,180
that's where beginners do begin thinking

90
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,859
about how to live their lives with a set

91
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,860
of rules that they're given like we were

92
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,400
in kindergarten but that's not where

93
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,860
real

94
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,169
experts at ethics live their lives and

95
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,970
it's not where I hope you will live your

96
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:42,549
life I'm going to try to provide a

97
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:47,020
program or a way a framework to

98
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:49,150
understand how you can become expert at

99
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,680
ethical decisions in other words I'm not

100
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,960
going to give you a set of rules I'm

101
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,949
going to give you a template for an

102
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:00,008
ongoing modification and sustaining and

103
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:03,460
nurturing of your own journey so that

104
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:05,470
you become expert intuitively at knowing

105
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,109
what is the right thing to do because

106
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,750
that's what it's all about to wind up at

107
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:13,180
the ability to know how and know that

108
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,210
you know how to make the right decisions

109
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:19,240
in life we call it maturity and if we

110
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:21,760
don't do it we can go off this is a

111
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,620
mobius strip this is a object which you

112
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,900
know looks like it has two sides but it

113
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,849
only has one side and that is the

114
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,650
challenge that faces us in all the

115
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:34,990
discussions we've heard for these two

116
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:37,690
days here we are these agents exercising

117
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:40,240
what we used to call free agency for

118
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,219
thinking about and implementing all of

119
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,979
these ideas about how to change

120
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,680
ourselves into the future but when we

121
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:49,870
come back to the decision-making process

122
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,080
we find that the very thing we are

123
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,880
altering is the very self that is making

124
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,460
those decisions in other words there's

125
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,889
only one side for this we set out as if

126
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,260
we are separate from our bodies which is

127
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:04,780
of course not true our body brain is the

128
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:07,090
single organic unity we are one thing

129
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,119
and we have what some call the illusion

130
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:12,039
of freedom of action because we know

131
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,750
that unconscious processes generate

132
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,669
action prior to the conscious mind

133
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,919
becoming aware that it's making what we

134
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:20,139
used to call a choice and this makes the

135
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,330
discussion of ethics very very difficult

136
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:25,120
and it makes a lot of the statements we

137
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:28,030
make paradoxical I did a speech in

138
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,130
Canada two weeks ago for the 17th annual

139
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,138
privacy and security conference for

140
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,789
primarily the government and some

141
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:36,669
corporation and I made the statement

142
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:40,150
that the weakest link in discussions of

143
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:42,250
privacy is the definition of privacy and

144
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,590
the definition of privacy is no longer

145
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,120
what we think it is and the reason is no

146
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,200
longer what we think it is is because

147
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,330
the very self the

148
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,090
individual human being who was

149
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,430
contextualized by prior technologies is

150
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,320
no longer the self that we are and

151
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,100
certainly not the self that we have

152
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,750
discussed enhancing augmenting and

153
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,990
transforming into a different kind of

154
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,390
human species or at least variety in the

155
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:09,280
future and therefore this is very

156
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,349
paradoxical and very tricky to talk

157
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,530
about because literally the language we

158
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:17,980
want to use for ethics which came from

159
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:20,919
originally our religious narratives has

160
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,780
to be reformulated in light of who we

161
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,390
really are and what we are really able

162
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,710
to do and are doing now and if we don't

163
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:29,560
do that we're using twentieth-century

164
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,979
language or 19th century language or in

165
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:36,130
some cases 16th century language or

166
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:39,160
Stone Age or Bronze Age language to try

167
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:43,930
to describe what is no longer really

168
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:46,180
appropriate for us so we we can do a lot

169
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,620
of things but we should really think

170
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:53,230
seriously about what it is we want to do

171
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:57,880
here you're looking at an RFID implant

172
00:07:53,230 --> 00:08:00,460
and you heard a mall a mountain open

173
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,320
doors leap tall buildings in a single

174
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:07,030
bound do all sorts of things with the

175
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:10,210
RFID chips that are in his hands he was

176
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:12,700
on the panel in Canada as well but

177
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,859
somebody else on the panel a PhD student

178
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:18,490
at the University of Victoria questions

179
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:22,330
whether or not there's this overriding

180
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:26,830
purpose for implanting the RFID implants

181
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:29,050
at this point that comes out of the

182
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,090
quantified self-movement as does I don't

183
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:35,700
have a picture of it but butter mind

184
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:39,610
self seth roberts you may know about him

185
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,560
he thought lipids excessive amounts of

186
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,930
lipids were key to an agile mind and

187
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:45,969
he's called butter mind because he ate

188
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:50,469
half a stick of butter for breakfast

189
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:51,610
every day he died of a heart attack it

190
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,140
might have been from eating all those

191
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,750
lipids it might have been from a

192
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,610
congenital defect of his heart i don't

193
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,209
know and i don't know any autopsy

194
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,569
results

195
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:04,628
but the point is it points to personal

196
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:07,170
risk you had better not trust the

197
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:10,059
paternalistic medical system exclusively

198
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,979
but you had better learn to trust your

199
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:14,050
own better judgment when you're

200
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,269
evaluating these things it is completely

201
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,429
your right to do whatever you choose to

202
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:20,439
do with your body but you are

203
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:20,980
responsible for what you do with your

204
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:22,629
body

205
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,050
and the sometimes unintended

206
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:28,480
consequences so accepting rights means

207
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:32,229
accepting responsibility for making

208
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,689
those choices somebody else is giving

209
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,369
themselves infusions of vitamin A - as

210
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:39,399
opposed to vitamin A one because they

211
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:41,559
want to develop an ability to see

212
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:44,290
infrared and they believe that that's a

213
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:46,929
factor that will enhance it my

214
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:49,779
understanding based on simply testimony

215
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:51,339
to that is that it may be making some of

216
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:53,110
a difference something of a difference

217
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:56,649
in that way already

218
00:09:53,110 --> 00:10:01,059
but what is it doing to someone's vision

219
00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:04,240
to play with one's eyes will it hurt

220
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:07,360
will it degrade the ability to see going

221
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,819
forward we don't know long-term studies

222
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,759
are needed in order to know what we

223
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:14,829
don't know so whether it's an RFID

224
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,990
implant you are eating a stick of butter

225
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:19,839
every day for breakfast or giving

226
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,910
yourself vitamin A - we just don't know

227
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,019
where it's going to lead on the other

228
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,110
hand there are things that seem

229
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:28,379
relatively benign this is north paw many

230
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:31,389
of you are familiar with that North paw

231
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:33,490
sense bridge dotnet project slash North

232
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:36,879
paw is where you learn more about it

233
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:39,309
it's magnets and a buzzer and it comes

234
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:41,559
from the studies done by people at the

235
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:45,219
University of Wisconsin a number of

236
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:47,980
years ago called the the feel safe feel

237
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,980
sense belt where magnets were implanted

238
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,589
and then directly connected to neuronal

239
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,660
system that hijacked the pathways

240
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:58,629
developed by our evolution in the brain

241
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,360
for something else to take the detection

242
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:03,519
of the Earth's magnetic field directly

243
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,139
into the brain and the person who

244
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,110
volunteered for that experiment

245
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:10,269
developed for six months a very acute

246
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,310
ability to know always where true north

247
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:14,100
was

248
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:16,229
it seemed astonishing at the time to

249
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,900
emulate what pigeons and the light could

250
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,190
do but now North paw makes this

251
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,560
available and there are other kinds of

252
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,600
things you can wear to detect the

253
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,300
Earth's magnetic field and the buzzers

254
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:30,270
enable you to learn over time by

255
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,949
training your brain what it is you're

256
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,960
picking up and I wanted to say something

257
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,810
about that briefly because you cannot

258
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:40,350
overemphasize the degree of cooperation

259
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:44,040
you have to give to your brain almost as

260
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:47,040
if it is a partner in this you know in

261
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,380
light of colorblindness that many women

262
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,719
about 20% have an additional chromosome

263
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:56,880
which enhances their ability to see more

264
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:58,680
colors than normals can see but one

265
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,110
woman in particular when she discovered

266
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,120
that she had disability and told people

267
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:05,490
about it was told she was imagining it

268
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,380
that couldn't be true what happens when

269
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,250
people tell us that even when it's

270
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:13,200
innately available to us by genetics

271
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:15,000
people stop believing that they have the

272
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,950
capacity and just as the only way you

273
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,670
can really take personal power away from

274
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,620
someone

275
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,479
it's convinced them they don't have it

276
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,530
so they don't exercise it

277
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,940
that's what abuse is and does but

278
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:29,760
intrinsic to the human condition is

279
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:32,880
freedom to act and the power to act and

280
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,589
if intrinsic to your genetic code is the

281
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,439
ability to see more colors than anyone

282
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:39,570
else can see and you know it and believe

283
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,300
it and then cooperate with what you have

284
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:44,400
been given to develop it then you

285
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,439
enhance by virtue of your choice and

286
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,180
freedom and own intentionality your

287
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,680
ability to see those colors more and

288
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,229
more clearly more and more distinctly

289
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,109
and to use what now is a gift rather

290
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:57,570
than an imaginative something you made

291
00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:00,660
up so it's important to know that when

292
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,260
you do put these things whatever they

293
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,900
may be

294
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,569
whether genetically or enhancements onto

295
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,819
our into yourself that if your brain can

296
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,709
pick it up you have an obligation based

297
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,110
on your prefrontal cortex which is your

298
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:16,020
executive function to work with that

299
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:18,089
part of the brain that is doing it so

300
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,270
that you will enhance your ability to

301
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:23,070
continue to do it so North paw is a good

302
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:25,079
thing if you want to know where the

303
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,360
magnetic field is

304
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,180
F MRIs have been used for neurofeedback

305
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,400
for chronic pain patients and they

306
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,620
learned they can train themselves not to

307
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:38,040
need opiates anymore using that feedback

308
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,600
mechanism and open BCI which we've had

309
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,540
great presentations on here at the

310
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,840
conference electroencephalography and

311
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:49,589
there are feedback can allow you to

312
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:52,590
control or enable alpha wave meditation

313
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:54,930
States much more easily and that's a

314
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:56,820
safe way to use it but you can also use

315
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,829
that feedback loop to reward thought

316
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,140
patterns which are deaf arias or

317
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:04,050
negative for yourself and can have

318
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,300
serious psychological impacts so the

319
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:12,180
same thing can be used positively or

320
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:14,250
negatively the location that you

321
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,380
stimulate in the brain when you're using

322
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:20,250
things like transcranial direct

323
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:22,260
stimulation TDC yes using just some

324
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:25,800
circuitry in Satellite soak pads in the

325
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:28,680
battery it's all it takes some people

326
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,660
from they had to withdraw from the use

327
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,209
of that technology as they did from a

328
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,730
drug and the location the stimulate is

329
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:37,620
critical but we don't know yet and what

330
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,570
we are stimulated we are stimulating

331
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:43,320
something in the brain but we don't

332
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:45,600
really know what so the risk can be said

333
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,360
as it's easy to fool yourself as a human

334
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,370
and believe what we want to believe but

335
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,420
these issues are much more complex than

336
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:56,130
we thought now different places allow us

337
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,380
to do different things

338
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:01,620
Neuromancer style you can go to Chiba

339
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:04,650
City near Tokyo and get McCoy Pauley

340
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:08,430
also aka the flatline inserted in your

341
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:11,069
head and a chip but before you do that

342
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:13,290
you have to find out what's legal and if

343
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,690
what you are doing is not legal then you

344
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:17,459
have to wait consequences of trying

345
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:20,090
something that results in something

346
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:23,940
negative excuse me

347
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:26,340
synthetic biology as obvious risks and

348
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:29,250
benefits and different cultures

349
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:32,700
recognize that differently in Europe you

350
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:35,880
need a transformation license to do even

351
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,770
simple risk-free lab experiments in

352
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,920
North America the regulations are much

353
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,720
more permissive

354
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,610
so there's a societal advantage in

355
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,949
advancing the state of education and

356
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:49,279
allowing inform discussions about

357
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:51,290
genetic engineering the previous speaker

358
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,600
did not want to get into politics and

359
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,130
especially religious politics but I'm

360
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,449
gonna go back to a great scientist

361
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,699
hundreds of years ago who when the

362
00:15:56,449 --> 00:16:00,829
church told him he shouldn't dissect

363
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:02,630
cadavers which he wanted to do in order

364
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:05,388
to discover human anatomy in order to do

365
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:09,980
medicine he said anything that deserves

366
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:11,600
to exist deserves to be known and the

367
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,190
same is true of course a stem cell

368
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,449
research and all the other things that

369
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:20,329
rigid frightened rigidly righteous

370
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:23,209
people a try on behalf of what they

371
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:27,138
believe is the general good to keep all

372
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:29,420
of us from doing for the benefit of all

373
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:32,360
of us I don't think it's much of a limb

374
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:35,240
to go out and say that rigidly righteous

375
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,870
people I learned in the ministry are the

376
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,519
worst problem for ministers encouraging

377
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,380
because they present a schema that's

378
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:45,069
inviolable that's absolute that's

379
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:51,050
totalitarian out of their fear-based

380
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:52,519
need to control so different cultures

381
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:56,569
will manifest that different ways

382
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:59,720
politically and then there's what other

383
00:16:56,569 --> 00:17:02,660
cultures do with this data Beijing is

384
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,220
doing human genetic enhancement we've

385
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,599
got two problems with that one is

386
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,780
they're doing things that we would never

387
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:12,049
allow to be done here never on the other

388
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,539
hand they lie a lot so we don't know

389
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:17,209
exactly what's real they claim that the

390
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:18,859
Beijing genomics Institute is learning

391
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:21,039
about the genetics of intelligence when

392
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:25,309
we say it's in now genomics Institute

393
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:28,369
think whole cities dedicated to that

394
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:31,580
task and consisting of nothing but

395
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:33,110
people who are doing that task so they

396
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,270
claim that within five years they'll be

397
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:38,030
able to engineer babies with an IQ of

398
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:39,500
300 they say there are about a hundred

399
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,230
different genetic factors they've been

400
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,770
able to recognize and by doing genetic

401
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:47,419
engineering appropriately we can enhance

402
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:50,750
IQs up to three hundred some claimed

403
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:52,400
four hundred four hundred and fifty in

404
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,860
North America we have a martyr

405
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,630
Miriam proposed on germline

406
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:59,689
modifications so will our unenhanced

407
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:02,030
humans here the next generation remain

408
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,510
competitive if the Chinese in fact do

409
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,670
that

410
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,290
my best sources in the intelligence

411
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:08,810
community tell me they will not achieve

412
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:11,210
that that they may very well within

413
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:14,030
maybe ten years be able to enhance

414
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:15,830
intelligence by genetic engineering but

415
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,300
they will also develop and I won't go

416
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,159
into the details but they'll also

417
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,770
develop cancers that will mean they were

418
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:26,540
dead on the table by the time they are

419
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:29,210
in late adolescence so I'll think of Roy

420
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:33,110
the replicant asking Tyrell and Blade

421
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:35,720
Runner for the changes he wanted made to

422
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:38,659
his genetic structure so that he could

423
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,450
have more height and he said gives rise

424
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,700
to recant the recombinant DNA gives rise

425
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,500
to a mutation the patient is dead before

426
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:48,140
they can get off the table it's like

427
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,510
that if you are in a culture in a

428
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:53,510
political context that is willing to

429
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:56,240
sacrifice individuals in order to find

430
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:59,090
out how to do that best and who discards

431
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,660
the pride byproducts of failed

432
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:05,000
experiments you will learn faster but at

433
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:08,510
a cost that in our culture we don't

434
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,530
believe is an acceptable cost so they

435
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:14,090
say these hundred genes most relevant if

436
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,920
they all point in the right direction

437
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,800
will lead to another generation of

438
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,480
Chinese three times smarter than us they

439
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,129
don't have any moratorium on that

440
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,600
research but they also have to wait a

441
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:26,120
generation to see if it's true

442
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,010
intelligence is a very difficult thing

443
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,870
we use the word as if we all share an

444
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:32,330
understanding of what that means but it

445
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:34,250
means many different things and again my

446
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:36,679
resources tell me that a hundred is

447
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,360
probably alight in terms of all of the

448
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:41,840
factors in the brain and in the genome

449
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:44,090
that affect it so you want to do your

450
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,199
homework when you hear these claims you

451
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,060
want to do your homework when

452
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,460
advertising and marketing presents

453
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,860
products and processes that claim to do

454
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,590
astonishing things simply if it seems

455
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:58,060
too good to be true this is an old man

456
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,060
speaking it usually is

457
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:06,260
now this is a gentleman we heard

458
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:07,100
yesterday Ariel who injected chlorophyll

459
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,710
eyedrops

460
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:12,620
in an attempt to enhance his night

461
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:15,620
vision to enhance his ability to see in

462
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:18,530
effect an infrared that's how he looks

463
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:22,070
with chlorophyll enhanced eyes pretty

464
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:24,740
green the question it raises is what

465
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:27,290
else are you doing to your eyes above

466
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,610
all do you know what you are doing to

467
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:30,860
your eyes so there are things we can

468
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:34,610
experiment with but we don't know what

469
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:37,790
the results are gonna be here are here's

470
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:40,850
a slide showing you two monkeys that are

471
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:43,340
going to undergo a head transplant we

472
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:46,399
are doing that as we humans are now

473
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,559
doing in some places um head transplants

474
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,320
you take the head of one monkey and you

475
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,850
put it on the other a doctor in italy

476
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,000
claimed that within two years he'll be

477
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:58,750
able to do this for human beings i think

478
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,970
it raises some some questions for us

479
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:04,160
there is a mouse ready to undergo a head

480
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,590
transplant he's obviously been sedated

481
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,840
no animals were hurt during the process

482
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:12,530
of this operation except of course the

483
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:14,990
mouse from who the head was donated and

484
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:16,940
that's what he looks like afterward you

485
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:20,110
see a white mouse with the head of a

486
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:24,980
black mouse now here's something amazing

487
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:28,129
using the equivalent of fMRI and senses

488
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:30,020
sensory data they were able to determine

489
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:33,500
when the mouse woke up from the

490
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:35,750
transplant what thought if you can call

491
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,000
it a thought in a mouse brain he was

492
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,860
actually thinking say he because it was

493
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,980
a male Mouse and they were able to

494
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:47,959
codify that like this that's what the

495
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:50,330
mouse was thinking so know this stuff is

496
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,010
really pretty exciting when you talk

497
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,540
about head transplants this is the way

498
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,190
it looked in a science-fiction movie and

499
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:58,159
you can see that this lovely woman is

500
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:59,570
not minding at all that her head is

501
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,950
about to be removed or replaced with

502
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,870
another or maybe she is the donor I

503
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:05,780
don't remember the movie that well who

504
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:08,870
sees these Ed Wood movies anymore

505
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:11,059
but she's happy but I need to show you

506
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,000
what it really looks like when you wake

507
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:15,600
up from a head trip

508
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,880
plant it's kind of like that so that's

509
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,120
how it can really feel that's that's too

510
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:24,660
bad to leave on the screen I'm not

511
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,540
supposed to go back no those are

512
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,730
supposed to go back there we go there

513
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,710
I'll stay with a pleasant image rather

514
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:34,920
than unpleasant one for a minute while I

515
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:38,580
continue so the promise is great right

516
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:41,040
cybernetics from directions sensing to

517
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,110
perfect pitch to memory using

518
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,510
cloud-based memory to enhance our own to

519
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:48,419
distributed cognition that promises to

520
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:50,190
enhance us all in on musk who takes a

521
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,410
lot of risks donated ten million for the

522
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:54,330
future of life Institute to ensure that

523
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:57,000
AI is developed that doesn't threaten

524
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,620
humanity but we don't know the dividing

525
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,780
line between the artificial and simply

526
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:05,040
enhanced remain clear I will add that my

527
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:08,280
sources it's at CI a gentleman talk to

528
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,379
and somebody of NSA about this said that

529
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,840
they think long long before we enhance

530
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,840
intelligence successfully by genetic

531
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:17,730
modification AI will have done the

532
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,709
enhancement for us that the machines are

533
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:22,290
going to be moving a lot lot faster and

534
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:24,030
we are cyborgs in in our relationship to

535
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:26,010
the machines so what does it matter

536
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,750
whether you're enhanced or a cyborg or

537
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,270
quote artificial these are all

538
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:32,670
differently sentient creatures I like

539
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:35,610
that term differently sentient creatures

540
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,350
and the distinctions will blur the legal

541
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:40,409
issues will ask for clarity and we never

542
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:42,600
get it not for a long long time if ever

543
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:44,190
way back in the Clinton administration I

544
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,929
was asked to speak to the senior lawyers

545
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,420
at the Department of the Treasury on

546
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:51,060
what the internet and various technology

547
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,910
is related to it we're going to do to

548
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,710
the distinctions they'd like to make and

549
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:57,570
in effect I addressed the fact that the

550
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:02,580
precedents on which they relied were no

551
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:05,689
longer relevant laws like ethics always

552
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:09,149
come later we discover what we can do

553
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:11,580
somebody somewhere doesn't then the

554
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:14,190
ethical conversation takes place and by

555
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,810
that time the horse is usually out of

556
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:19,950
the barn the privacy conference you

557
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:23,220
could say I could say quite clearly and

558
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:25,720
sincerely the level of abstraction of

559
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:28,330
data at which you are able to look

560
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,700
nealy determines what you think is real

561
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:33,850
and that's where we have this kind of

562
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:37,080
silly term metadata which is data but

563
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:40,959
it's not data as presented by studies or

564
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:44,260
sensors it is data extracted by mining

565
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,570
and patterns searching at a higher level

566
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:48,730
of abstraction that will not resemble

567
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:51,909
the results of the data at the lower

568
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:53,710
level and if people don't see that level

569
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:57,310
of distraction clearly right in front of

570
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:59,230
them they literally see a different

571
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,940
level of reality than other people see

572
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:05,260
and they so they use the word data and

573
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:09,580
metadata but it's it's all data and as

574
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:12,370
this emerges what we call metadata is

575
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:15,189
now producing identifiable clusters of

576
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:18,429
attributes of us that mean we are much

577
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:21,100
more better known by others than we know

578
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:23,050
ourselves because they can see and

579
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,179
anticipate our behaviors based on prior

580
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:27,820
patterns and I won't go in all the

581
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:31,360
details that's a wonderful exploratory

582
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:33,100
talk because it's not science fiction it

583
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,020
is something we are living and the

584
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,389
secret to its success is to keep it

585
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:41,800
hidden behind the veil so when you click

586
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:44,710
like etc etc as you know it enables you

587
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,899
to be known so one of the other places

588
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,800
this is going is organic computing

589
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:52,480
you're looking at four floor rats there

590
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:56,250
and you're looking at some of the data

591
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,330
and results based on what they're

592
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:00,880
extrapolating but what we've got is for

593
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:02,590
rats whose brains are all connected to

594
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,490
each other we call this an organic

595
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,679
computer

596
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:08,260
it's like parallel processing but it's

597
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:10,060
using brains and just as the brains of a

598
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,530
human in the brains of a computer are in

599
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:14,020
a cyborg Ian's relationship we're

600
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:17,379
symbiotic relationship that enables a

601
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:20,740
human or a monkey at a monitor in Austin

602
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:23,920
to press a button and a monkey or a

603
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:26,380
human in Tokyo will lift its arm as an

604
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:30,940
unconscious response the generation of

605
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:32,410
that circuit is the distinctions need to

606
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,120
be made more clear just as the

607
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:37,740
distinctions between artificial and

608
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:42,070
natural no longer home

609
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:44,830
they just don't so where do we begin

610
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:46,540
with ethics this is the present part of

611
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:48,580
the presentation that is saying this is

612
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:50,860
what's going on now I want to say I'm

613
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:54,340
supposed to talk about ethics well what

614
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:57,659
is ethics Albert Schweitzer famously

615
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:59,409
said once ethics is reverence for life

616
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,110
reverence for life

617
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:04,809
how does they manifest in a hacking

618
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:08,290
context for hackers reverence reverence

619
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:10,840
itself is expressed by engaging with

620
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:11,860
life in the exploratory playful and

621
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,470
creative way

622
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:17,830
creativity often bypasses for the moment

623
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:21,600
at least the prefrontal cortex which

624
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:21,600
says wait a minute stop don't do that

625
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:25,929
now creativity finds ways to

626
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:29,440
spontaneously manifest from other parts

627
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:32,410
of the brain and hackers want to make

628
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,020
something new out of something else they

629
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:37,690
want to redesign or reconfigure a new

630
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,520
something which is not inherent in that

631
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,780
something else which was built by an

632
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,379
engineer or someone for a different

633
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,450
purpose

634
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:45,640
well computer hacking takes an

635
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:47,080
information machine and makes it do

636
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,380
things the creator may never have

637
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,970
intended you all know that story by now

638
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,610
but biohacking takes something that's

639
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:57,100
already a kludge something that

640
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:59,610
evolution itself has enabled to come

641
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:03,100
into being and how does evolution work

642
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:05,889
evolution is not purposeful in the way

643
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,480
that we like to think it uses the parts

644
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:11,260
that are available and that's one of the

645
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,970
reasons our bodies have become using

646
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:16,510
available materials in parts already

647
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:18,940
evolved what they are and some of that

648
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:22,360
has problems because we walk upright

649
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:24,549
this way and lost our boreal origins we

650
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,129
have back problems because our lower

651
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:29,559
backs were not made to support with what

652
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:31,929
we do with them and we can go on and on

653
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:34,990
about the clutches of evolution that had

654
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:36,790
enough upsides walking upright binocular

655
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:39,910
vision seeing animals in the distance on

656
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:42,250
the savanna etc to counteract the

657
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,940
downsides if oh my back oh my aching

658
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:48,309
back

659
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:50,350
so that's the way evolution works think

660
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:52,300
of the scene in Apollo 13

661
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:54,370
remember when they were stuck trying to

662
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:57,250
come back and the oxygen level and the

663
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:59,830
cabin was going down and at NASA they

664
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:01,930
took all of the available parts that

665
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:04,210
were available on the Apollo 13 module

666
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:06,760
and they dumped it under the table and

667
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,500
all his pieces came out and he said this

668
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,390
is what they've got this is what we've

669
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,850
got to work with we have to make a

670
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:16,210
kludge using the available parts and

671
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:18,219
pieces to scrub the atmosphere so the

672
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,830
oxygen level goes up so they won't all

673
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:23,170
die in a tin can headed home and they

674
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:26,110
did well that's the way evolution works

675
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:28,240
as well it dumps the parts on a table it

676
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:30,129
looks at them and it says well this

677
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,310
might not be perfectly designed for

678
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:35,860
doing X or Y but maybe it can do it

679
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:38,800
that's how evolution works and the

680
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:42,100
available result at the moment and in

681
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,930
transition is us we are very provincial

682
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,939
and we think that who we have become and

683
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:48,910
who we are is what will stay ourselves

684
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:51,430
for some time but already the water is

685
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:53,710
rising the waters of transformation and

686
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:56,470
we are already on our way to becoming

687
00:29:53,710 --> 00:30:00,040
something else the gene pool of humanity

688
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:02,940
already contains billions of mutations

689
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:05,710
some of which will manifest in perhaps

690
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,930
x-men and I'll say on the side I said

691
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:10,150
long ago science fiction is how left

692
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:14,050
brain our engineering society dreams of

693
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:16,090
the future and I often wondered well who

694
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:17,919
are the x-men why are they so prominent

695
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:19,990
in consciousness now why are their

696
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,930
movies so popular and it's because

697
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:25,840
mutants with superpowers are exactly

698
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:27,250
what this conference is about and it

699
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,709
raises some of the social issues

700
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:33,460
associated with those emergent

701
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:35,530
properties as well so evolution cuts

702
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:38,650
corners all the time it tries new things

703
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:40,870
all the time it's roulette wheel and you

704
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:43,240
never know where the wheel is the ball

705
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:45,669
is going to drop it keeps things that

706
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,850
more or less work and what doesn't work

707
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:51,130
dies and it gets rid of it because it's

708
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:53,490
slower or it's dumber or it gets eaten

709
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:56,590
and therefore it's out of the gene pool

710
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:59,470
one of the problems we have in the

711
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:01,830
political system is manifesting this

712
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:03,650
currently I'm not choosing sides I'm

713
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:06,169
simply saying that

714
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:08,240
obviously a lot of people have remained

715
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:10,940
in the gene pool due to advances in

716
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,780
technology that long ago would have been

717
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:22,309
selected out and discarded and and they

718
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:24,740
vote but the corollary to that is if

719
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:28,399
voting mattered you know they wouldn't

720
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:31,040
let us do it so there's that - then on

721
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,860
top of it but that's an editorial aside

722
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:36,230
let me continue in other words evolution

723
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:38,419
is a hacker now if you want to call it

724
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:40,160
God I don't acquire you to use the

725
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,309
language which once was familiar to me

726
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,270
in my context as a religious person

727
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:46,879
institutionally I don't care what

728
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:51,460
language you use just know that there is

729
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:53,990
an overarching process underway and

730
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:56,030
evolution is a hacker and if you want to

731
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:58,130
call the source of intelligence behind a

732
00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:00,740
god then you have to admit that the way

733
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:04,220
God seems to work things out is like a

734
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:07,130
hacker in other words making a lot of

735
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:10,250
stuff up recreating and recombining

736
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:12,679
possible forms all the time some of

737
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:14,840
which seem to last like dinosaurs for

738
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:18,590
millions of years before the earth

739
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:20,809
decides it can handle their exclusion in

740
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:23,689
order to make way for the little lemurs

741
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:25,760
that became us the little mammals that

742
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:27,860
needed the dinosaurs to get out of the

743
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,170
way that doesn't mean they got out of

744
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:33,559
the way so we could advance it means

745
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:36,740
they got out of the way and we replaced

746
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:38,840
them and took the niche so that's a way

747
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:41,179
of saying quite seriously that reverence

748
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,309
for life is not being bowing down before

749
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:45,650
it it means engaging with it the way God

750
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:47,928
or evolution engages with the universe

751
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,350
through trial and error keeping what

752
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:50,720
works

753
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:53,330
throwing away with dozen sewing lots and

754
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,059
lots of seeds what grows nurture and

755
00:32:53,330 --> 00:33:00,139
prune what doesn't POW under that's

756
00:32:56,059 --> 00:33:01,010
reality so ethics is always opposed to

757
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:04,270
self-interest

758
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:07,309
why because ethics is about the other

759
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:09,170
ethics isn't not only what doing for

760
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:10,970
yourself is good what is good for

761
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:14,000
yourself but what is good for the other

762
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:17,390
but like that mobius strip suggested

763
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,330
the self and the other in this case are

764
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:24,110
the same because the other you are

765
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:26,300
trying to design enhancer augment is the

766
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:28,100
future self that will no longer be the

767
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,379
self that is making the decisions here

768
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:32,149
and now on the basis of imperfect

769
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,740
knowledge and that leads to I'm going to

770
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:36,130
give you two rules for ethics in the

771
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:39,050
courses talk and the first one is

772
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:41,840
obviously self defeating really stupid

773
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:44,450
things are unethical and as a wise man

774
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:48,379
said life is very hard but it's a lot

775
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:52,430
harder if you're stupid so the first

776
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:55,280
rule don't be stupid don't be stupid

777
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:56,930
now this has a course some prior states

778
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,120
and consciousness and awareness that are

779
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:00,740
required you have to know that you are

780
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,270
stupid and an awful lot of stupid people

781
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:05,180
don't know they're stupid and therefore

782
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:07,850
they do stupid things but that means ask

783
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,620
somebody now that requires certain

784
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:12,230
degree of humility and awareness to know

785
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:14,509
that you don't know there are unknown

786
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:16,820
unknowns about what you want to do is

787
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:19,790
rumsfeld said and there are other people

788
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:22,340
always around us who are wiser and

789
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:24,350
smarter than us or more mature so what

790
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:26,030
we engage with them in the religious

791
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:28,159
world we call it spear of the spiritual

792
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:30,320
direction call it therapy and call it a

793
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,629
spiritual companion but it means you

794
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,370
can't always make these decisions alone

795
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:36,200
and if you know that you don't know

796
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:38,480
which is already an advanced condition

797
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,549
of awareness then you engage other

798
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,530
people who are smarter than you what am

799
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:45,320
i describing you should recognize the

800
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:47,150
hacker meritocracy in this i remember

801
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:51,410
people staying up all night on the floor

802
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:52,700
Barnes and Noble or boarders which some

803
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:55,279
of you were too young to know used to be

804
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:57,290
a bookstore and they would stay up all

805
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,210
night with all the O'Reilly books going

806
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:00,950
over all the details they could learning

807
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,930
learning learning if they were true

808
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:06,500
hackers when they went online into a

809
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:08,350
news group then or a list you ask

810
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,420
questions with humility and deference

811
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:13,339
showing respect for your elders and if

812
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:15,350
they got from your question that you had

813
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:17,510
done all the homework you could do prior

814
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:19,100
to coming to them rather than writing a

815
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:22,340
question that I still get sometimes but

816
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:25,940
can you teach me how to hack which gets

817
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:27,440
you a slap and dismissal then you get

818
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,020
the respect back and the infirm

819
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,290
you have to learn how to be part of a

820
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:37,930
learning group and that's more important

821
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:39,859
than ever so ethics is always gray

822
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:42,109
there's a difference between what you

823
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:45,049
have a right to do and what it is right

824
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:48,980
to do if it doesn't feel right to you

825
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:51,680
rethink it and get advice and counsel

826
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:53,510
from others but don't just go to others

827
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,970
who you know will approve affirm or

828
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:57,980
agree with you that's like joining a

829
00:35:55,970 --> 00:36:01,250
youth you know you're going the internet

830
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:03,650
I need to find a group that can help me

831
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:06,020
understand the elders the protocol of

832
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:07,640
the Elders of Zion which is a propaganda

833
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:10,310
piece the Soviets used very effectively

834
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:13,430
in the Middle East to convince a whole

835
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:16,069
Arab world that Jews really did all

836
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:18,560
these despicable things said in that

837
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:21,020
false tract called the protocols the

838
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,619
others Zion so if somebody wants to know

839
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:28,849
about it and goes only to a group online

840
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:31,069
that believes the elders the protocol

841
00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:33,020
the elders as I am and then they tell

842
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:36,290
them that and then you join that group

843
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:38,720
and you get wraparound 360-degree mutual

844
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:42,800
reinforcement always from that in-group

845
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:45,109
for it what it wants to believe that's

846
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,560
not what I mean by joining a group or

847
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:51,200
going to others in order to learn you

848
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,390
you want diversity of opinion you want

849
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,029
critical thinking you want to entertain

850
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:57,859
what might even take the buzz off your

851
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:01,819
segments for the moment in order to

852
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:04,490
think it through so you have to become

853
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:07,819
an expert in being ethical and trusting

854
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:11,299
your intuition and what kind of expert

855
00:37:07,819 --> 00:37:13,369
an expert at life you want to become

856
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,060
expert not only in hacking computers not

857
00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:16,460
only in hacker

858
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:19,220
hacking organics you want to become an

859
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:23,089
expert in being an expert in making

860
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:26,089
decisions well how do we do that let's

861
00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:28,759
see if this exists these are the five

862
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:31,130
stages which we move through in any

863
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:34,210
domain of confidence as we become an

864
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:38,599
expert novice advanced beginner

865
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:40,829
competent proficient and expert and they

866
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:43,019
have very identifiable markers with

867
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:45,749
you can use to understand where you are

868
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:49,379
in any particular process in any

869
00:37:45,749 --> 00:37:51,269
particular domain now when we first

870
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,019
developed expert systems you know what

871
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,479
those are

872
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:56,279
we had knowledge engineers we called

873
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:57,930
them there were interviewers trying to

874
00:37:56,279 --> 00:38:00,239
extract the wisdom or knowledge from

875
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:02,368
real experts that they could then codify

876
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,529
in a system of heuristics or if this

877
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:07,140
then that rules which could then be

878
00:38:04,529 --> 00:38:09,209
translated into a computer program so

879
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,609
you could go to the expert system when

880
00:38:09,209 --> 00:38:14,578
there was no expert handy and learn for

881
00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:18,328
example where was it best to drill for

882
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:20,579
oil or as robert buchanan said yesterday

883
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:25,709
brilliant neuroscientist here at the

884
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:27,749
university of texas he he said that when

885
00:38:25,709 --> 00:38:29,308
you're doing diagnostics if you want to

886
00:38:27,749 --> 00:38:31,439
be a doctor please know that a lot of

887
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:33,900
what you do is just following if this

888
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,640
then that rules there are a lot of

889
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,489
things you can diagnose by simply saying

890
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,828
do you have fever do you have spots in

891
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:43,079
your head etc etc and if this then that

892
00:38:40,829 --> 00:38:45,390
and you follow the tree down and you get

893
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:48,599
an answer that's when expert systems

894
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:50,609
were meant to do they took ambiguity

895
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:52,259
into account by weighing conclusions

896
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:55,910
four degrees of probability or

897
00:38:52,259 --> 00:38:59,069
likelihood but those those weights of

898
00:38:55,910 --> 00:39:02,279
probability were also intuitive and not

899
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:04,319
objectively formulated we use fuzzy

900
00:39:02,279 --> 00:39:07,880
logic we use neural nets we do the best

901
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:10,369
we can but on the basis of success in

902
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:13,049
some domains like the ones I mentioned

903
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:15,930
amenable to if-then rules like mineral

904
00:39:13,049 --> 00:39:17,609
exploration or diagnosis they made

905
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:19,649
claims that you could do the same with

906
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:22,199
every domain of knowledge and reduce

907
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:24,599
them to if-then rules and capture the

908
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:27,079
knowledge of an expert in every program

909
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:29,910
in fact they found you couldn't do that

910
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:32,729
some domains of knowledge were resistant

911
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:35,069
to if-then rules either the knowledge

912
00:39:32,729 --> 00:39:37,999
engineers could not clarify a formal

913
00:39:35,069 --> 00:39:39,779
body of heuristics or in their

914
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:41,549
oversimplification they did not do

915
00:39:39,779 --> 00:39:44,459
justice to the complexity and ambiguity

916
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:47,309
of human experience but more than that

917
00:39:44,459 --> 00:39:49,519
they learned real experts do not reach

918
00:39:47,309 --> 00:39:52,839
their conclusions by following rules

919
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:57,008
real experts break the rules

920
00:39:52,839 --> 00:40:01,390
all the time so let's look at how that

921
00:39:57,009 --> 00:40:03,670
works first a novice a novice someone

922
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:06,129
new to the domain is taught rules that

923
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:08,680
are context-free and they're told never

924
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:12,700
to break the rules because they don't

925
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:14,710
know when to break the rules ambiguity

926
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:18,218
and complexity as a result are minimized

927
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:20,650
in the extreme for example a novice

928
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:22,719
nurse to give one example she may be

929
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:24,670
taught or he may be taught how to read

930
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:26,859
blood pressure or measure Li measure

931
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:29,349
bodily outputs or compute word retention

932
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:31,869
and given rules then on what to do when

933
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:33,969
measurements reach certain values you're

934
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:37,569
judged by how well you apply the rules

935
00:40:33,969 --> 00:40:39,789
period but as you accumulate experience

936
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:41,499
you become an advanced beginner you

937
00:40:39,789 --> 00:40:45,519
start to learn something about it

938
00:40:41,499 --> 00:40:47,618
you can even examine some facts free of

939
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:50,439
context or you can use more

940
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:52,180
sophisticated rules but you also begin

941
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,890
to perceive similarities between new

942
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:56,049
situations and things you've encountered

943
00:40:53,890 --> 00:41:00,069
in the past you begin to match patterns

944
00:40:56,049 --> 00:41:01,809
and you begin to think through a nurse

945
00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:03,190
may learn for example from experience

946
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:06,039
how did this thing where sounds that

947
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:08,799
indicate pulmonary edema from those

948
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:11,170
suggesting pneumonia experience is more

949
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:13,420
and more important in other words she

950
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:16,539
will say too or he will say to herself

951
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:19,150
or himself I've heard this before that

952
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:21,969
sounds like and it's on the basis of

953
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:26,829
tacit knowledge or innate knowledge

954
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:29,380
based on personal experience so then you

955
00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:31,269
reach stage 3 you become confident you

956
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,769
become good at what you do you develop a

957
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:35,019
hierarchical procedure for

958
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:36,959
decision-making you understand the

959
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:38,919
situations your counter is sets of facts

960
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,410
interrelated with other sets of facts

961
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,749
the competent nurse to continue that one

962
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:45,399
well no longer automatically go from

963
00:41:43,749 --> 00:41:47,288
patient to patient the prescribed order

964
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,839
but evaluate the urgency of their

965
00:41:47,289 --> 00:41:52,239
various needs and make a plan to recap

966
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,219
react accordingly now this is the

967
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,739
important part expert systems do pretty

968
00:41:54,219 --> 00:42:00,789
well in a lot of domains up to this

969
00:41:56,739 --> 00:42:03,369
level of ability through novice and

970
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:05,920
advanced beginner to competence but

971
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:10,210
stages four and five becoming truly

972
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:12,790
and then truly expert in a domain when

973
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:15,160
we reach those we no longer isolate

974
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:18,040
discrete elements in a situation we

975
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:21,640
respond what we call intuitively to the

976
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:24,370
whole situation we don't apply rules any

977
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,650
longer because we have included them

978
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:30,520
long ago but now we transcend the rules

979
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:33,010
a boxer for example getting ready to

980
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:35,650
decide when to attack does not apply

981
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:38,110
rules about body angle or distance from

982
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:40,960
the jaw and so forth but when he sees

983
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:44,560
the right picture in front of him he

984
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,290
hits he uses the behavior that was

985
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,460
successful in an earlier situation

986
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:50,950
triggered by the similarity of the new

987
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:53,260
situation to the old he responds

988
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:54,879
intuitively to the patterns without

989
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:58,480
breaking them down into their component

990
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,140
features so intuition comes to occur

991
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,900
effortlessly due to discrimination

992
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:07,720
resulting from prior experience a real

993
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:10,720
expert carries this capability in its

994
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:12,459
highest form an expert knows what to do

995
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,950
based on amateur and practice

996
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:17,920
understanding experts are completely

997
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:20,379
engrossed in what they are doing they're

998
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,790
in a condition that the famous writer at

999
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:25,120
the University of Chicago called flow

1000
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:27,160
you lose self-consciousness and are one

1001
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:32,759
with the situation you are in it you are

1002
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:35,920
immersed fully conscious in it so

1003
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,200
experts don't solve problems and do not

1004
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,800
make decisions they do what works and

1005
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:43,660
they know what works experience produces

1006
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:47,320
an ability to discriminate among a huge

1007
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:49,149
number of situations so the experts

1008
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:54,430
response has become unconscious

1009
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:56,140
automatic natural and fluid a nurse may

1010
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:58,240
sometimes sense the patient lies in

1011
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:00,370
imminent danger of relapse and urgent

1012
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:03,549
doctor to act right away they'll pick it

1013
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:05,529
up they'll sense it they say here's a

1014
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:08,170
quote real quote from an expert

1015
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:08,980
psychiatric nurse clinician when I say

1016
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:12,190
to a doctor

1017
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:14,500
this patient is psychotic I don't always

1018
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,820
know how to legitimize the statement but

1019
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:19,210
I am never wrong

1020
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:23,290
because I know psychosis inside and out

1021
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:26,140
feel it I smell it I know it and I trust

1022
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:28,270
it that's the way it comes to work

1023
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:29,890
you're no longer doing check the boxes

1024
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:33,400
and answering questions and following

1025
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:37,779
the rules you just see it and you know

1026
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:41,140
that you're right so if experts access

1027
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:43,450
rules they're meta rules they're the

1028
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:45,670
principles transcend the state of their

1029
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:48,399
known principles and because of that we

1030
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:50,050
may not be able to articulate them just

1031
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,080
like meta rules in privacy

1032
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:55,030
except this abstractions and the

1033
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,819
abstractions don't sound real to people

1034
00:44:55,030 --> 00:45:00,070
who don't function on that level they

1035
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:02,980
think you're making it up they also

1036
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:06,099
think you're acting arbitrarily in

1037
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:07,839
different situations but you're not they

1038
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:10,690
think you're acting arbitrarily because

1039
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:12,509
they can't see the internal basis for

1040
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:14,740
what you have learned and no on the

1041
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:17,410
basis of which you are then making that

1042
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:20,169
decision so it looks arbitrary and

1043
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:21,220
scares them to death and that's why they

1044
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:23,830
respond to what you would call

1045
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:27,000
literalist or fundamentalist sway don't

1046
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:30,250
do that don't do that don't do that

1047
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,650
because that violates the rules at the

1048
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:34,359
level at which they operate the goal of

1049
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:36,790
people in all of this conference

1050
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:39,430
proceedings is to arrive at a level of

1051
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:43,060
expertise in knowing what to do at an

1052
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:45,750
extreme level of self transformation and

1053
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:47,850
know that they know it

1054
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:49,710
but if you don't know it and don't know

1055
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:52,799
that you know it know that you don't

1056
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:55,560
know it in other words here's the second

1057
00:45:52,800 --> 00:46:00,240
wheel if you don't know when to break

1058
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:02,790
the rules don't break through this in

1059
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,069
other words use the rules because you're

1060
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:08,850
novice or advanced beginner or even

1061
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:10,320
confident but if you know why you were

1062
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,970
breaking the rule that that rule no

1063
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,710
longer applies at the level of

1064
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:16,709
abstraction and insight you have now

1065
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:19,620
reached then you break the rule with

1066
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:24,860
confidence clarity and a freedom of

1067
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:27,690
action but if you don't don't do it

1068
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:30,870
there you are this is how you engage

1069
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:33,090
with this like a hacker entering into

1070
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:35,580
engagement or conversation with the

1071
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:38,760
meritocracy that has rules for how you

1072
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:40,500
learn and how you show respect and how

1073
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,050
you do a B sense to those who are

1074
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,330
superior to you you don't walk out of a

1075
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,830
talk and someone's like well I'll use

1076
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:48,779
grabber Buchanan because we talked to

1077
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:50,370
him for an hour afterward and this guy

1078
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,860
really knows what he's talking about you

1079
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:55,109
don't say all used BS he's just an

1080
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:56,850
academic restocked ER or he's part of

1081
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:58,530
the medical establishment if you're

1082
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:01,290
doing that it's just defensive and it's

1083
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:04,950
defensive on behalf of a primitive or

1084
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:08,540
immature ego no you pay attention to

1085
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:10,680
what the best people are saying and then

1086
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:13,259
if you find it wrong

1087
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:16,080
you'd go beyond that you don't just

1088
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:20,190
reject wholesale whole areas of

1089
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:21,930
understanding I think there's someone

1090
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:24,810
who only goes to alternative medicine

1091
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:27,169
and says the medical establishment is

1092
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:29,470
complete scale

1093
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:31,900
refuses treatment for serious diseases

1094
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:34,640
to her detriment

1095
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:37,040
whichever one you make everything it's

1096
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:40,640
never everything some alternative

1097
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:44,029
approaches are good but a lot are snake

1098
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:48,830
oil and some medicine is self interested

1099
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:51,590
in profit driven and Exploited it but a

1100
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:53,420
lot is really pretty selling and it's

1101
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:56,870
not a simplistic thing to simply reject

1102
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:58,940
one of the other so life unfortunately

1103
00:47:56,870 --> 00:48:00,890
or fortunately it's fire dentists

1104
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:03,350
point-blank every morning when we wake

1105
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:05,950
up in the barrel of a gun it confronts

1106
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:08,750
us with its urgency with its immediacy

1107
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:10,580
in real life doesn't lend itself to

1108
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:14,210
simplistic categories of good and evil

1109
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:15,560
it's all gray I don't know if you saw

1110
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:19,190
movie some years ago called the

1111
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:21,110
Unforgiven Clint Eastwood was a Robert

1112
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:24,290
Duvall he got who was playing the bad

1113
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:25,670
guy bad sheriff and after a lot of stuff

1114
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:28,540
where he's clear who's the good guy

1115
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:31,040
Clint Eastwood who's the bad guy sheriff

1116
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,960
Clint Eastwood has the bed guy on his

1117
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,470
back and he's got a rifle in his hand

1118
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,740
and it's pointed at the guy's face

1119
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:41,049
and the sheriff says don't do that don't

1120
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:42,970
it's just I finally got my life together

1121
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:44,650
I got a girl we're living on the ranch

1122
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:47,200
I'm gonna retire from the sheriff I

1123
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:50,740
don't deserve this the Clint Eastwood

1124
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:53,649
said reserves has nothing to do with it

1125
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:58,000
and then he pulled the trigger well

1126
00:48:53,650 --> 00:49:00,280
that's life life tells us a lot deserves

1127
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,640
has nothing to do with it and then it

1128
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:06,490
pulls the trigger knowing that knowing

1129
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,990
what life can do and B means we have an

1130
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:09,520
obligation to respond this is the

1131
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:11,229
ethical part this is the reference part

1132
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,630
this is the hacking part by becoming as

1133
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:16,570
knowledgeable as aware as conscious as

1134
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:18,490
possible with humility and engaging with

1135
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:20,350
it in a way that enables us to take the

1136
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:23,049
reins of our own freedom and power in

1137
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:26,589
our hands and self-transcendence self

1138
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:28,300
transform as we can what does that look

1139
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:33,970
like to be an expert in ethics let me

1140
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:35,850
give you an image oh that's Clint

1141
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:39,850
Eastwood they already did him

1142
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:41,860
that's Huckleberry Finn way back in the

1143
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:43,509
old days when we had what we called a

1144
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:46,840
cannon and literature people read Mark

1145
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:48,550
Twain and my Twain wrote a book called

1146
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:50,800
Huckleberry Finn Huckleberry Finn was

1147
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:52,900
written after Tom Sawyer it was we'd

1148
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,250
call it a sequel today took a spin-off

1149
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:57,250
character and made a whole book about

1150
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:59,350
because he was so popular Huck Finn was

1151
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:01,720
a wild spirit a free spirit and it was

1152
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:05,799
based on Mark Twain's own experiences of

1153
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:08,529
himself as a boy well why is it relevant

1154
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:10,720
because Huck Finn took off down the

1155
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:14,110
Mississippi River on a raft with the

1156
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:17,830
runaway slave named Jim they became

1157
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:20,140
coasts in a way that was proscribed or

1158
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:22,480
forbidden by society in the middle 19th

1159
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:26,319
century in Missouri southern border

1160
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:28,210
state in those times they became close

1161
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,710
and that got to the point where they

1162
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:31,540
knew where Jim was and they knew that

1163
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:34,180
Huck knew where he was and they knew

1164
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:36,310
Huck could turn him in and the these are

1165
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:38,169
the two things that they told Huck about

1166
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:41,750
why he should turn him in

1167
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:42,740
number one it's illegal for you not to

1168
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:46,940
tell us where he is

1169
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:49,370
he's property and he's stolen or stolen

1170
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:51,410
himself and you're harboring stolen

1171
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:54,200
property and you're gonna go to jail if

1172
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:57,140
you don't tell us where he is in

1173
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:59,270
addition this was a fire and a brimstone

1174
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:01,400
kind of Protestant area there was

1175
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:02,840
Hellfire preached from this from the

1176
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,420
pulpit all the time

1177
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:07,250
it's sermons all over Missouri and so

1178
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:09,470
the moral framework of the religious

1179
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:12,320
world in which they all lived without

1180
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:14,629
variation said not only will you go to

1181
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,460
jail but you're gonna go to hell and

1182
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:18,680
that was a hell based on the fire and

1183
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:21,410
damnation and scary stuff for a young

1184
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,910
teen like a Finn you didn't have LSD to

1185
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:25,129
tell him what was real and not really

1186
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:29,690
you couldn't make the distinctions were

1187
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:31,910
gifted with so he was scared so he's got

1188
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:34,580
two threats you're gonna go to jail and

1189
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:36,500
you're gonna be damned eternally and

1190
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:39,040
Huck took that corncob pipe which he's

1191
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:42,620
smoking is sat under a tree all night

1192
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:45,410
cogitating upon those promises and

1193
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:48,350
possibilities and when Dawn came he had

1194
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:51,230
his decision he said well damn it then

1195
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:53,839
I'll go to hell damn it

1196
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:56,930
then I'll go to hell that's what an

1197
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:59,360
expert in ethics looks like all the

1198
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:02,660
rules of the day both legal and moral

1199
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:05,540
and religious told him to do this and he

1200
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:08,240
transcended them in a leap of intuitive

1201
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:10,580
knowledge that the right thing to do was

1202
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:13,399
not turn in what was not property but he

1203
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:15,920
human being and accept the consequences

1204
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,110
as people like Martin Luther King we're

1205
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,600
willing to do when you break law in

1206
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:24,290
order to expose

1207
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:26,450
hello there's a conscience to the

1208
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:31,480
conscience of the neighborhood and the

1209
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:31,480
society and that you live so that's

1210
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:47,330
if you think I'm not tracked okay the

1211
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:49,590
hectare the slides they're just pictures

1212
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:57,029
and I can tell you what they look like

1213
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:58,860
oh it's bad well for the moment it's got

1214
00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:02,070
a tease

1215
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:04,050
okay so society feels legal and

1216
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:07,740
religious truths but they're not always

1217
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:09,300
fused sometimes yes sometimes no if you

1218
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:11,520
follow the rules you've been taught you

1219
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,680
will not necessarily make the decision

1220
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:16,980
Huck did which is I'm not going to turn

1221
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:19,049
him in nor will you mess around with

1222
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:21,900
implants enhancements and alterations at

1223
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:24,030
all you won't touch this stuff because

1224
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,830
the rules say don't touch this stuff go

1225
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:29,370
to Europe oh you need a license to do

1226
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:32,910
biological exploration go to Canada you

1227
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:35,790
can get what is it one two three the

1228
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:38,700
genetic read with suggestions about what

1229
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:40,200
they mean but in the u.s. you can you'll

1230
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,850
get a printout but you can't get

1231
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,160
explanations of what some of them are

1232
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:47,370
likely to point to different cultures

1233
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:50,490
answer these questions politically not

1234
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:53,220
on the basis of science so we're really

1235
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:54,839
talking about situation ethics which is

1236
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:57,359
the recognition that there are times you

1237
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:59,280
have to transcend the rules even the way

1238
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:01,980
they are sanctified by law or

1239
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,960
conventional religion if you know you

1240
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:08,320
are going into a domain of minimal

1241
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:13,510
the ultimate meta rule is very simple do

1242
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:15,040
the right thing do what works that's a

1243
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:17,440
level of abstraction that a lot of

1244
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:21,040
people wear some people can't reach but

1245
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:23,680
every human being can reach it if you so

1246
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:26,200
choose you can reach the level of

1247
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:29,410
expertise in ethics it's called having a

1248
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:31,240
life that works I once went to the Zen

1249
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:34,390
Center in San Francisco and the Zen monk

1250
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:38,649
leading the conversation or lecture came

1251
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:42,040
out and he bowed to the audience as I

1252
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:45,010
believe and then he said do you know why

1253
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:46,810
we bow there's this in center well

1254
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:48,640
everybody in San Francisco's trying to

1255
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:51,070
be more spiritual than that right more

1256
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:53,350
righteous than that so you got religious

1257
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:55,120
answers he bowed because his chose

1258
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:57,850
respect to the Godhead you draw above

1259
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:59,740
all and every answer he got he didn't

1260
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:02,130
reject or put down he just said that's a

1261
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:02,129
good answer

1262
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:08,380
finally no one had the answer he was

1263
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:10,450
looking for he said we bow because

1264
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:14,290
things seem to pretty much work better

1265
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:17,649
when you involve that's been my template

1266
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:20,110
ever since for what is ethical that the

1267
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:22,150
doing of which makes things pretty much

1268
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:25,780
work better not only for you but for

1269
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:27,730
everybody else it's a win-win it's got

1270
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:30,640
to be a win-win I did a talk at Def Con

1271
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:32,500
years ago I said I spoke last summer for

1272
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,089
the 20th straight year at Def Con very

1273
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:36,460
happy and astonished that that had

1274
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:38,530
happened I did a talk second or third

1275
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:41,230
year on social engineering trick was to

1276
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:42,670
elevate your game social engineering is

1277
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:44,440
knowing through empathy and

1278
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:46,720
understanding of a domain how to extract

1279
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,970
knowledge from someone to your advantage

1280
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,980
but the higher level is to extract

1281
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:53,009
knowledge from others in a give and take

1282
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:56,380
so that it becomes a win-win

1283
00:55:53,010 --> 00:56:02,290
that's society functioning at its ideal

1284
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:04,150
level so when we operate in that role in

1285
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:07,990
that domain you may appear to break the

1286
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:09,980
rules but you aren't

1287
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:11,720
if you don't know when to break the

1288
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:15,290
rules as I say don't break the rules so

1289
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:16,009
those are two rows write them down don't

1290
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:17,270
be stupid

1291
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:20,150
if you don't know when to break the

1292
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:21,490
rules don't break the rules that'll get

1293
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:29,030
you through the rest of your life

1294
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:31,759
that'll be $12 each please it's better

1295
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:33,470
than a fortune cookie okay here's

1296
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,240
something else sign I noticed along the

1297
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:36,589
way where are we in time I have no idea

1298
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:40,339
I thought there was a clock on there

1299
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:42,260
oh we're over already Oh Lonnie let me

1300
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:45,580
finish with it let me finish with this

1301
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:48,170
and skip the second half of the talk

1302
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:49,430
which was really the stuff where I tell

1303
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:54,340
you the truth about what I've learned in

1304
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:56,839
the intelligence community but call me

1305
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:58,190
mutuality feedback and accountability I

1306
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,570
learned are the hallmarks of any

1307
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:01,400
organizational structure that works

1308
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:03,560
they're also true for all of us

1309
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:05,360
individually and I'll just say that I've

1310
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:07,430
got things online that explain what I

1311
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:09,140
mean by that but you can take a look at

1312
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:11,240
mutuality means you can't do it alone

1313
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:13,250
feedback means frequent feedback loops

1314
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:15,529
into and out of the systems of which you

1315
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:17,720
are a part at every level of complexity

1316
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:19,640
and accountability means honoring and

1317
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:26,240
acknowledging a higher vision or reality

1318
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:30,020
to which you can continually return in

1319
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:32,750
order to a true yourself up that's a

1320
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:33,860
whole talk and that's about I was I

1321
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,180
really was going to tell you a lot of

1322
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:38,720
things I know that it being developed at

1323
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:40,190
DARPA but that won't happen passing

1324
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,319
through that this is the bottom line

1325
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:45,440
what will you make and what will you

1326
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:47,240
make of yourself and those are things

1327
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,970
you can do education push the envelope

1328
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:53,270
rescale grassroots businesses be mindful

1329
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:55,580
and vigilant and that's me and I'm gonna

1330
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:57,110
say I've got one copy of each book for

1331
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:58,730
those who want to look at the mind games

1332
00:57:57,110 --> 00:58:00,290
was collection of short stories I

1333
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:02,180
returned to writing fiction when a

1334
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:04,100
colleague at the NSA said you can't talk

1335
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:05,060
about this stuff you know unless you

1336
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:07,819
start writing fiction

1337
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:09,650
so I published 35 short stories since

1338
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:12,290
then 19 of which are collected in mind

1339
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:14,690
games last fall I brought out a novel

1340
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:16,930
big novel that's what people used to

1341
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:18,970
read

1342
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:20,500
five hundred nine pages and it's

1343
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:21,819
terrific the best they could do it's

1344
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,920
called phone and it's about the

1345
00:58:21,819 --> 00:58:25,750
conscious and unconscious movement of

1346
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:29,650
information energy between all sorts of

1347
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:31,300
sentient creatures a few years ago as

1348
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:32,740
part of the team that developed that I

1349
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:35,140
do want to show anyone interested in

1350
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:37,089
UFOs in a serious way I will be done in

1351
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:39,400
a second UFOs in government of

1352
00:58:37,089 --> 00:58:42,250
historical inquiry is currently in 65

1353
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:44,140
university libraries it has nearly 1,000

1354
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:46,349
footnotes pointing only to original

1355
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:49,450
documents to government documents and

1356
00:58:46,349 --> 00:58:51,339
primary sources we have set the gold

1357
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:53,169
standard in doing original serious

1358
00:58:51,339 --> 00:58:55,930
historical research into how the

1359
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:59,650
government responded from the 1940s to

1360
00:58:55,930 --> 00:59:01,808
the 1980s to UFO phenomenon and it is

1361
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:03,880
bulletproof because all that data is

1362
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:05,970
grounded in and repeats the words of the

1363
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:10,240
government groups and people themselves

1364
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:12,970
I am so proud of this book either say

1365
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:14,259
I'll show you it's 600 pages long and it

1366
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:17,140
is recognized as the gold standard

1367
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:19,240
that's foam that's the novel that's an

1368
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:21,578
alien who is downsized into an earthly

1369
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:23,919
human body in order to engage in improv

1370
00:59:21,579 --> 00:59:25,630
with human beings and in order to learn

1371
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,480
how humans operate he studies the

1372
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:29,950
internet and cable TV so of course he

1373
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,829
thinks you get in bed with a woman in

1374
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:36,308
ten minutes because he watches things

1375
00:59:32,829 --> 00:59:38,200
like girls and Sex in the City and

1376
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:41,170
Grey's Anatomy and so on so he thinks

1377
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,730
that's the standard of behavior it's a

1378
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:44,890
great book of a lot of narrative threads

1379
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:46,450
inner woven of what she is won and Heidi

1380
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:48,368
the girl he hooks up with at the bus

1381
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:52,149
station who runs fetish sites and also

1382
00:59:48,369 --> 00:59:55,869
as a masseuse is another a lot of great

1383
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:58,680
characters and I loved it I guess I

1384
00:59:55,869 --> 01:00:02,220
guess I'm done I'm out of slides anyway

1385
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,220
thank you very much

1386
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:08,960
I will be available for a little bit

1387
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:10,549
before we have to get our car out of the

1388
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:15,430
Hilton so they don't charge this another

1389
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:15,430
day and thank you very good

1390
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:28,910
so yeah got a first question here let's

1391
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:32,600
do that so I seen a TED talk with a Dan

1392
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:34,970
pilota and he mentioned 40 out of like

1393
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:39,020
40 of seven out of the 40 people who

1394
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:41,029
went up to the Apollo missions only only

1395
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:43,610
stayed married so the other 33 got

1396
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:45,890
divorced and he met he said we can go to

1397
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:47,870
the moon but we can't have it we can

1398
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:50,450
either go to the moon or have a happy

1399
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:53,569
marriage either go to the moon or have a

1400
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:56,060
marriage or have a happy marriage so why

1401
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:57,950
if you say that about a lot of things no

1402
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,670
yeah but at this point you can have

1403
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:01,939
affairs

1404
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:04,280
or you can have a happy marriage you can

1405
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:07,970
polyandrous and have a happy marriage

1406
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:11,420
you can you find in Onaga mich and have

1407
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:14,180
a happy marriage couldn't dan Savage my

1408
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:16,280
question is why is this so easy for

1409
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:19,399
society to want to advancing technology

1410
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:26,000
but it's so hard for us to advance in

1411
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:29,420
our ethics you got another question why

1412
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:32,540
is it so hard yeah it's a great question

1413
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:34,130
part of it is because people know that

1414
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:35,750
knowledge about ethics really is

1415
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:37,340
contextual I had a friend who was on the

1416
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:40,370
ground with special force to say to me

1417
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:41,930
and he sense it with a weight that tells

1418
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:43,819
me that you know when you know someone

1419
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:45,850
knows what they're talking about he says

1420
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:47,960
you know the rules don't apply out there

1421
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:49,910
okay so there are different rules I've

1422
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,590
just given lip service to the different

1423
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:53,720
worlds different cultures and political

1424
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:55,430
systems have but it's the different

1425
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:57,020
rules of for example Obama running for

1426
01:01:55,430 --> 01:02:00,049
office and saying we're gonna come down

1427
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:02,150
hard on intrusion and surveillance and

1428
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,770
getting into office and saying we're

1429
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:05,810
going to be more bush than bush in

1430
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:07,550
implementing intrusion surveillance why

1431
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:09,200
because the first day you're handed the

1432
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:10,880
briefing and you look at the 10 biggest

1433
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,290
threats the United States as the

1434
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,090
intelligence community presents them to

1435
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:15,920
you and you read them and you're now

1436
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:16,490
responsible not for yourself for your

1437
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,820
family but

1438
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:21,709
for the country you say one thing which

1439
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:23,480
is how can we prevent these things from

1440
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:25,310
happening and then when your total

1441
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:27,440
technologies you must use an implement

1442
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:30,049
to do that you will say one thing which

1443
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,100
is do it all of us in that chair at that

1444
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:32,990
time would do that

1445
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:34,610
it's so easy out here to say oh you

1446
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:36,470
shouldn't do that you shouldn't do that

1447
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:38,030
but when you're on the ground in the

1448
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:40,100
contextual situations demands an

1449
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:42,950
immediate response to serious threats

1450
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:45,080
then that's what you'll do so there are

1451
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:47,330
levels of threats to our well-being all

1452
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:49,790
the way up from little things to big

1453
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:52,490
things and how you frame that how you

1454
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:54,560
distort that how you are afraid of the

1455
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:57,439
wrong things all the time how its

1456
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:58,759
exploited by politicians always confuses

1457
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,580
the nature of the threat and what is

1458
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:04,070
ethics eventually it's doing what works

1459
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:05,720
in light of a hostile or threatening

1460
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:08,180
environment which we call our home

1461
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:09,859
planet Earth which hasn't been kind to

1462
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:12,680
most of the species that ever evolved

1463
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:16,310
here so ethics is trying to figure out

1464
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:19,160
in a grey zone in a grey domain which is

1465
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:21,710
always grey what is the best thing to do

1466
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:24,470
now in light of the imperfect knowledge

1467
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:26,180
I have in the presence of what might be

1468
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:30,980
the unintended consequences for the

1469
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:33,319
future so that's not easy and I can tell

1470
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:39,590
you I can do that and have a happy

1471
01:03:33,320 --> 01:04:13,520
marriage it's the second one always you

1472
01:03:39,590 --> 01:04:15,290
practice yes behavior individual good

1473
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,960
question I did have a whole paragraph on

1474
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:19,220
that it was it was what was next

1475
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,500
seriously because when you're talking to

1476
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:22,669
somebody else when they have chosen to

1477
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,770
engage with you as they did in the

1478
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:29,480
ministry and many still do because of

1479
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:30,540
that life and work and my age when you

1480
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:35,160
engage with someone

1481
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:36,630
in that domain you do have a rule the

1482
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,799
rule is you don't give answers to

1483
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:40,500
anybody and you don't tell them what to

1484
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,970
do you try to empower them to have the

1485
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:44,010
ability to make the decision for

1486
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:45,839
themselves which is the right one and

1487
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:48,960
you you may not always know what that is

1488
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:51,360
and and you may also be in a condition

1489
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:54,000
of ambiguity like doctors who willingly

1490
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:55,770
help patients die when they do surveys

1491
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,470
that are anonymous

1492
01:04:55,770 --> 01:05:00,360
many many doctors a huge percentage will

1493
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:02,730
leave a huge bottle of pills with the

1494
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:05,070
patient who wants to die and tell them

1495
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:07,710
don't take all of them you'll die if you

1496
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:09,960
do and then leave the room now that's

1497
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:12,000
not assisted suicide it's warning them

1498
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:13,740
not to do something knowing full well

1499
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,450
that they will do it so there are all

1500
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:17,759
kinds of kludge as we invent to get

1501
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:19,649
around those rules in order to assist a

1502
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,540
person in making the right decision for

1503
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:23,310
themselves but it's contingent on

1504
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:26,190
trusting that they will ultimately make

1505
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:28,950
the right decision and even when I've

1506
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:32,970
had people who are about as aware as a

1507
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:34,950
box of rocks to whom I speak and say

1508
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:36,240
maybe this maybe that and it's clear

1509
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:39,540
they can't make a decision you might

1510
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:41,399
move toward if you do this you know this

1511
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:45,090
is likely to happen don't don't do that

1512
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:47,780
I don't think that's that's wise you

1513
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:50,940
might say that only when you perceive

1514
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:51,960
profound resistance but mostly what

1515
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:54,690
you're trying to do is work with the

1516
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:56,070
person to understand from inside them

1517
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:58,490
because when you listen to somebody's

1518
01:05:56,070 --> 01:06:00,510
story you always wind up with compassion

1519
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:02,520
because you would probably have done a

1520
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:05,100
lot of the same things in their life if

1521
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:07,050
you had been there and so you on the

1522
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:08,430
basis of that empathy and knowing that

1523
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:11,670
you don't know the secret hidden

1524
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:14,399
mysterious core of the being you do not

1525
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:17,880
trust yourself to be God but to be a

1526
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:19,440
helpful companion and that is something

1527
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,760
they never teach you in three years of

1528
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,080
seminary because the only people who

1529
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,180
teach in seminaries your people who

1530
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:25,529
failed in parish ministry and return to

1531
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:28,350
get PhDs and they could teach at

1532
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:30,720
seminary you'll learn that fired to

1533
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:32,790
point-blank range over the first couple

1534
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:37,740
years or you blow out of the water

1535
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:40,830
that's my observation is it was

1536
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:40,830
[Music]

1537
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:48,020
welcome
