1
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,129
so I guess

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:20,510
working with coordinates as I have been
introduced but I'm a malware analyst

3
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:29,930
actually so this is what I'm going to
talk about versus a side note it's for

4
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:34,970
those were working on the warrior game
might be interested in this

5
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,989
don't know if you noticed france for
first that's there was a reference to

6
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:47,629
lunch and some of comic strips biggest
challenge if you did not have a look at

7
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:54,140
them again and then it's just another
hint for the war games well to keep an

8
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:01,160
eye on my slides possibly too and they
will be distributed afterwards of course

9
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:14,048
back to the topic criminal profiling
basically it's plenty of stats Android

10
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:20,100
malware feel free of course to treat
them take pictures or whatever you want

11
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,020
to do about this I would of course
appreciates that you treat them

12
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:30,810
correctly because it's so difficult to
get statistiques correct so as much as

13
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,770
possible

14
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:39,658
well be careful about how it is through
the way the art computer is important

15
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:49,119
because it really matters so actually
how did I compute those statistics some

16
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,459
of them you might have heard about a
project I've been working on it are

17
00:01:53,459 --> 00:02:00,009
presented some other times which is
called she'll outgrow it and what

18
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:06,649
happens is that it's an Android
Marketplace cooler it gets 2800 packages

19
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:13,440
and in there I've got like a big script
that is analyzing and wrapping

20
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,660
properties from the Android packages so
it will get

21
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,609
and information from the Android
packages from the file itself its size

22
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:32,300
they have cash whatever it was from
press it and grab some other properties

23
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:38,370
from the manifest the permissions which
were asked but not only that how many

24
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,200
receivers and was like that the
certificates the Android application is

25
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:51,730
being signed with the resources inside
those looking for armed executables and

26
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:58,929
properties inside those D compiling

27
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:06,920
beautiful and grabbing some properties
or compiled cult that's where we get all

28
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,269
the properties all of this

29
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:15,890
analyzes is static so I have two hundred
and eighty-nine properties which are

30
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:21,910
grab that way and that's how i computed
the steps you want to know more

31
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,650
have to look at those other conferences
where you'll find some were on she'll

32
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,370
avoid the dataset

33
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:40,010
basically we are close to having stats
on one million Android malware those are

34
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,190
taken from Orton its database

35
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:51,390
those are unique sample so fed up with
its removed of course it's not damaged

36
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,040
samples but not always complete samples
sometimes we only have for instance the

37
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:03,280
dogs irritable but not the manifest and
what's very important there is but I

38
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,480
have only very clean

39
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:13,950
applications to compare with as you can
see something like thirteen thousand

40
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:19,940
cleanup occasions compared to one
million of malware that's very low why

41
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:26,500
so few well because it's very difficult
to be sure an application is clean

42
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,889
actually when I get some incoming
samples that I have to analyze I always

43
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:39,250
hate those which were clean because I
have to look for hours in every corner

44
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,479
that I'm not missing something and that
it's not malicious so it's very

45
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:50,440
difficult so we got those leading
applications from some samples that we

46
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:58,750
analyzed well found to be clean some
others we took from some open source

47
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,860
repositories thinking that as the code
but I've been reviewed they were more

48
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,300
likely to be clean but that's not
entirely true so it's an approximation

49
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:19,770
we have done there and as I said well
they're non damage samples but

50
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:25,789
nevertheless I'm not always able to grab
properties on exactly thats million of

51
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:30,440
samples there are some properties which
are only say for instance on

52
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:36,200
certificates of the application and if i
dont have the certificates obviously

53
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,639
cannot compute statistics about that
certificates oK so that's why in some

54
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,529
cases I fall back to like six hundred
thousand

55
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:52,769
samples which have been analyzed instead
of one million still an enormous force

56
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:59,289
oh yeah was going to forget that one
it's also only properties which are

57
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:06,429
taken on the malware well demolished
parts themselves this code and not the

58
00:06:06,429 --> 00:06:14,568
third party kits so if the malware is
shipping with I don't know Google and

59
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:22,999
AdMob for development SDK well we're not
going to grab any properties that hurt

60
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:33,779
the cold that's important so what's
really at a school ranking here so is

61
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:39,759
the number of some Android malware we
have been analyzing 1,000,000 it's

62
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,269
really much more than in several
research papers I have seen sometimes

63
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:51,689
it's only over 100 or 1000 nowadays that
is too huge you be able to do some

64
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:56,470
profiling on the Android malware because
we have over one million

65
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:06,510
malware on Adro it also would pull the
malware up to March 2015 which are

66
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:13,420
included in this study this is because
well they were some other prior research

67
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,220
like the Android malware Janome you
probably heard of but it's like a little

68
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:28,600
bit outdated thats back 2011 that's only
for years but were outdated it's more

69
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:36,180
like some other research has been done
on Andrew its applications such as

70
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:44,360
by-play drone they did a lot of steps
very interesting paper on stats from 400

71
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:52,650
packages but those are were both will
not malware specifically its any Android

72
00:07:52,650 --> 00:08:03,099
application here it's only focusing on
our ok so let's get down to profiling so

73
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:13,260
I've got a very nice and that the green
virus and he says I'm smaller simpler is

74
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:19,340
a true yeah well yeah if we have a look
at the size the first thing that you

75
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:26,849
know jumps into site is that a clean
application is on average like three dot

76
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:33,719
two megabytes of size and malware is
like a lil bit less than the half of

77
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:41,060
that size 15 megabyte in average and if
we have a look at the signs

78
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:49,599
time actually this is increasing
nowadays so like end of 2014

79
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:57,529
well in applications are four times
bigger than this is obviously because

80
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:01,830
well mannered don't need you implement
all features of a clean applications

81
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:08,150
they just need to implement the
Manchester it simple

82
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:14,550
also implemented if you have a look at
Android activities

83
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:23,709
well we have something like only five
activities on average for malware and 11

84
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:28,970
for a clean applications so activities
in Android I don't know P know exactly

85
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:37,020
what that is but basically looks like
every screen or window up the

86
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:43,540
application that you see on the phone
the other 20 services are and receivers

87
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:52,670
are closer to each other some other
things that are nasty virus look loves

88
00:09:52,670 --> 00:10:02,969
to do is read our SMS and send SMS
install applications and shortcuts so

89
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:14,120
what I did is get some recent Andrews of
malware like to do and what clean

90
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:21,760
applications like to do so on the x-axis
there you've got what malware the person

91
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,580
to try of malware that are grabbing

92
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:32,950
during this or that and the vertical
axis what the percentage of clean

93
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:38,350
applications so basically if you cannot
read the figures released precisely on

94
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:44,460
this client at least you can hopefully
see the colors if it read it strongly

95
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:51,130
indicate something that like to do and
if it's green it's something that clean

96
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:57,990
applications like to do so what we see
is for instance that while listening to

97
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:07,460
a national 56% of malware which are
doing that against only 3% of clean

98
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:16,300
application so it's really an enormous
gap they're sending SMS also 43% of

99
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,620
malware dunno yet hiding estimates by
the call of that there's a big girl

100
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:29,540
function abort broadcast above thirty 30
percent in yet on the contrary if we

101
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:39,520
have a look here on HTTP POST so sending
some information via HTTP when we see

102
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:46,340
that both malware and clean are doing
yet so that's why it's not so read but

103
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:56,190
its high up in the diagram something
some other things well it says camera

104
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:01,500
vibrating sending emails but not
interested

105
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:09,480
yeah we'll have a look at what I like to
do some other things besides sending SMS

106
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:16,210
or reading or incoming SMS they like to
install packages to do so they like to

107
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:21,380
have used particularly we've got a
property for that or install packages

108
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,170
permission

109
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:28,750
they like you do do do do that 24% are
doing it against only less than 1% on

110
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:36,310
clean-up occasions this is actually a
bit of the time because using that

111
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:41,079
particular position on a grid will only
work for system applications is not

112
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:45,599
because you're you've got and sell
packages permission under no law

113
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,050
application that you'll be able to
install it in still other ones more

114
00:12:52,050 --> 00:13:00,839
precisely installing shortcuts is also
something they seem to be like to do so

115
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:06,899
over 20% some other surprises though is
things that they don't like to do I

116
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:13,060
thought that perhaps you know sending
emails about 10 expert rating or data

117
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,979
via emails would be something that they
would like to do it turns out that not

118
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:24,720
the are not expel trading most of the
time our data get emails but actually

119
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:34,279
much more frequently yeah HTTP responses
particularly actually they seem to favor

120
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:43,850
JSON objects in the cases we have some
other things that they don't like to do

121
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:50,079
like vibrating vibrating could have
interesting or somewhere for instance

122
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:57,279
your phone keeps vibrating that will for
sure be very annoying you might want to

123
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,079
pay the ransom to start bet we haven't
seen that yet

124
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:11,170
dialing numbers also is something they
do do not do not that much more

125
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:19,410
precisely don't get confused confused
they do send a lot of SMS premium phone

126
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:26,069
numbers but not call them slight
difference using the camera well could

127
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:30,829
have been useful or perhaps first five
where but they're not doing that that

128
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:35,560
much I guess would be only interesting
if we are a very important person which

129
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,010
where you are

130
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:43,860
not and disabled leave the keyguard well
they have no interest in that because

131
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:51,970
that's just unlocked the screen you have
something run and malware can just run

132
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:57,800
services in background and it will do
just the same thing so no no use for

133
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:07,849
their commissions give give me all your
permissions that says we are well we've

134
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:13,930
got a clear difference again between the
number of commissions which are asked by

135
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:22,620
the malware malware are requesting over
seventeen permissions on average average

136
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:29,350
some of them much more some of those
were of course and spleen applications

137
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:35,950
on average it's only 60 there's really a
big difference there

138
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,090
oh those are the top you

139
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,830
permissions that

140
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:45,520
where are requesting there is no
surprise

141
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:53,000
probably young on this internet is of
course one of those they like you to ask

142
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,050
for very often but clean applications
also like to to get the internet

143
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:03,339
promotion

144
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:11,230
lines here you've got the percentage for
malware and Red Rock clean and green and

145
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,970
the difference is in yellow so what
we're really interested in the instance

146
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:22,120
those permissions with a high level of
yellow which we can see for instance for

147
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:34,840
again those send SMS permissions or read
SMS permissions research works like

148
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:42,600
actually do you focus on very much and
analyzes have permissions but to be

149
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,270
honest I'm not sure that's a good idea
because permissions are not that's

150
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:55,329
reliable Navigon approved here why on
those graphics you've got the first few

151
00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:00,790
the first two bars which are the
percentages applications are requesting

152
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:07,310
a given permission and then the next two
bars is how much they are actually using

153
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:13,810
that permission and as you can see for
instance for the coal formation where's

154
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:19,159
there's a huge difference between how
many miles we're actually requesting the

155
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:26,040
permission and those who are really
using it so you can request permissions

156
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,639
if you're not using it well it's just
that you don't know how to implement bad

157
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:40,340
bed coater but it's not really a
malicious issue and you'll probably

158
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:46,020
notice I have the other pointer here
around there we've got the device

159
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:52,990
administrator permissions and a bit
strange fuels and tell me because in

160
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:58,430
that case we have more applications
which are actually using device

161
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:07,360
administrator functionalities than those
which are requesting it so the answer is

162
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:17,310
that our dataset your we have quite a
few malware for which we do not have the

163
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:23,610
manifest we only have the beautiful so
in that case if we don't have to

164
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:30,060
manifest we have no way to know if the
application was actually asking for the

165
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:35,429
permission or not so we didn't count it
so that's why stats looks a bit strange

166
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:46,330
in that case as I said permissions not
reliable first because while you can

167
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:50,179
requested permission and not actually
use it

168
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:56,740
seconds it's because of the way I have
computed the status and the way I have

169
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:04,500
built the dataset I don't have manifests
in all cases and then of course for

170
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:12,180
hackers we can bypass permissions sure
you know that right we can use if we

171
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:17,570
want to access internet for instance
well we can invoke the browser or some

172
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,350
other

173
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:24,689
application that has the right to access
internet we can escalate privileges

174
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:31,020
while we are abating an application
there were some issues on that at some

175
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:36,879
time there was also a member of it was
beginning of this year and not another

176
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,330
issue 1 hijacking of the year and read
and $2 so you thought you were

177
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:48,189
installing this application but just
actually different gods installed it was

178
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,929
another one and of course you can use of
exploits

179
00:19:53,929 --> 00:20:07,990
permissions now as for malware authors
so who do they want to target well

180
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:17,390
almost as many people as possible as was
so we have another property that is

181
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:26,210
called the target SDK so it will say
which kind of Android application is

182
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:31,740
poor and we have if we have a look at
that we see that on average malware will

183
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:37,490
be targeting Gingerbread which is
something like Android three something

184
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:42,730
whereas clean applications were rather
target on average jelly bean which is

185
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:49,480
above like were not remember if its bird
0 overshadowed for something like that

186
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,970
ok so it makes sense

187
00:20:53,970 --> 00:21:02,500
authors want to target us much people as
possible the stones dads are it's the

188
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:09,140
best I could come up with perhaps
they're not that reliable again because

189
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:17,390
only actually very few applications
provide thats target SDK million Android

190
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,580
malware that I

191
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:25,059
had only seven thousand actually
provided the Android SDK so it's a bit

192
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:35,549
difficult to me as real reliable stats
over there then for the others who were

193
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:42,940
the target them well it looks like they
are treating china russia things but

194
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:53,000
graphic attribution $400 and for an
email where it's always difficult so how

195
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,769
did I do that well in the Android
applications we've got a certificate and

196
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:05,919
that certificate whereas you got the
identity of the issuer of the subject

197
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:13,960
and we I can count the country out of
that and say probably edit targeting

198
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:20,029
this country or it is coming from this
country are built up a script there to

199
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:23,879
grab all the certificates and

200
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:30,998
find out which are the countries which
were concerned by the the certificate

201
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:37,419
but it's quite difficult because you got
to rule out plenty of cases like I found

202
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:46,269
so many dummy entries people putting I
dunno gif or re K or argue was a country

203
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:55,179
code there's no country for those I also
found at some point that in your bag ban

204
00:22:55,179 --> 00:23:00,329
want to and I thought all that it
strange that I have so many hits for

205
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:04,859
that country had a look at it and no
there was you win all entries so it will

206
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:11,989
probably fake so I had to rule that out
so in the end I actually ruled out like

207
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:20,489
63 percent of all the certificates I had
I also ruled out all development or

208
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:25,249
deberg certificates for Android so all
the ones which are your Google best of

209
00:23:25,249 --> 00:23:30,899
the time but you see you need team each
case when you're starting to build your

210
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:39,478
application and the end so out of
600,000 certificates I start to drip at

211
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:44,899
the beginning I and i ended up with only
one hundred and fifty thousand

212
00:23:44,899 --> 00:23:48,870
certificates which had a country that
loose

213
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:59,790
was no meaningful not sure crap and
again it's really pretty too tricky

214
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:04,899
afterwards do you attribute it to the
right country there were so many cases I

215
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:12,080
had to handle have a look at the result
to make sure that would be okay it seems

216
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:18,639
that no so many developers are entering
that country Ron get annoyed me very

217
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,230
much because they had people are putting
the country to order code they're

218
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:31,290
putting the code so 86 for china for
instance I had to put that back you put

219
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:39,639
that in the scripts special rule there
are people who are putting names of

220
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:45,030
towns were states are things like that
in the country so that helped me very

221
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:49,980
much improved my geography skills that's
how I we learned that room for instances

222
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:59,110
in Zimbabwe didn't know that before
there are also some like it some time I

223
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:05,000
came up you know for the time countries
which are targeted and there was like

224
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,910
maybe third country or something like
that

225
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:12,620
Switzerland I thought gosh why
switzerland I mean it's not enormous

226
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:18,030
country they're not renowned for know
either spreading orbiting that targeted

227
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:23,990
by malware so I found it strange how
they look at my script and then I so all

228
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:29,760
the entries actually that the country
code was see age but obviously it was

229
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:37,360
understood as an abbreviation for China
again had to modify my script at that

230
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:45,620
one at some other time I had burns also
popping up in the tub country's currency

231
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,770
again that's really strange I didn't
know there was a hacker community so

232
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:54,620
strong there and it was just because I
had a bad regular expression in my

233
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,179
script

234
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:03,270
and I was picking up picking it up jeje
minus two hours like that I try not to

235
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:12,550
do you have to script so then the others
have to discuss their is well is that

236
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:21,010
country which certificate is it reliable
and is it the country of which is

237
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,840
targeted for the country of origin

238
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:29,970
the best bet is that it's the country
which is targeted because there's some

239
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:34,500
used to put the real country they're so
too fast to make sure that Android

240
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,900
application will actually be able to run
in that country but it really seems that

241
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:46,120
in some cases the matter author did put
some reliable information about himself

242
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:51,379
or herself so we have for instance
students in Mumbai where we have no

243
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:56,300
other details they seem to be right
there zip code is correct code instead

244
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:04,550
of the country but it's correct why
would they be doing that for fame

245
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:10,870
possibly because they don't believe that
their application is malicious Perhaps

246
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:17,659
it depends on you know lures or points
of view to make it more difficult for us

247
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:23,900
to do some correct attribution possible
as well or maybe because there are

248
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:29,480
regional application was Trojans and in
that case world the person who Trojan

249
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,210
that would retain the same certificate
and just inject some malicious code

250
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:42,810
inside as possible so I can't say if
it's really countries where our region

251
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:48,100
from came home from work or if they're
targeting it's a mixture of both as

252
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,750
you'll see so

253
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:57,220
resume targets of all those Miller I
could gather the country from while the

254
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:08,100
first country to you with that comes for
us as Russia with 65,000 from there

255
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:16,740
USA 40,000 China 30 thousands and then
quite low behind some other countries

256
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:27,950
such as a bit surprising perhaps United
Kingdom and Australia this is for all

257
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:33,930
members since Android malware exist so
like starting 2009 or something like

258
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:41,950
that if we have a look at some mothers
and only take for particular years

259
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:47,880
well it's a bit different we see some
evolution in 2014 the first country to

260
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:59,010
come up to pop up first is China and its
UK and Russia and then and very very low

261
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:05,490
behind some other countries which are
Australia Switzerland Italy and Spain

262
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:11,830
Singapore and then loads of other
countries france actually eat in that

263
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:19,710
list came like 20 seconds so it's not
that high what's not in the release of

264
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:28,380
lower ones either and reduce our than 50
well I only have the stats were the

265
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:35,310
first quarter of 2015 for those it seems
as if it will be confirmed or not that

266
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:42,520
the first one china and then very far
behind and the rest of some other

267
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,020
countries popped up as ukraine Japan

268
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:59,310
harass those are some other countries
which we hadn't seen that much before oK

269
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:05,260
so that's where they come from so now
authors with Arthi looking for our

270
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:12,640
secrets of course so it seemed kind of
figure as the other one when you see

271
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:19,860
flashes red it means that malware are
really interested by that and when it's

272
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,850
green it's more cleanup operations which
are interested by that and what we see

273
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:31,560
there is for instance the are very much
interested in IMEI IMSI the sim operator

274
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:39,540
code they are also interested by the
model of your phone but actually

275
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,350
everybody is seen as well

276
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:50,800
interesting information like that I'd
say that the IMEI the IMSI the phone

277
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,399
number

278
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,960
everybody had expected that a treadmill
room would be would like to get those

279
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:04,300
it's like captain obvious what perhaps
is not that obvious is again

280
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:10,760
difference between malware and cleanup
occasions I mean I had expected number

281
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:16,890
to be interested in my phone number but
I had expected them to be six times more

282
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:22,600
interested in my boner than cleaning
applications that came as a surprise

283
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,010
MAC address

284
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:30,890
ways listing other applications on the
phone for times more interested in that

285
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:40,030
I mean that's really significant their
mother surprises I thought you would be

286
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:47,550
interested in my GPS coordinates the R
twenty-two percent or interest in this

287
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:52,950
but clean applications as well so
there's no difference here between clean

288
00:31:52,950 --> 00:32:03,120
and now we're getting my gmail address
nine percent of malware compared to 13%

289
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:09,330
of cleanup vacation so that confirms
what I said earlier that were not that

290
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:14,470
interested in emails that's maybe a
little surprised because females can be

291
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:25,050
valuable for spam or whatever you need
all that information that they are

292
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:31,360
grabbing and we piled up while we see
obviously that number are trying to get

293
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:40,620
far more information than three
applications we can also compare it with

294
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:47,870
F droid repository that proposal for
years but particularly because it only

295
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:54,659
heart free and open source Android
applications and just out of curiosity

296
00:32:54,660 --> 00:33:00,910
are ran the status on that particular
market place and it seems that those are

297
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:08,430
cleaner in a way that's the are gravely
less information than even the clean

298
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:15,030
ones the clean data set that I have

299
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:25,030
looks like

300
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:36,540
high-level development but were not so
keen on low-level ones I gathered

301
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:41,690
saddest 6 about plenty of properties
about various techniques they would be

302
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:48,030
using so that's like panel of those
properties you we have for instance

303
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:54,950
reflection encryption using special
class in Android which is called X class

304
00:33:54,950 --> 00:34:01,650
loader which will help you load some
other topic executables lighting

305
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,160
applications

306
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:11,230
issuing some commands with no super user
to fix this before trying to install

307
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:19,270
another app using the command-line lying
p.m. and sell and then apk detecting

308
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:25,219
they are running on Android emulator or
not all that kind of stuff and I got the

309
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:32,489
person had roots of Android package use
Android malware which are using that and

310
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:37,520
those that clean applications are using
them out so that's the spider web but it

311
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:49,800
gets so for instance using this command
for instance well its 10% of malware

312
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,440
compared to read something like eighty
percent of clean up the kitchen which

313
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,420
are using that so what we make out of it

314
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,710
well the thing that

315
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:08,070
I make out of that is that they do not
seem to be eunuchs geeks the they're not

316
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:16,750
using that much compared to applications
those Unix commands such as mound or

317
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:24,730
even you know packages busybox like that
it's less than two percent of cases most

318
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:30,580
of the time they are not detecting that
they are running on the emulator

319
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:36,980
can be done easily by finding some
properties on the emulator looking for

320
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:44,960
special to QMI you a strange things like
that they are not using command-line to

321
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,300
install implications well some of them
are but it's not in general what they

322
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:59,720
are doing or not either and that's very
good for rest as an analyst has me

323
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:06,529
they're not using that most native
development so we don't see a lot of use

324
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,990
of GNI

325
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:17,959
23% is pretty much but cleanup occasions
as well so not particularly more formal

326
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:24,980
wear for clean it's like basically the
same when the they're not that much

327
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:31,300
either trying to run because he grew
executables by bad special called

328
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,049
runtime

329
00:36:32,049 --> 00:36:37,949
I'm exactly like that there's no
significant significant difference there

330
00:36:37,949 --> 00:36:51,759
but what the really interesting is well
on the way to use the Android SDK they

331
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:56,609
will be using the board to broadcast in
a way probably it hadn't been

332
00:36:56,609 --> 00:37:02,910
anticipated before you can see all for
instance SMS messages they will be using

333
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:08,949
classes which are less known like next
class loader they will be hiding icons

334
00:37:08,949 --> 00:37:15,779
of the applications also surprising
perhaps they're they're coming from the

335
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:19,699
web world and they'd like web
development because we see quite a few

336
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:28,119
of them trying to use JavaScript 23
percent of our are trying to enable or

337
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:36,199
embedding pages with JavaScript where no
one percent clean I mean ok those are

338
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:43,759
only stance but like that without some
significance behind it it has to be

339
00:37:43,759 --> 00:37:51,099
saying something about the the people
which are coding it surprises again

340
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:55,929
because what I don't have an answer for
all the numbers and all the figures I

341
00:37:55,929 --> 00:38:01,249
present I was surprised to see your
reflection and encryption with such a

342
00:38:01,249 --> 00:38:07,899
high level of percentage seventy percent
of power are using reflection and

343
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:15,499
cleaners diluting it pretty much maybe
because it's not all Java developers

344
00:38:15,499 --> 00:38:22,140
know about reflection I don't know I
don't have the answer for that one is

345
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:28,029
really very strange is also to see that
there are some clean applications which

346
00:38:28,029 --> 00:38:30,000
are using

347
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,250
KPIs editors opened X files were low
text file opened X-files private it's

348
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:43,960
it's your security issue 11 wayward can
be at least because you can load another

349
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,710
dog executable without warning the the
end user and clean applications are

350
00:38:49,710 --> 00:39:02,780
using that Asian nation of course we
expect similar to using up vacation so I

351
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:08,120
measured how much they were using
various obfuscation techniques one of

352
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:17,980
the most trivial technique is inserted
some no not play operation and third

353
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:23,130
I'll be quiet code so as to make it's
probably a little bit more difficult to

354
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:29,990
disassemble well that technique is used
by let's say everybody's words not

355
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:38,870
really meaning for the basic application
which is used by which is proposed by

356
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:47,279
ProGuard and which renamed all the
classes into a CD those as well as used

357
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:54,580
in many cases above well twenty twenty
percent of applications which are using

358
00:39:54,580 --> 00:40:03,210
that then I also had a property which is
which is triggered on particular

359
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,890
obfuscation techniques which was
demonstrated in

360
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:16,049
2012 by faxer that his Twitter handle
Peter shields i think is his name and

361
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:24,990
well it's very interesting technique
there but it only happens in 20 25

362
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:31,979
percent of malware so very few I so
would it still because it's still in

363
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:39,069
five thousand cases in 2013 so it's
pretty much 5,000 malware using that

364
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:46,819
particular technique but then it stopped
I haven't seen it in 2014 and not in

365
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:56,140
2015 of course we've got to be cautious
because you're attribution is always

366
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:02,660
difficult it's not because the
certificate says it's in 2014 orders as

367
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:12,710
it was created in 2014 but it was and
idk protect is another major why did

368
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:17,630
launched when there's a matter of fact
well it's used in less than one percent

369
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:22,650
of Andrew mower that we have in 2014

370
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:30,099
I would have expected it to be about you
know higher than that as I would have

371
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:33,220
expected it to be more will hire

372
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:38,689
I thought well okay so are you right
where are your property's really right

373
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:43,509
or are you doing something wrong I
checked it I have some properties which

374
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:50,569
are reliable for instance detecting for
not detecting apk protect or detecting

375
00:41:50,569 --> 00:41:59,079
that particular liners we've abused
doctor it's the detector is working and

376
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:05,799
it's accurate I don't think I have any
errors on that the way I detect basic

377
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:11,440
application using ProGuard though it's
not as good I'm probably missing some

378
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,500
cases so I said it was like 25%

379
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:21,220
want maybe it's thirty mania 235 I would
have to work on this to have a better

380
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:29,580
property detector and the other thing
which also kind of bothers me is that I

381
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:35,529
discussed with another matter analysts
robert pitofsky you a year ago and he

382
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:36,390
told me well

383
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:42,740
abusing liners sweep we have we have
something like thirty percent of men

384
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:50,100
were doing it and I have less than 2% of
Maori doing it so I mean two percent

385
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:57,680
thirty was right there and I know that
Robertas reliable so something is

386
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:04,850
probably either there there's an issue
there I can always be missing a few

387
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:13,410
cases but it seems to me that has 30% is
about to hire as we are also exchanging

388
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:20,960
samples so there's something wrong about
that some other techniques well it looks

389
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:27,090
like you know malware authors are
perhaps a little more technology save it

390
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:32,000
then the others I had a look at these
certain hashing out grants which word

391
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,390
used in the certificates and it's well
it's really kind of a side note but it's

392
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:43,770
interesting to see that none no
percentage of a clean applications are

393
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:50,740
still using every five I hate him if
it's it's crap but it's still there and

394
00:43:50,740 --> 00:44:00,729
luckily or not likely are using every
five or less and if we compared with

395
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:07,390
droid well even better I have no actions
with the Droid I'm not actually aided

396
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:11,210
but still very using the latest

397
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:19,800
two hundred and fifty 556 a grid which
is not that much used by the other

398
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:31,109
malware cleanup occasions exploits of
course I had to build some properties

399
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:38,029
and detectors for exploits to see how
much that would be used in malware I did

400
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:44,250
that I did I did build some detectors
for a specific explodes rage in the cage

401
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:52,869
levitate ur membered right well mine
detectors are crap so I'm not going to

402
00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:57,480
present this data it's about that I
obviously have to record them

403
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:05,990
fortunately my my detector my generic
detector is working well I check that

404
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:13,720
one and it looks like exploits from a
general point of view are used in less

405
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:21,790
than two percent of malware ok so that
interesting I hope for you guys because

406
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:28,000
insecurity communities Ayala and have
people telling me all exploits are no

407
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,250
people like things malware authors are
using the things which I believe is

408
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:34,500
killed every year

409
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,520
technology cool things like that

410
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:44,080
well it's not true I promised a dust
explosion of you it is not true

411
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:48,640
less than 2% of applications are doing
things which are you know a little more

412
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,960
advanced than than we think

413
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:59,400
same thing I had I have some other
properties for better detecting the use

414
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,170
or the thing that malware are searching
for some specific applications which are

415
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:12,020
use for when you've got an answer a
rooted so we have properties for

416
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,300
detecting

417
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:21,270
trying to do something if you have an
agenda for him which is like no and

418
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:27,400
nurture negative or some other
applications which are used to france

419
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:32,290
permissions do this for that application
which are only used on route to

420
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:41,240
platforms and again it's only less than
2% of applications malware which are

421
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:46,439
using this which perhaps comes a little
bit of a surprise though really means

422
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:53,100
somewhere that actually malware authors
using so difficult tricks in their

423
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:59,380
applications in der in what they're
spreading they are not because he says

424
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:09,860
things were also pretty well yeah keep
you too much for meeting its no I don't

425
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:17,540
think so just as a recap well those are
still had a million of malware however

426
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:24,529
some regular stats I have as I have
highlighted are more difficult to spot

427
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:31,750
where to get actually so there are on
samples in this still at least you know

428
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:39,770
there are hundreds of thousands of of
malware which is pretty much also

429
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:43,850
another thing we can now keep in mind

430
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:52,020
dad are not as complicated as we think
they are from his dad has exploded view

431
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:59,690
they're they're usually rather simple
there you are not using that much

432
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:05,829
a phone would be rooted or not they are
not using UNIX commands that much

433
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:15,050
written it is true by guilt Android
developers but not really low level down

434
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:18,390
no not so much

435
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:30,460
native developments that's why they're
interested in money and if you get money

436
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:37,279
with simple scheme is you don't need to
build up complicated ones right so

437
00:48:37,279 --> 00:48:42,279
that's why I as well we see in the
beginning that there are smaller than

438
00:48:42,279 --> 00:48:49,990
cleanup occasions where they like to do
well like very much to read or send an

439
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:58,029
SMS to like to grab IMEI or phone number
and there's a significant difference to

440
00:48:58,029 --> 00:49:05,400
were compared to those cleanup occasions
for that they really like to spread more

441
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:11,240
and to do to extradite more sensitive
data than those cleanup vacations that's

442
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:19,848
really something that will identify
malware as word geographic attribution

443
00:49:19,849 --> 00:49:26,099
well it looks like countries like China
Russia USA and others are top targets

444
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:35,089
but it's difficult to attribute nowhere
to some countries or not and that's all

445
00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:43,960
you've got my contact information
actually my husband we've worked on

446
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:49,849
with me and helped to achieve those
statistics and you've got plenty of

447
00:49:49,849 --> 00:49:56,109
other links they're down there if you
want you to look more into how those

448
00:49:56,109 --> 00:50:02,730
properties were computers more details
anyway I'm available and if you've got

449
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:02,960
questions
