1
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:16,009
now okay well we'll have to live without
the bottom 10% of the slide

2
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:23,520
thank you for the warm welcome and hello
Paris honor to be here I'm carson then

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:30,920
often talking about picking up and at
the risk of sounding like a broken

4
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:39,590
record I wanna once again come back to
the topic was what I think is the most

5
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:46,610
effective way of breaking phones because
unlike our previous results we had to be

6
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:52,150
somewhat close to the phone this time
you can do it remotely it's not an

7
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,790
attack against Android or iPhone or any
of those it's an attack against a mobile

8
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:10,280
networks and one works worldwide it
launches overdue as a worldwide

9
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,310
interconnect technology that ties all
the different networks to Gaza and that

10
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:24,530
it has relevance for 3G and in some
cases even LTE so I think just as two on

11
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:32,510
the message that breaks 3G I do
wonderful time today also on

12
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:40,100
self-defense not just telling you how we
break into networks but how you can do

13
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,669
your bad in detecting and perhaps
preventing disease attacks because so

14
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,960
far most hiking talks that i've seen

15
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,630
given myself have not focused on that
enough so let's start with seven and

16
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:03,520
find out what that is the global network
that connects companies like t-mobile

17
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:10,310
and Vodafone and SFR so that they can
exchange information will try for

18
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:16,090
instance if you send an SMS from one end
to another network that's delivered over

19
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,720
S 07 also if my phone

20
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,829
German phone once to do anything and
France French network needs to

21
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,210
communicate with the German

22
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:34,180
network agree on building agree on
encryption key is that all happens of

23
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:43,330
SSS SSS evan is also used internally
don't buy a network for scenarios in

24
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,180
which different parts of the networks
have to exchange information and that

25
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,530
work is broken up into different
locations and each of the locations is

26
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:58,840
governed by its called of yellow or
refer to it as an MSc so in a country

27
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,310
like France Dolby maybe forty embassies
each of whom are responsible for the big

28
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:12,480
city or some other part of the country
now imagine you are in a phone call on

29
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,530
the highway and you leaving a city going
into another MSC Aurea those two

30
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,760
embassies have to communicate so that
your phone call doesn't get disrupted

31
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:31,269
and again S 07 is it's almost like going
to another country and so indocin are

32
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:37,210
you doing New MSC to wonder if you're
driving to watch as the old MSC for the

33
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:45,510
encryption key of your phone call so
this is a network over which encrypts UT

34
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:51,040
shouts change and encryption keys of
phone calls that happening right now and

35
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:59,600
you can already see what abuse scenario
maybe not going door to door has seven

36
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,850
has been known to be insecure for a long
time if you google SSL security it has a

37
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,329
disastrous track record however nobody
can really explain

38
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,330
good up until last year what was so
broken about it you find lots of

39
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:24,680
references to people trekking over seven
that is finding a phone's location and

40
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,100
in fact of washing clothes publicized
last year they have two companies are

41
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:36,500
bold enough to put out advertisement
material even patterns on how to use as

42
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,889
a 74 tracking and

43
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:44,590
behind all the material that they found
there was one nasa seven requests called

44
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:51,438
anytime interrogation extremely creepy
name and its official name

45
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:56,039
anytime interpretation you can
interrogate the location of any phone in

46
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:01,770
the world using this request and it has
no purpose whatsoever as I don't spying

47
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:10,430
on people s 07 standards forever perhaps
noting two states and state agencies

48
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,150
contributing to the standards when they
were first created for the washington

49
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,429
post last year

50
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:22,180
find all these shoes all these services
are offered online for tricking people

51
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:28,479
and if you treat somebody using any time
gatien you get their seller IDs so you

52
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,199
know which building somebody has pretty
accurate now anytime interrogation it is

53
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:43,039
just one out of many as 27 clothes and
somehow the whole sense of SSF be

54
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,699
insecure was tied to any time

55
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:51,969
2002 after the washington post story a
lot of networks stopped accepting any

56
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:55,949
time there was no reason to have
accepted in the first place so there's

57
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:01,969
founded looking at and they're saw it as
a seventy cutie was soft however it's

58
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:07,919
just one of hundreds of queries you
consent of assists seven and will now go

59
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,799
down the rabbit role of these other
queries saying on the topic of trekking

60
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,949
from moment so anytime intervention
doesn't work anymore but many other

61
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:24,029
message do other commands that are
absolutely Cleveland to any time to

62
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:26,979
ration resolving a phone number

63
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:36,479
into somebody's sell their current
location not blocked yet because nobody

64
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,688
has been talking about him in the
washington post but there's also other

65
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:45,139
messages that don't necessarily result
of phone number into a location but into

66
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:46,110
something else

67
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,569
MCS embassies in and those other
identifiers

68
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:56,189
can be used with yet other queries
assists seven to get the location so

69
00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:02,169
it's kind of like Rob programming in the
early days where if one gadget didn't

70
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:06,998
get you to call you strength together to
and of course you could have a long

71
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:10,439
chain of different requests resolving
numbers in different numbers in

72
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:17,330
different numbers until eventually have
to location and talked about this for

73
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,729
the first time last year was different
networks and some of them of Sadr

74
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:22,938
responding to them

75
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:31,339
others didn't and eventually the press
picked up on it including the more and I

76
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:35,219
don't know if he's here today but he
definitely has the best french language

77
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:42,919
reporting under topic and he's he's
following up on it too so thank you for

78
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:50,318
bringing just 22 at least some people's
attention as a servant is not limited to

79
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,300
tracking dog I always considered the
worst attack since when private

80
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:04,189
communication is acceptable that is as
emails or phone calls and at least four

81
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:11,919
phone calls as a seven UT risk and
that's what we want to go into next so

82
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:18,909
how can somebody intercepted phone call
isn't even in your country somehow

83
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:23,459
connected to Tessa seven network
anywhere in the world right I won't get

84
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,759
into all this as a few scenarios

85
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,639
has been covered sufficiently and all
the other stuff denial of service fraud

86
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,579
and spam

87
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:36,789
I feel like that's your problem of two
operators should solve it in our own

88
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:42,620
interest just intercept they need to
solve for others it's not really known

89
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:51,740
interest to keep us private coming back
to when I explained how I S S seven

90
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,630
works different a massage can talk to
each other and requested key of A

91
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:01,569
currently happening phone call this
request is supposed to be used only was

92
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:02,520
in one now

93
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:09,090
obviously in fact handing over of an
ongoing phone calls from one country to

94
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:14,230
another country's operator wouldn't work
that's just not technically possible it

95
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:21,160
will disrupt and you'll have to call
again the area however supporting

96
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:27,520
handing over the keys from one embassy
to another does work perfectly well even

97
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,240
between different countries even between
countries that don't share order on the

98
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,350
opposite end of the world they can say
the person who's currently having a

99
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:45,890
phone conversation enjoy networks are in
let's say is now in Australia while the

100
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,850
phone call is happening please give us
the decryption keys so we can continue

101
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,190
the phone call

102
00:09:51,190 --> 00:10:01,120
makes no logical sense but works so
that's the first way in which you could

103
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,140
intercept somebody's phone calls asking
for decryption key locally caring for

104
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:13,160
the locate the radio waves according to
radio waves and then decrypting the

105
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,670
phone call

106
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,699
demonstrators at the end of this chapter
to live it involved so let me first

107
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:25,430
enumerate two more methods in which a
phone call can be intercepted the second

108
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:29,510
one is still a local attack somebody
will have to be close to you let's say

109
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:42,330
an American Embassy and it works off MZ
catch us and just seeing but also did I

110
00:10:42,330 --> 00:11:00,560
think what I should do so maybe

111
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:15,099
users were generally known as an emcee
catcher a device that pretends to be a

112
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,710
base station longing to a network but
it's not actually part of the network it

113
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:28,940
could spoof to the again orange SFR any
of the other ones if it does so the

114
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:35,240
phone on GSM the oldest technology has
no way to distinguishing the real cell

115
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:43,600
tower from the fake cell tower this was
solved by 3G UMTS UMTS introduces what's

116
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,440
called mutual authentication in which
the network to cell tower has to

117
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:58,910
identify itself authenticate itself to
different however these of indications

118
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,959
request again

119
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:10,320
possible s7 and most networks do not
distinguish request a legitimate as a

120
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,100
new phone is currently in trials and a
French cell tower asked for an

121
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,270
authentication to people versus request
not possible

122
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:26,350
a phone that was just observed in trials
and now request funds from Australia

123
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,140
again Desa Seven Network's don't
distinguish and you can carry

124
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:37,920
identification to calls during phones on
TMZ catchers and going through the full

125
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:45,800
cycle of mutual authentication this is
still locals some will have to be close

126
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,420
to your phone and we'll talk a little
bit about ma of atoms catches in the

127
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,790
third chapter on self-defense let me
first complete enumeration of the three

128
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:03,130
message in which he intercepted the
third one being essa seven carries that

129
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:10,410
I mention completely different purposes
that is called redirection

130
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:16,889
so the idea is that instead of being
whether phone calls happens make the

131
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:19,389
phone call go somewhere else entirely

132
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:25,860
be men in the middle and then redirected
to wear was originally supposed to go to

133
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:32,839
this works in 2007 actions the first
erection that is incoming calls

134
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,550
works with standard call forwarding you
may use voice mail on your phone right

135
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:45,599
which if you have your phone switched
off it goes to a different location has

136
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,360
recorded as a voicemail and then you can
treat later you can set those voicemail

137
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,100
numbers on your phone and you can even
set it so that every call you have

138
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,069
received always goes to voicemail
directly I know when you don't want to

139
00:13:58,069 --> 00:14:09,969
be disturbed for instance and dad is
entirely possible offices seven so one

140
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:28,430
second

141
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:33,430
alright

142
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:40,229
so once my part of the demolition work
and that is actually being able to call

143
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:51,070
the real number because apparently if
you activate as many as as we do they

144
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,490
get blocked for two months and are not
allowed to roam so I tried it this

145
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:59,200
morning this number is not allowed to
roam in France adept at the demos

146
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:11,560
physically the same anyway so if I call
this number so disconnects me to a

147
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,069
German voicemail system is again the
phone is CEO of it can't connect so

148
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:26,850
that's how it should happen but if if I
send a supplementary service request of

149
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:37,410
ASO 7 I can make this is number 42
anywhere else instead of going to

150
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:46,839
voicemail and how it goes to dis from
different phone and this of course could

151
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:53,720
be detected now being smart enough to
call the original number after after

152
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,890
deactivating

153
00:15:54,890 --> 00:16:01,600
supplementary service which again is
just 107 message and then you are men

154
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,810
and the middle on every incoming phone
call and it doesn't have to be in your

155
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:12,250
country could be any number in the world
so that's how how scary this as a seven

156
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:22,579
things can become this works in the
other direction also using someone

157
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:27,810
offered quirky message so of course
there's no standard redirection for all

158
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:31,959
outgoing calls right every time you dial
a different number but there is a

159
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:36,768
service that you can register as a seven
that helps you

160
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:43,480
avoid wrongly type numbers so let's say
Vodafone Germany my provider they're

161
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:49,459
registering such as service and if i
dial a German number from this phone was

162
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:54,849
our dear country prefix butterfly nets
in the country prefix

163
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,739
so I don't have to change the numbers in
my address book I can go to another

164
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:03,379
country and is still reached a German
numbers even though the network CNN

165
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:08,919
embalming on SFR wouldn't understand a
German makes sense

166
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:14,789
anybody can register do services versus
seven so you say if this person dials

167
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:20,480
any number forwarded to the service I
will correct it and sent it a real

168
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:27,360
number and this of course allows you the
same type of attack you redirect all

169
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,158
phone calls to one location and then
forwarded them to where they were

170
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,899
originally supposed to and again

171
00:17:34,899 --> 00:17:40,809
worldwide intercept from any place as
long as these messages are not being

172
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:46,789
block of S 07 and those two sets of
messages we have not seen in many

173
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:51,408
networks who can block them the problem
here is that people wonder used those

174
00:17:51,409 --> 00:18:00,620
messages and that brings us to the next
question how easy is it to do to prevent

175
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,570
assessor seven attacks from happening so
the first of the three attacks very

176
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:09,668
simple it's a message that's only
supposed to happen was in your own

177
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:15,080
network if it comes from another country
or another operate in your country just

178
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,649
acknowledge drop it no need to answer
the other two though not so simple

179
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:30,559
beauty security from russia they used to
describe it and that fits pretty well so

180
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,460
so far nobody really knows how to do
this plausibility checks how do you

181
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,200
actually have a computer that says this
person was in France you can't be in

182
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,610
Australia five minutes later so nobody
does she shakes

183
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:51,110
but that would actually be required if
every state full intelligent firewall

184
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:58,330
and looking at the security level that
that operators I heard the call up until

185
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:02,939
a few years ago was GSM it didn't even
have mutual authentication they used to

186
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,480
shitty so far from the eighties stateful
intelligent firewall in his house too

187
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:15,520
little too much noise will promise he
showed that the first type of a tech and

188
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,929
preparedness little video there's a lot
happening to individual so let me let me

189
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:26,880
walk you through step-by-step all we
have is somebody's phone number that's

190
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:33,640
what we start with we put this phone as
a parameter into a psoriasis and message

191
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,020
which is the first message required when
you want to send an SMS and as a

192
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:45,910
response we get to MSC that someone is
currently connected to any to emcee ok

193
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:50,000
we need to use two parameters for
another request

194
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,260
psi request and distant gives us a
location so dis is already enough

195
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:03,270
futures wanna know where somebody race
intercepted communication so we go to

196
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:09,820
that sell location and start recording
was jurors small radio here we start

197
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:18,909
recording to La Paz 3G and his case and
decoded with you radio and as always on

198
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:24,220
every freakin see different cells
communicating 3G scan of amazing in that

199
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:31,650
everybody used to same frequencies not
interfering anyway so we have to under

200
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:39,410
scrutiny radio to fight which cells are
using to spend trying to sell CEO and

201
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,290
one is exactly the one that came back in

202
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:51,750
yes I request so we know this is the
right cell the next scene we did a

203
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,920
sentence psi request again

204
00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:01,270
and observe has been booked up by the
network when we send us a request and

205
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:04,470
that's how we find two teams that's

206
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:10,170
identity under which phone is currently
no one in that network and two teams he

207
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:14,830
is super I'm it into yet another request
that gives us the Keydets currently

208
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:19,360
being use so you see how you string them
together as gadgets to go from a phone

209
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:27,449
number 22 currently used the phone but
there's no one step message to do so now

210
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:34,530
again we sound recording and it just so
happens for demo purposes of that

211
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:43,830
destroyed received an sms sms should be
part of the recording that we have so

212
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:52,179
again running a lot of new radio stuff
we can we can find a whole bunch of

213
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:58,160
transactions again in 3G a lots of lots
of things are happening in parallel and

214
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:04,700
wire sagas is your bestfriend show can
decode all that good stuff right away so

215
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,650
we let Wireshark tell us which
transactions are currently happening in

216
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:21,880
those thirty seconds haven't recorded
something like five transactions that

217
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:29,150
are happening so we wanted to find any
of those five transactions the first one

218
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:34,460
is actually was attempted we need so why
is hotel service which channel was used

219
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:40,450
so all these frequencies divided into
channels and now we have all the

220
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,950
information we need we have a radio
capture we know which cell was used this

221
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:54,250
one we know which channel undersell and
we have to decrypt Ricky I know that

222
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,080
it's only 64 bits decryption key we'll
come back to that later and then again

223
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,199
friend and was all this information it
can decode in Assam

224
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:12,139
so this is almost life intercept of 3G
communication by abusing as a

225
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:18,699
seven-point abilities and so far this is
the only way that I know to break 3G it

226
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:24,820
seems very involved but if you're a
member of GSM research that was even

227
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,418
more complicated when we started and now
it's a single best script at your run

228
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:33,730
and Racine kind of magically happens so
I'm sure somebody will build this

229
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:38,720
eventually into a commercial product and
I would hope that at least is serious

230
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,970
networks will at that point

231
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:51,010
have found a way to to to enable Asus
even message filtering alright

232
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:57,230
3G can if that's a strong message to
take home

233
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:03,769
3G is not not a technology that solves
all the security issue of course even if

234
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:10,149
necessary even is not at fault 3G has
health problems on its own and i wanna

235
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:13,479
dive into to such problems

236
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:19,440
ultimately what we will be showed up
until now is that the capability that we

237
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:26,269
have was GSM that is used to live
recording Airways that's possible

238
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:32,720
was a software-defined radio and the
capability to crack that's possible it

239
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:40,370
was SSSs so we're kind of the same if
SSL furnace week but some 3G networks

240
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:46,330
are even worse than that found in a
small sample said front from my own

241
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:52,629
traveling five networks that didn't
react at all so your 3G but no

242
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:59,559
encryption whatsoever I think nobody's
surprise in cambodia that's the case and

243
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:06,260
two out of something like ten networks
in india don't have encryption but I was

244
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,600
very surprised to find a hundred percent
of the South Korean now

245
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:17,149
highly developed country right
definitely is spying enemy neighbor in

246
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,929
the North that hundred percent of the
South Korean networks do not use any

247
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:26,580
interruption talked with them they
didn't really remember ever hearing

248
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,110
about encryption the promised to look
into it that's a year ago I don't think

249
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:37,939
anything has changed so 3G by itself is
is not a holy grail you will have to

250
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:44,980
switch on its encryption to even if you
do that there has been claiming for a

251
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:53,620
couple of years to be able to jump over
this quickly to be able to break 64 bit

252
00:25:53,620 --> 00:26:01,280
key and the key that's used to encrypt
GSM 3G of course comes from the SIM card

253
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:09,820
and some seem able to produce a long
okie hundred twenty eight bit some SIM

254
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:15,990
cards are limited to 64 bit and from
this northern publications we learn that

255
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:25,110
the NRC abuses exactly does that day or
the GCHQ depart now in England have been

256
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:34,939
developing a computer for me to say four
million pounds some four years ago so as

257
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:41,270
long as it has 1 million pounds now they
can break 64 bit key we had been

258
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:47,780
proposing such a computer to last year
at had to take two years ago we said

259
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:53,320
we'd need a million euros just
theoretically so every organization was

260
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:59,899
even modest spine budgets can break
those keys so you aren't es is not

261
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:07,830
secure if all the sim cutter use every
network used to have only all SIM cards

262
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:14,280
at some point introduce yourself on not
again in India almost all SIM cards or

263
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:21,260
64 bit so even those networks that did
switch on 3G security they're not secure

264
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:28,570
against an adversary was a million euros
appropriates a PlayStation six in a few

265
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:36,510
years right design sketch has done
faster we are tracking this information

266
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:45,158
as it comes in a website called GSM apt
to do that and on GSM different pieces

267
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:51,799
of information including and I should
have checked us including the number of

268
00:27:51,799 --> 00:28:04,179
SIM cards received a 3G vs editor 64 64
bit 428 and you see in france there are

269
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:12,380
four main networks for which he saw SIM
cards and three of them every leader of

270
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,580
the better SIM cards and one of them

271
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:21,830
France Telecom is at about half the
population on the cut so easily and

272
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:28,439
acceptable even on 3G LTE should say if
that's even supported for those SIM

273
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:37,690
cards by GCHQ NNSA this website takes a
whole bunch more including 3G security

274
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:45,919
and you see that into G everybody's to
catch up after years of doing nothing or

275
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,990
even getting worse but in 3G that's
Alliance

276
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:56,740
the networks are not doing much and our
metric is pretty simple

277
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,830
the first ninety percent you get rought
switching on encryption the remaining

278
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:07,720
10% you get short-changing to Tim sees
you remember how individual used to

279
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,510
stimpson number over and over again and
it never changed

280
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:17,110
well it should change this and suggested
you should change it was important

281
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:24,580
action in France all need has so far
seems to do that the other ones don't so

282
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:28,840
there's still a little bit of catching
up to do to class

283
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:34,320
but of course much more catching up to
do for let's say two South Koreans so

284
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:44,760
this was my personal summary of how
things are with 3G definitely a well

285
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:50,240
encrypting technology but at least three
things can go wrong you can forget to

286
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,750
switch on the interaction you can use
all the SIM cards that can create long

287
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:04,510
enough keys or you can expose yourself
over SSH seven now there's so many

288
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:10,029
things that can go wrong in the network
that we as consumers have hardly an

289
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:14,529
overview of where we can go and which
network is secure under which

290
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:22,270
circumstances which attacks to have to
be afraid of and over the years we found

291
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:26,370
a bunch of attacks as as found a bunch
of attention is just so many attacks

292
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:30,469
autorité that are delivered over SMS

293
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:36,390
our sim cut research will be in fact SIM
cards over by Maria so they could be

294
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:41,460
disastrous 11 attacks so we discussed
today that could be kinsey catchers

295
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:47,630
base stations that s 07 makes possible
for 3G but of course there's also

296
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:52,149
although in two catches for two to excel
work and that is general network

297
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:57,189
problems where they forget to switch on
encryption or whether you citizen cuts

298
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:02,799
and it's quite frustrating to look at
this long this in or how much you could

299
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:10,559
be spied on a good news story is every
single one of those wastes to know that

300
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:18,928
tax happen or could have been from the
phone to phone knows when you're sending

301
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:24,740
stuff to the sim cut the phone is being
pinked every time you can vary

302
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:31,600
information about it over set as a
certain coaches send out obviously

303
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,129
different signals from normal catchers
and on certain network security can be

304
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,380
measured from the phone for Norris vs
connected to

305
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:46,250
shitty well protected network and that
information hasn't so far been available

306
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:53,990
on any phone what we spend almost the
entire last year on was to kill out us

307
00:31:53,990 --> 00:32:03,960
information on Android we found Qualcomm
chipset it's very much like phone chips

308
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:10,970
to be very open it has debug interfaces
with inquiry for radio information

309
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:15,930
pretty much all the information that
Android tries to keep away from Qualcomm

310
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:21,250
will give you and you can carry to
Qualcomm chips from Android so we found

311
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:29,470
ways of extracting to G 3G LTE data and
we created a library so that somebody

312
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:36,190
can build an Android program to warn
about distribution areas and we spend

313
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:46,990
end of last year building up very
program called snoops which considers an

314
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:53,540
IDS intrusion detection system it
doesn't necessarily prevent very much it

315
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:58,610
just looks at information and says
somebody's messing with system are you

316
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:04,969
one now connected to an EMSA catch maybe
I don't send an important SMS don't make

317
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:09,940
an important decision out what that
you're currently connected to has no

318
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:17,230
interruption but I filter matters in
India let's say that do have so does

319
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:24,530
this application has been out since
December and on on Google Play we have

320
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:29,050
some 200,000 down votes and then it's of
course also an F Troy it and all this as

321
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:34,450
a platform to a couple hundred thousand
people have have you set at some point

322
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:41,650
including insurance funny anecdote you
guys know better than me that is too

323
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:46,570
slow being discussed of what's being
discussed back in march on more massive

324
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:49,679
valence possibilities for the police and

325
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:57,640
one important aspect of his law would
have been to make it captures illegal so

326
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:03,290
that the police can you simply catcher
ok there was this big protest against

327
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:10,420
the law that would have made into
catchers illegal and people as part of

328
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:15,870
their protest a used to stool to find
that there were right there right and

329
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:27,319
being spied on by coaches get the irony
I think we're going too fast to follow

330
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:36,170
up on that and to try to fight back
under currently illegal use of MZ

331
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:41,450
catchers and after police is using them
to spy on protesters that's not fighting

332
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:57,180
terrorism that is fighting liberty and
I'm I'm very glad thank you

333
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:04,250
I hope there is no backdoor attempt
occasion

334
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:09,309
well it's it's hard to prove that we
have some time we have like eight

335
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:14,050
minutes to to make some questions I'm
sure people here will have a lot to ask

336
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:21,670
for you have some you have to finish the
essay people upload before you finish

337
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:33,050
but these do absolutely so how did how
it looked search find it seemed to

338
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:39,349
capture an image he catches single that
would be a hundred percent proof that

339
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:45,690
there is an easy capture but in terms of
culture has to be a different from the

340
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:50,670
normal network for instance to get UMC
it's in the name at once to catch him

341
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:57,839
see but most phones in most transactions
do not send out an emcee and setting

342
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:06,759
used to steam she has to be -have
differently and it has to make you

343
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:13,049
disclose more information go through
more unnecessary transaction tensile

344
00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:19,180
force and soups such picks up on that
sucks compared to current behavior of

345
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:23,279
every cell to the database is stored on
your phone

346
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,790
of how this network behavior previously
for instance if you're in France every

347
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:34,119
network uses encryption in implicit or
may not so that's a very strong

348
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:41,010
indication if all the sudden the network
says no encryption today it's not so

349
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:45,609
easy in South Korea obviously we're even
to default is no encryption but that's a

350
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:50,598
different story so it it piles up all
this evidence in it gives you warnings

351
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:57,619
and it isn't your story so I warning of
let's say a squat n it's definitely

352
00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:02,930
catch it triggers all these different
values of two schools let's say three it

353
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,460
may be false positive

354
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:10,290
can you help us and ultimately yourself
using hers if you upload these events

355
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:15,910
all weekend and license that's
completely voluntarily you can upload

356
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:22,819
measurements about the network orders
him to catch SMS event and aggregator

357
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:28,700
and then for instance give a heads up to
a newspaper that we say around this

358
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:33,589
political process in their country we
see more abuse you want to look into

359
00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:39,279
that and that has been working out
fantastic so far we still don't have

360
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,330
enough information to make a truly
public continuously a lot of work

361
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:47,869
children through the false positives but
the long-term goal is to have a map of

362
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:52,070
where mobile abuse is currently
happening so people can start five bag

363
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:59,780
and people in this room I hope will be
part of that so to to quickly wrap up if

364
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:07,760
you want to do something against mobile
abused to finally stop asking to mobile

365
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,960
networks to become bad and to finally
start do something about it ourselves

366
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:19,450
will go on GSM ever make sure you pick a
network that that gives you two

367
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:23,419
protection you need in france does not
too much of a difference the next time

368
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,940
you're traveling make sure you Romana
now blocked at least as encryption

369
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:32,109
enabled to get soup search it's not
supported on all phones obviously

370
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:38,940
iPhones and Android phones goal you need
to root your phone I know not everybody

371
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:44,310
likes to do but she did anyway or you're
running on synergen martyr any of those

372
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:51,349
then upload attack activity if you can

373
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:58,220
around justice French protest weather
saw being spied on by Hamza catchers we

374
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:03,990
only got one or two uploads that day but
we saw several people twittering about

375
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:09,240
these warnings of soups it just didn't
share the information was anybody do

376
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,758
that in the future it helps everybody

377
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:17,859
D and then finally if you really want to
change something take to open source

378
00:39:17,859 --> 00:39:23,709
application and make something awesome
was it look into the LTE traces tried to

379
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:29,339
build your own insecurities and
contribute it spearheaded a database do

380
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:34,109
something completely different and we
never saw you have access to all to

381
00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:40,929
Jesus 3G LTE data on your phone now go
do something I'm looking forward to

382
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:44,509
hearing your results and thank you very
much for being so patient
