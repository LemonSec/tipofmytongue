1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:17,759
thank you very very much I got the name
Captain Crunch

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:28,040
in a cereal box this particular whistle
sent out a 2600 hurts tone which took

3
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:35,730
control over the AT&T long lines of the
United States telephone system

4
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:44,559
affectionately known as ma bell then a
monopoly and calls during that time are

5
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,559
very expensive and it just so happened
that I ran into some blind kids who

6
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:57,120
found out that the Captain Crunch
whistle could make this pitch that could

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,150
control the telephone lines I just
happen to have fun with me right here so

8
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:10,539
here's how it would work if you blew the
whistle like this you hear two tones

9
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:18,900
however you had to hold the whole like
this and it goes like this that's 2600

10
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,890
hearthstone when you made a long
distance call and blue this missile into

11
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:29,380
the phone you would go and then all of a
sudden you get a little bit of white

12
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,470
noise and you are now having total
control over the trunk line between two

13
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:44,610
cities to dial in number two I go 13 and
continually like that I could make a

14
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,670
long distance call for free by calling

15
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:56,770
information number like 60 for 555 1212
and I would blow the whistle into the

16
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:04,289
phone and then connect to make the car
go through later on the telephone

17
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:10,239
company change their system to multi
frequencies for the frequencies used two

18
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,940
tones out of a possible six tons each
tonne

19
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:21,859
had a different way of telling you the
first tone 700 hearthstone at a

20
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:30,270
frequency rate of zero nine hundred
hearthstone had a weight of 1 1130 don't

21
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:40,860
have a rate of 2 1500 hearthstone have a
weight of four and 1700 stone but have a

22
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:47,150
weight of seven so by combining the two
towns you can make a binder a tonne

23
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:55,770
princely 700 which is way 20 and 900
which is a way to 12 digit 12 dial it

24
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:05,450
did you really you would have 900 stone
and 1100 stone which is two and one at

25
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,690
them together and makes three and so
these are how the tone for combined

26
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,900
together to make the call but before
that you also have to do one more thing

27
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,959
you've ever said the special keep all
stone and that where the 1700 stone

28
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:27,280
comes in when you send it to 1700 stone
that particular tone along with 1,100

29
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,050
yards tone with me to call to keep old
stone and that is the beginning of a of

30
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:38,480
a call so if you dial in number you have
to keep the area code and the number and

31
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,230
then a start tone which is another 1,700
+ 1500 third stone and that would cause

32
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:50,060
it opening and the number and clothes
and the reason why you had to sandwich

33
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,970
the number between the keep posting star
is because of the mechanical switching

34
00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:00,410
system used by the phone company back in
the day as they had three digit numbers

35
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:05,519
they had four digit numbers they had
five digit numbers at six digit number

36
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,840
seven digit numbers and ten digit
numbers and you had to have a way of

37
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,830
doing

38
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,660
the beginning and ending of the number
whether that number would be a

39
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,649
three-digit number or 62 number and
that's how the blue box became sort of

40
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:30,890
like my my ability to take total control
over the phone system early on of course

41
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:37,520
I got in trouble for doing it because I
got basically what happened was Steve

42
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,349
Wozniak co-founder of apple computer so
I a magazine article it's called the

43
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,390
secrets of the little blue box

44
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:51,900
Esquire magazine article it was sitting
on Steve Jobs desk in his living room

45
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,159
and watched that magazine article and
you couldn't believe it he thought it

46
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:04,050
was just until he went to the Stanford
library and he found out that oh my god

47
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:10,360
for real and so he got the technical
journal and built a blue box but the

48
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:17,330
problem with steve was he as a digital
person and I am an analog person but

49
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,159
when you send a digital tone down the
phone line you can cause all kinds of

50
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:29,530
problems and if you use his blue box his
blue box what caused the phone company

51
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,020
to catch on to the trick pretty quickly

52
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,599
one of my acquaintances but Steve
Wozniak's blue box and got busted for

53
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,950
using it and my phone number was in his
address book

54
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:48,360
against my advice he did not memorize my
phone number and against my advice but

55
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,000
Steve Wozniak spots and it was that box
that got Richard in trouble and what

56
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,290
which eventually led to the FBI catching
me going on right now I'd say about me

57
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:07,360
before five years later I was very
interested in wanting to know all the

58
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,600
800 numbers in washingtonDC so I scan
and I found out there at 10800 numbers

59
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,410
in washingtonDC I called every single
one of them and in my attempts to call

60
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,700
this number as I found all kinds of very
interesting things

61
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,060
I found computer access numbers I got
the number to the congress the

62
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:34,470
congressional watch line number so
Congress can make calls using their

63
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:40,630
their system and I also got this very
rude person that answered the phone and

64
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:47,800
this person was extremely very hostile
towards me I said what number did i dial

65
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,810
and he says get off this line ok so kind
of recent few red flags with me so

66
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,580
couple hours later I call them back and
I said this is white plains or a tool

67
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,700
switching center we have a translation
problem when you're on your number what

68
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,219
number have we reached and the person
said you've reached the white house by a

69
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:15,690
crisis hotline number this was in 1974
President Nixon was present at the time

70
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:23,080
and so I went ahead and I used the blue
box to attack the line and waiting for a

71
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,010
call to come in and a call came in
saying Olympus please and sure enough

72
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:34,870
nixon's voice came on the line and so
and Olympus list is naming it is

73
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:42,080
Kootenai so couple weeks later I go to a
party one of my friends got that number

74
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,140
I gave it to him I didn't care about it
and she decided to call that number I

75
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,740
said before you do it better loop
through a number of switching centers

76
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:58,380
before you actually make that call he
did he got president on the line and he

77
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,700
said Olympus please and the person said
one moment sir nixon came on the line

78
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:10,630
and said my friend said serb we have a
problem we have a shortage of toilet

79
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:16,840
paper in Los Angeles and this was the
first quarter instance of being able to

80
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:23,060
plant the president so this is kinda
like the story and i published it on my

81
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,860
web site for the very first time in 1997

82
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,000
and that's when I put my website online

83
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,769
time hours on a system called the well
as a whole earth electronically so I was

84
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:46,190
well dot com slash brunch and that was
my first website and in my first website

85
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:51,200
I talked about the story and since that
time our website has been extending and

86
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,250
expanding well that's sort of like my
old stories about what I'm about and now

87
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,709
let's talk a little bit about the
present and the future and then I like

88
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:02,819
to open it up for questions

89
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,870
let's talk a little bit about security
and privacy we all know what happened

90
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,980
two years ago

91
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:18,570
Edwards study went to Hong Kong to meet
with the reporter and talked about

92
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:24,860
releasing all those in a state documents
one of the documents of course was that

93
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:31,750
prison project where the NSA was tapping
and getting direct feeds from Facebook

94
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:40,870
Twitter Apple Microsoft and all the
other companies that were in bed with

95
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:46,500
the NSA and they had a hotline the NSA
could actually access to those servers

96
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:57,970
totally unfettered and granite wall
along with Porteous was at the Hong Kong

97
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,779
where they release that information

98
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:07,570
this was depicted in a movie called The
Citizen or you haven't seen the movie go

99
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:19,010
watch it it's so the NSA goes if they
want you they've got you on your

100
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:24,350
computer data on your iPhone they can
they can activate your camera or

101
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:30,269
microphone and they can activate your
microphone also on your laptop or

102
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:36,010
desktop they own it and they have ways
of getting into your system and there is

103
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,449
just no way you can keep them out of
your system so the best and the most

104
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:48,839
secure way you communicate is getting a
little thumb drive with tails thi s this

105
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,310
is a small little compact the Linux
operating system on a thumbdrive you

106
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,399
boot from the thumb drive and you
totally removed from all of the other

107
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,529
aspects of the computer that you're
actually posting your keyboard is not

108
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:08,890
your keyboard monitors don't work
anymore and so that's the most secure

109
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:14,730
way and on tales is where you would keep
your PGP keys pgp stands for pretty good

110
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:22,220
privacy PGP has been around since the
mid nineties and wanna go into some of

111
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:30,209
the more up-to-date programs the problem
with PGP is very hard to use ok you got

112
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:35,739
key management you got she brings you
got to create a generate a key pair

113
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,300
secret key keep on you and your public
key you give out your friends so your

114
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,630
friends can use a public key to send
encrypted message to you and all in all

115
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:50,720
it's very difficult to use even know
most browsers today will have pgp

116
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,480
plugins so you could actually use pgp
with your Gmail and all of the other

117
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,459
types of the email messages on their ass
talk a little bit about smartphones ok

118
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:08,279
we've got the entryway and we got the
icing on the Android you've got to

119
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:13,319
important programs actually three which
are really good possibly even for the

120
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:18,110
first program is called red phone that
that program is recommended by Edward

121
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:25,779
snowden as the most secure communication
voice system you can get today along

122
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:31,439
with that is that is a text application
called text secure or secure text I

123
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,910
don't recall what it is

124
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,469
on the ice

125
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:40,920
you've got a program called signal
signal combines both the red phone and

126
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:48,099
the text secure all in one package
called signal other application programs

127
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:56,110
are quicker as felt without the its WIC
case are not Wyck ter it was written by

128
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,790
Niko cell

129
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:03,480
she's a woman and she is a person who
has no love for the Annecy she is a

130
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,990
DEFCON attendee since day one and she
wrote this program and she's got it on

131
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:18,430
the end Roy on the Apple Macintosh and
Windows Linux and course iPhone other

132
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:26,000
programs you have our this was written
by russians it's called telegram very

133
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,990
good secure program of course whatsapp
allegedly whatsapp supposed to be secure

134
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:40,760
ID anymore not since Facebook got a hold
of it there goes the neighborhood and of

135
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,800
course you wouldn't trust it certainly
wouldn't trust Facebook messaged her or

136
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,969
anything other than programs anymore but
that's kind of a rundown on the programs

137
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:56,130
you can have available for your item
today I highly recommend you get into

138
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:00,240
the habit of using these programs just
as easy to use as you're just using a

139
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,160
phone call it works great I use it all
the time anybody wants to get ahold of

140
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,990
me on wicker my twitter name is shady
frenchman and so you can anonymously

141
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:19,180
contact me that way anybody who contacts

142
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:25,030
anybody is concerned about me and you
know you gotta remember that the

143
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,880
authorities are watching me big time

144
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,200
and so if you want to be remain
anonymous

145
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,570
still contact me on Twitter you can know
you can give me a wicker name that's

146
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:40,500
totally not related to you and you can
communicate with me and so it's pretty

147
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,240
much a rundown of all the applications
that are on the smartphone now what I'd

148
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:59,150
like to do is open it up for questions
does anybody have any questions anyway

149
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:09,060
you are free to talk with Captain Crunch
later on is nothing yet so just and it's

150
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:14,219
the same for any of the speakers you saw
today some had to leave and four others

151
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:22,380
you can meet them just right outside so
I think this concludes our session of

152
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,800
talks thank you very much

153
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,959
