1
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:12,420
Sao Paulo Melinda

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,350
I

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:29,660
122 percent you submit sightseers along
and install trust robotic Google+ for

4
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:44,530
why wait for that because you do have to
reduce everything you see around you so

5
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:54,640
my philosophy is not know recycle not
throw away I am against recycling

6
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:41,050
recycling is to reduce Israeli filmmaker
cuter

7
00:01:41,050 --> 00:02:04,120
so began to to make this someday I take
especially for you know well I

8
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:21,860
questioned me and what can I do with
days there so I found the drawing

9
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:40,460
drawings were popular in five yes I hope
so I want to make my own draw I was not

10
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:46,310
no idea how to make a draw so I have to
learn everything from scratch

11
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:59,260
yeah

12
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:27,290
so before this I make another 122
practice so 22 of the stuff works so

13
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,879
that's cool

14
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,290
surrender and he was making my Linksys

15
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:56,739
so it was cool but there's no fly so I
decided to make a drawing so lonely self

16
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:13,060
is kinda weird stuff because you have to
to design a system to sense all the

17
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,930
emotion of of the shower

18
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:29,370
wrong place that we need much motion
sensor so I decided to use Wii motion

19
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:41,150
sensor motion promotes 22 this is tough
because we like to remind philosophy dun

20
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,080
dun

21
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:50,750
the recycle symbol essential

22
00:04:50,750 --> 00:05:07,220
whether I decide to reuse them so how
can I can accomplish that what the

23
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,190
sensors tell me in a different way

24
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:33,170
always drawn moving so we need your
school is the Wii motion by the company

25
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:48,090
the angular rate the motion is is mister
by the lower rate if you tell me who I

26
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,270
am

27
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:56,390
moving in its access to see

28
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:07,099
to show win this game but some technical
problems I have Nexus tablet at that

29
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:34,110
time I am i doing so if I but no sensor
for itself is able to do tell me that

30
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:45,390
the absolute angle of the of the motion
respect around I need to know how we

31
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:55,060
smoked respect the company profiles

32
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:06,850
I'm moving in its actually this is a
bitch roll calls so I need to integrate

33
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:18,260
these things I need to multiply these
moving along the time so I have to do to

34
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:25,070
calculate the absolute anger respect the

35
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:40,670
emotion anger so what happens is I i do
this again if I mention that I'm 00

36
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:49,760
degrees I mean there anything but when I
come back to share the grease

37
00:07:49,760 --> 00:08:05,740
miscalculation hospital after an hour or
so I need to to cancel that day's why

38
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:16,410
companies that well they will lose is
their companies and other essential to

39
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:28,330
to complement that really I need to I
need accelerometer accelerated counsel's

40
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:41,620
brief of the general scope so I need to
to calculate and I need a fielder

41
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:52,960
calculate the dream and I struck the
grief from the absolute anger so that's

42
00:08:52,960 --> 00:09:02,140
a dramatic return me when I'm not moving
when I know moving it cancels the grief

43
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:19,189
of the jewish hope so

44
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:46,230
you can see the attached to what to make
of controllers in that time there was

45
00:09:46,230 --> 00:10:06,160
not a really know something so we was
difficult so when I say basic basic

46
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,459
working of the drone

47
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:18,340
the drama has no moving parts it's their
propellers so we have to move them in

48
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:26,649
different ways at different speeds to to
reach an effect over or stay stay

49
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:44,079
stabilize so scared so this is before
the start of the week after I have

50
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:56,138
explained there were in the green box so
we have a web browser has no application

51
00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:26,450
uses Firefox running of the web page of
the the reuter so

52
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:30,430
so

53
00:11:30,430 --> 00:12:13,750
so

54
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:22,970
I can't control through the web browser
but it's not quite

55
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:33,000
properly so we need some kind of control
and I chose remote control and joyously

56
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,290
this is not a fancy remote control these
ideas he attached to our reuter another

57
00:12:40,290 --> 00:13:07,310
route that this here is they made so I
can start their draw

58
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:23,050
is chosen because I already covered I
don't have to buy anything and its CEO

59
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:32,520
of course but we need to attach the
essential to return the ugly baby I is

60
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:45,730
to avoid any any electronics so we will
have to find the videos it's some kind

61
00:13:45,730 --> 00:14:00,230
of beans on the road there they are
clear that we finally this is Mr so

62
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:10,910
letting we we see their serial port of
the reader in here with their house area

63
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:21,140
but some dubious means light the reader
lights so we can we can usually turn

64
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:35,790
lights for another purpose we have to to
emulate of us

65
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:53,370
that it cannot speak with essentials i2c
bus

66
00:14:53,370 --> 00:15:13,820
so I somewhere so we have to beat the
clock and data in this verse every to

67
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:20,730
those we can make a great deal to our
bus to communicate with essentials

68
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:36,540
directly so even if we have a physical
pass every two mins of the order we have

69
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:49,490
to load a special kernel module that
call at UCB there has to be france we

70
00:15:49,490 --> 00:16:10,899
with a special feeling where you know

71
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:26,069
of flash memory of the reuter required
is quite small so you have to take care

72
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:42,209
not overloaded communication that we
have compared to see the city the serial

73
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:58,529
port of the reuter help resumed control
terminal so because you have already

74
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:13,760
thrown when we're able to to recover the
route from this week we don't use for

75
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:31,740
that but we used to sing comments later
we motion we have failed

76
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:51,210
to get there so we do have to play with
the jury essential reading so you wait

77
00:17:51,210 --> 00:18:01,290
at the time and you live again so the
difference at election time so you have

78
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:06,250
to realize that

79
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,330
kilometres km/h

80
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:26,610
so you have to do with this calculation
and you need the way they're winning is

81
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,809
like this

82
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:41,570
Chinese version it only has a three-axis
accelerometer I just think I'll just

83
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:48,649
stick to what bothers you can send a
cause

84
00:18:48,650 --> 00:19:02,680
the experimental reasons not to table so
we need for this motion the

85
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:14,250
accelerometer has no really so we need a
compact but the snow is not mandatory so

86
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:23,330
to read this ensures it is necessary to
to make a C programming side there that

87
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:31,040
read essential make calculations and
said the commercial models like

88
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,029
everything Linux we will have

89
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:36,300
to redeem

90
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:45,899
like a standard fight but we have to use
the special command to send our what are

91
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:56,470
the risks we have to so once we have all
the readings of our senses we have to

92
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:05,660
assume them to do something to get i two
things

93
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:12,740
banger and they were right then we are
able to directly found a used car but

94
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:30,720
they're real anger respect around here
we have to have to integrate and make

95
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:40,169
sure everything so the simple are
worrying is like you see

96
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:45,239
in this line of code you take into
account

97
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:53,330
almost all of the reading from the shop
and a little bit from the accelerometer

98
00:20:53,330 --> 00:21:10,879
which is the Pullman filter but it's not
so we need something more complex its

99
00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:28,830
goal by dr. causing my tricks you can
find more information about that in the

100
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:35,820
economy and Peter become a leader was
the government and you must Sign year

101
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:41,760
how to to reach

102
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:59,450
the moon will make him this morning so
once readings and then we'll raid

103
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:15,370
absolutely angle and then we'll
isolation will have to got to take into

104
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:24,820
account so we can send a signal to
monitors so we need I'm just really

105
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:31,240
control Peace Corps proportional
integral derivative controller it's

106
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:43,790
going we're like receiving their life
but in fact this is to have a new Hannah

107
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:52,590
and anger and they recite anger I have
to stay in zero degrees but I mister in

108
00:22:52,590 --> 00:23:04,070
10 degrees higher res 10 degrees so we
take Ben 10 degrees so we we made it

109
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:18,240
plain error with a number what number is
we have to try so we're trying

110
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:27,210
but it's not sufficient to stabilize the
because i buy

111
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:37,309
decrease in over so I go to their
website so I have to take into account

112
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:48,410
this fact we need the internal time we
need to take into account how much time

113
00:23:48,410 --> 00:24:06,270
with their if I think half an hour for
33 degrees so much time we can grab by

114
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:12,080
mister with bringing talking their
overtime and we multiply them with

115
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:26,610
another factor what doctor will have to
try again so is there anybody we have to

116
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:37,049
take into account all the things that go
fast reaching my my my

117
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:46,190
seal the grease if i if i moving too
fast I will so we have to think talk

118
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:52,499
around that time too and we have to
multiply with another term that I will

119
00:24:52,499 --> 00:25:15,659
have to test so irate and another for
the absolute England withdrawn yourself

120
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:32,109
you can see how we delimiter to spin
their root there since I R comin thro

121
00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:39,730
the serial port to microcontroller the
microcontroller reach the common and

122
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,620
since

123
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:51,689
signal to voters to air controllers the
signal is fixable work I'm so we need to

124
00:25:51,690 --> 00:26:01,080
get need to be real time so we need to
process the comments very fast very

125
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:20,720
precisely to the reuter has to be the
main problem magruder after we accept

126
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:30,200
being too and we need a real diamond
scoville of the kernel we need to to say

127
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:40,460
scape does a very good day the process
to we priority so we have to integrate

128
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:53,900
terms except I'm so this color of the
Linux can get messed up so one professor

129
00:26:53,900 --> 00:27:03,929
we can kiss everything is there watching
Dr the watchdog timeout error where is

130
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:15,190
it doesn't matter if their hands that's
the below is no it's not important

131
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:28,150
because it is their house their drunk
asses so we need to avoid them so we we

132
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:37,220
cancel or we combine McCann without the
words or so

133
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:55,659
a few bars I have to buy because I don't
suffer spare one thing is interesting I

134
00:27:55,659 --> 00:28:09,659
did wrong it doesn't need any obligation
to control because we have we can send

135
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:22,490
the command structure where request so
we we can send throw away and we can

136
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:34,280
certainly and server is quite small so
the survey need to process this creation

137
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:52,740
very fast so do you got to the web
server in the coal washed away process

138
00:28:52,740 --> 00:29:02,929
very fast so we send them to a certain
region and in central Maine control

139
00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:27,810
situation is that ok release broken so

140
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,100
so

141
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:54,300
you read what they do there and you can
read my uniform and it's quite simple

142
00:29:54,300 --> 00:30:06,070
well this is quite annoying because I
want to but that they do is be control

143
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:17,800
to the tablet but we need to talk radio
module that he's no no way these in any

144
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:24,169
fundraising event that is quite annoying
that I had to recompile the Android

145
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:37,240
entirely only but I can imagine that
these killer or something so I decide to

146
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:44,430
do so another reuter know the 22 link
saying I know them all in the reuter

147
00:30:44,430 --> 00:31:03,789
because I don't want to recompile an
underage entirely so

148
00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:28,639
when I switch on a truck and I do so
they seem to indicate your own pockets

149
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:40,809
so anything wrong with WiFi throughout
this this kind of attack you have no

150
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:48,519
control is somebody send you their
dedication pocket so I decided to make

151
00:31:48,519 --> 00:32:03,629
my own wifi brother you can see the
control interesting in monitor mode and

152
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:05,309
it since the comments

153
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:17,109
throw frames I have to to make a force
package will be gone frames and inject

154
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:23,989
them throughout their wifi but if I
inject the packets in plain text i I am

155
00:32:23,989 --> 00:32:32,779
I am willing to do the other attack you
can take the packet and recently so we

156
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:43,599
need to 28 that packets to avoid
rejection so we got to drinking without

157
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:50,649
a doubt its pre-sale throw their normal
protocol and in the interests in a

158
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:58,469
monitor mode so all the comments I want
to send encrypted with this case we have

159
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,320
a day

160
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:09,760
if you turn around your laptop's you
will see two teenagers

161
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:17,280
proposed network and the other bus
network is the normal standard network

162
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,280
Special K

163
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:32,280
israel is the way that telemetry reduced
to a public but the control system

164
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:40,080
the reuter since before it becomes
frames and you can save this nation

165
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:55,129
because is not a reason I mysteries is
not possible because ik wil is broken

166
00:33:55,130 --> 00:34:06,490
during the trip so if you want to to see
their drones flying we can make their

167
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:14,469
own the rights takes you see you come to
touch me and I will try but you can see

168
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:30,399
internet there

169
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,009
so thank you very much
