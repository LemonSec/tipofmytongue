1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
you have the floor yeah I do hi everyone

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,759
it's a pleasure to be at BOTS conf this

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,470
year we try to do something special I

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,050
know after today and a half of good talk

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,259
you're a little bit pinning a botnet

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,779
fatigue so we try to take a another tech

7
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,330
on it which is more like data mining and

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,890
more like big picture oriented and show

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,800
you some statistic of for some of the

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,340
botnet we track what we see and which is

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,869
a specific topic that most of you have

12
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:33,809
never heard of we asked kindly that if

13
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,760
you tweet about it do not name any

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,770
actors do not name we are tracking them

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,440
and not taking a screenshot of the slide

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,809
please we know that people are actively

17
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,640
monitoring its internet and we don't

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,680
want them to tip them out and they've

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,390
been hidden in the shadow forever like

20
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,340
seven or eight years now so we would

21
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,219
like to have them think they are still

22
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,920
in the shadow so please do not wait too

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,680
much about it or if you do do not

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,960
provide any details thank you so today

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,969
we're not going to talk about one bot

26
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,709
we're not even going to talk about one

27
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,439
botnet we are going to talk about what

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,659
happened when you have a group of actors

29
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,369
who have bought and decide to band

30
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,970
together to do some sort of nefarious

31
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,880
purposes so this is Joe Michelle and I

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,670
merely we are both from the google aunty

33
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,979
a beauty and research team and the talk

34
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,840
will be about traffic exchange bot net

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,290
so why did we decide to talk about

36
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,420
traffic exchange today it's a fairly old

37
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,570
threat we believe it came from something

38
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,180
around 2000 a tour 2007 it was around

39
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,520
that being said it has been under the

40
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,619
shadow since then and probably because

41
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,509
it had built only very big providers at

42
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,180
the beginning and so there is no public

43
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,680
documentation even if you go to the

44
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,810
wikipedia page the wikipedia page is

45
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,280
absolutely completely wrong or what it

46
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,170
does so there is very very little

47
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,450
information about that at the same time

48
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,390
we have been tracking a proliferation of

49
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,219
those type of abuse over the last two

50
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,630
years and we believe that is going to

51
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,119
break through and you will hear more and

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,380
more about it and there will be more and

53
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,689
more group using this kind of thing so

54
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,758
reason for that is when you traffic

55
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,619
exchange you are basically putting

56
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:11,910
resources from different

57
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,590
oops which make its way more resilient

58
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,210
to take down and different harder to

59
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,930
detect because they are mixing target

60
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,870
and infrastructure into one poor so this

61
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,450
is why traffic exchange is too important

62
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,160
so how it works are you should go to

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,750
Wikipedia page you go to any of those

64
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,190
traffic exchange you'll see something

65
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,490
like this go upload your website then

66
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,700
you dutifully watch you know the site of

67
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,800
other people and then the other people

68
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,450
are really nice to you and go back and

69
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,730
go to your website or a big you

70
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,920
basically get traffic you scratch your

71
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,780
back I scratch yours and we all do

72
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,570
benefits right that is the official

73
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,910
pitch of course if should try to dig

74
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,370
deeper this is not how it works what

75
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,020
happened is you do submit your website

76
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,900
and you do unroll your BOTS through the

77
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,700
traffic exchange by adding a module

78
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,940
usually a Windows module and then your

79
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,310
boat will go and visit the website not

80
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,560
you and then that's why you scare and

81
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,530
then you earn what we could minutes then

82
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,540
those minutes can be spent to actually

83
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,820
get other people who have bought to

84
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,650
visit the site of your choosing using

85
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,300
the user agent you want and so forth and

86
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,270
so basically you can do traffic exchange

87
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,270
as a middleman who helps criminal to

88
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,459
band together and exchange resources you

89
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,170
have somebody I have some buds I want

90
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,640
more traffic you want more traffic let's

91
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,220
just exchange traffic and they are

92
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,300
basically the middleman so a 50,000 view

93
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,970
feed you of what it is is like this you

94
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,920
have a traffic exchange and you want all

95
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,709
your BOTS and use it in your website and

96
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,660
you say here's what I want traffic to

97
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,550
and here's my bots which going to the

98
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,130
traffic for me the other guy do exactly

99
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,640
the same take his boat and haul them to

100
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,989
traffic asian server and put their

101
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:57,420
website and then of course you get a ton

102
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,280
of traffic going all around right and

103
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,500
left with poofing and so forth in you

104
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,130
get this huge amount of traffic going up

105
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,780
back and forth on the internet which is

106
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,130
of course all fake a video game version

107
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,190
of this would be this this is basically

108
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,410
what we see for some of the group on the

109
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,000
left side you have the IP addresses on

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,978
the right side you have the target and

111
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,530
you see his huge amount of traffic which

112
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,000
is all faker this is basically the

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,020
arcade version

114
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,569
all traffic actions look like and you

115
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:30,360
see all those traffic around around if

116
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,129
you ever wonder why you have your onion

117
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:33,479
traffic eating some of your website

118
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,970
that's probably why as it is a traffic

119
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:46,800
actions but net so what do we care we

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,449
try to care about that because we saw a

121
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:50,940
lot of people say hey I'm a fantastic

122
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,560
SEO firm i'm going to give you

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,780
legitimate us only visitor we are

124
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,630
traffic for 30 days so i don't know your

125
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,419
visitor wake up to 30 days and then they

126
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,460
would be real because it may be fake and

127
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,020
you i would say that four to five

128
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,520
dollars and then the other guy would say

129
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,020
wealth and you real traffic coming from

130
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,569
google search of course so basically you

131
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:11,849
have a lot of shady agency who instead

132
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:13,770
of doing any black cat secret techniques

133
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,449
to get traffic to your website all they

134
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,000
do is go through those guy easier and

135
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,800
rolled balls for pesos guy and then

136
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,490
should traffic and then it's even more

137
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,960
toxic than that there is many many

138
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,909
reason why this thing is really bad the

139
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,590
first one is we also have google clown

140
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,120
and we have been spending a lot of VMS

141
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,349
which are basically pay with stolen

142
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:36,000
credit card which runs those kind of

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,800
bots so it's a way for people to

144
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,810
actually lender credit cards that's one

145
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,919
of the way you would run run the

146
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,860
restaurant credit cards you will rent

147
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,039
some VMS on major provider put about one

148
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,289
minute then we take down the bots about

149
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:50,849
the money stay the same because you have

150
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:52,800
converted your credit card effectively

151
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,599
in two minutes and then your minutes can

152
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:56,400
be used for any traffic so basically you

153
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,469
i bought to cash in on credit card it

154
00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:00,360
might not be the most efficient way you

155
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,490
lose a lot of money like it don't get

156
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,930
one or one daughter but you still get

157
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,279
something out of credit card so that's

158
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,690
something we have been seeing

159
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,659
increasingly are happening some of the

160
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:11,490
guy also try to use those methods and

161
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,680
those bouts to the traffic and add add

162
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,949
fraud of course then we have seen a few

163
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:18,870
and more and more special actually

164
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,310
traffic actions who try to the view con

165
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,250
gaming so people want to affect use try

166
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,520
to make the apparent of fame that's

167
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,349
another thing as well as envoye that and

168
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:31,199
as we said the early reason for those

169
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,389
were black hat SEO technique where you

170
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,460
have traffic bumping and we have people

171
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,880
say oh I I have this

172
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,560
that's it crack them technique on Google

173
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,230
I'm able to get 10,000 visitors a day to

174
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,180
know this is not 10,000 visitors this is

175
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,250
just the analytic believing you have

176
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,260
visitor whether they do just visits day

177
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,870
and so forth so that's basically why we

178
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,050
care people who an impacted beside us a

179
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,090
lot of people are impacted for instance

180
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,910
you have a sink provider is your hosting

181
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,560
computer and you see credit card fraud

182
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,750
some of it is probably due to traffic

183
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,310
exchange because we say seven during

184
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,350
money scheme if you are corporate

185
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,110
network we see also boss coming from isp

186
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,060
and copyright network so maybe someone

187
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,250
has winningly on unwittingly install one

188
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,140
of the software sometimes they are a

189
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,510
package with other software and finally

190
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,580
show a site owner and you have SEO

191
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,070
consultant some of them might not be as

192
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,290
legit as you think and your super

193
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,970
increase of spike of traffic might not

194
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,530
be what you think get it so this is

195
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,050
traffic exchange for you whose benefit

196
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,760
from it always very interesting to as

197
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,470
the question who's makes money out of it

198
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,330
the third guy who make money is a

199
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,220
traffic exchange owner so what it does

200
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,130
is the middleman what he does is he

201
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,080
actually said extra minute work shall

202
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,410
visit from the traffic action so he make

203
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,940
people pay if you don't have enough but

204
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,260
well you turned out what you can pay for

205
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,500
it so he makes me that way black get

206
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,780
this relative who resell it add folder

207
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,600
and press calendar of course the funny

208
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,180
stories because it's of course a scam

209
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,920
you have scammers scamming the scammer

210
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,470
so we also have people who will resell

211
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,360
you directly minutes also

212
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,270
stratifications for a price so this is

213
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,960
creating this circle of nefariousness

214
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,360
where people are like oh I scam you guys

215
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,190
and I still knew about and so forth so

216
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,010
that's basically a full ecosystem at the

217
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,080
moment that's why we we think it's time

218
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,430
for people to pay more attention to it

219
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,170
it's like a fully fledged understood

220
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,380
system at least in the underground so

221
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,940
now i'm going to let Johnny shelter you

222
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,100
little bit more about concrete actor in

223
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,570
the space so you get a better sense of

224
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,429
what is the to showcase examples we

225
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,580
choose to bots jingling also known as

226
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,809
url url spirit and hit lip we choose

227
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,390
those two first because some of the bots

228
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,460
were running on Google Cloud and we are

229
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,820
actively fighting them

230
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,220
and secondly because even if they

231
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,100
provide some kind of service the way

232
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,870
their product providing that they have

233
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,850
different mindset different networks

234
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,950
different capabilities so we thought to

235
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,860
be interesting to you to show that

236
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,630
jingling is the oldest one it's from

237
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,140
2008 from China if it is more recent

238
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,770
only five years old but as you can see

239
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,590
even if jingling is yoga school in its

240
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,480
eye it's only representing 15,000 BOTS

241
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,590
whereas it leap as 50 as a 50,000 which

242
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,810
means basically that heat leap is more

243
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,760
popular because keep in mind that the

244
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,830
bots on at home buying the network the

245
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,840
network is just the mean of connecting

246
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,650
bots together so as a client of a flip

247
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,860
you have to provide your own box and

248
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,320
that also explain why it leap could be

249
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,470
cheaper because if they have more BOTS

250
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,180
they don't need to make as much money

251
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,930
per baat as the as jingling has this is

252
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,990
the ue the UI of jingling it's very

253
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,270
crowded very technical for example

254
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,610
they're not speaking about minutes or

255
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,740
number of visits they are speaking about

256
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:06,620
IPs and before 2015 DUI only existed in

257
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,930
Chinese and we believe they are using

258
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,600
automated translation tool because on

259
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,060
the arrow you can see top up which is

260
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,200
the translation for get more minutes not

261
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,460
better used to it you understand every

262
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,830
aspect of the visit can be configured in

263
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,200
some menus this one allows you to

264
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,900
configure geoip location from where the

265
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,870
bots will come and you have tons of

266
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,850
settings on jingling that you can play

267
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,260
with on the other hand a flip it's

268
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:49,670
pretty web 2.genares.net site you set

269
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,210
the refer that you want to spoof done

270
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,760
all the technical details are our end

271
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,310
all in the background by eight leap it's

272
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,780
hidden from the user so it's more

273
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,180
oriented for the for the end user for

274
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,990
SEO X

275
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,850
such father might not understand the

276
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:10,550
technique because of that it's not

277
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,890
impossible that webmasters using this

278
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,470
web interface Billy that they are trying

279
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,810
to sell it you to buy some real traffic

280
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:23,360
real organic traffic not box this

281
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,970
comparison also shows the the amount of

282
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,980
capabilities that you can set in

283
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,330
jingling you can push custom user agents

284
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,670
that you want to spoof you can select

285
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,550
the GOI people and you can also set up

286
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,040
the custom window size the reefer

287
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,880
spoofing is used to be able to make

288
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,520
analytic tools believe that the traffic

289
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,320
comes from reputable sources such as

290
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,070
Google Facebook Bing usual junk spoofing

291
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:57,140
will allow better spreading of the of

292
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:04,940
the sources look sorry and this is don't

293
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,339
to make believe the energetic tools that

294
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:09,950
the traffic is more organic you will

295
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:15,730
have mobile phone call me etc script and

296
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,760
javascript and flash is don't you for to

297
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,040
elude the website VF properly so you

298
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,420
will get all the resources and things

299
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,339
like that and the custom windows size

300
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:27,860
because obviously when you're trying to

301
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,260
spoof an iphone you don't want to

302
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:35,380
advertise a fifteen hundreds widescreen

303
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,959
even though jingling as more technical

304
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,600
technical capabilities the technology

305
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,310
that they're using is older they're

306
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,079
still relying on the internet explorer

307
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:48,380
come component where as equally used a

308
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,020
specific version of chromium CEF which

309
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,300
is chromium embedded framework used to

310
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,130
do headless browsing so it will be

311
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,430
faster it will be a bit more secure and

312
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,279
still you see that they don't care about

313
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,050
encrypting the local settings so this

314
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,810
this confirms that it leap is mirror is

315
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,900
more focused on the end user they might

316
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,830
have some tech savvy team to choose to

317
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:19,780
brand new framework to use if we look at

318
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,880
the aggregate view of where the bots are

319
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,490
located a third of the traffic comes

320
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,850
from the US and that's because they are

321
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,710
abusing cloud and VPS providers most of

322
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,130
the time to recycle credit cards that

323
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,770
got stolen by machines and get money out

324
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:40,120
of it then we can see machines from

325
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,580
South America Brazil and Venezuela which

326
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,010
is a bit a bit odd because it's not that

327
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,140
easy to get an IP from South Africa

328
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,910
regarding VPS Austin su and we're also

329
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:55,830
we also go a bit surprised to not see a

330
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:59,230
friends of Canada which our data centers

331
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,710
heavy countries in the top five if we

332
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,280
break down by by the BART system we can

333
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,290
see that each leap is really focused on

334
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,160
the US off of the bots come from there

335
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,380
whereas jingling is spreaded all over

336
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,540
the world it has better word coverage

337
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,940
which men which also means that from

338
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,320
jingling you will get better traffic

339
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,990
coming there are people also from Iran

340
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,900
and Spain which are only using jingling

341
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,260
they're not this group of actors doesn't

342
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,630
seem to have joined it lip yet at least

343
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,470
not with huge proportions if we look at

344
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:42,750
where the bottle or stood club providers

345
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,060
are the main contributors especially

346
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,140
with Amazon you also see that from

347
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,170
Middle East and South America the bots

348
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,260
are coming from I Spees so it could be

349
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,210
workstation that got compromised and the

350
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,620
bots in style in the background or

351
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,960
people deliberately trying to make money

352
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,360
out of it by installing the software on

353
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,870
their own computer and you can see also

354
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,790
that Google Cloud is present on the

355
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,190
graph but the figures are a bit lower

356
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,030
because we are removing them and bottles

357
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,280
who are shared between it taking it lip

358
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,330
and jingling we found some VM instances

359
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,320
running both of them and i will talk i

360
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,420
will let le talk about the last question

361
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,399
that remains what kind of website

362
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,709
benefits from it and I'll targeted by

363
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:35,200
those BOTS okay so what do you do with

364
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,360
those traffic action here's to example

365
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,370
these are not known but these are like

366
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,709
visual ideas of like what did some of

367
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:42,730
the new things that people are trying to

368
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,040
do is I try to do fig juice of course it

369
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,779
doesn't work because the bud did not

370
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,300
click on the video but you know yeah one

371
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,360
can try so there is one for YouTube of

372
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,639
course with when one of the target the

373
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,370
other guy is another website pull you

374
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,110
independent music I think it's just to

375
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,000
boost the rating so this kind of the

376
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,370
target we see but these are not the norm

377
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,160
if you take the top advertise or the top

378
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,839
requested URL so these are people for

379
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,740
the most minutes we see that on jingling

380
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,110
one guy try really hard to abuse ads

381
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,589
back and then there is quite a few game

382
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:21,839
related affiliate or add food related

383
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,910
abuse on the heat lips eyes the two

384
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,750
first one are probably a SEO agency

385
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,610
because it is a rotating portal where

386
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,930
you visit once and you get one and

387
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,310
websites you get another one you visit

388
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,050
them as a website so i think they do

389
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,459
their own custom rotation they might

390
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:37,990
have aggregated traffic from multiple

391
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,449
sources make them neatly so it's really

392
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:42,670
hard to know what they doing then they

393
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,670
shoot the traffic to some of the client

394
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,970
and then you have again a lot of output

395
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,519
interestingly we see bleeding between

396
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,190
the two as you can see the ads back guy

397
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,470
is in the top five is number one

398
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,720
engineering I was number one for a week

399
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,240
and it was also number seven or eight

400
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,970
into hit lip so those people basically

401
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,010
by traffic from Beaufort have brought in

402
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,859
both not quite sure sure but basically

403
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,209
these are just kind of some kind of

404
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:13,540
actors then being said there is quite a

405
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,429
bit of differences when you try to look

406
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:17,140
at the IP geolocation of the count of

407
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,959
the website of course muscle works that

408
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:22,660
are in the US but then you can see that

409
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,449
a jingling have a lot of chinese website

410
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:27,970
and we were quite puzzled by that but

411
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,270
then we found out it was it's actually

412
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,950
tell about so let me show you that in a

413
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,890
second before I get to that we need some

414
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,870
clustering of the type of abuse we see

415
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,970
and based on very sinal on the web pages

416
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,559
we have

417
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:43,600
and we believe that actually it's a

418
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,330
fifty fifty percent between SEO and

419
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,299
natural jingling being a little bit more

420
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:50,590
as food related fifty-five percent

421
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,809
versus forty-one percent and it'll be

422
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:55,480
more like a little bit more SEO

423
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,340
fifty-two percent versus forty five

424
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,830
percent for ad fraud we see a little bit

425
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,419
of malware and a little bit of unwanted

426
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:04,120
software also been as a target for those

427
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,399
websites we're not quite sure why it's

428
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:08,499
either because they buy traffic from

429
00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:10,149
someone else and it's a to help all

430
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:12,249
those guys really confused of what the

431
00:18:12,249 --> 00:18:13,809
thing is doing because obviously it will

432
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:15,999
not download the binary for you so not

433
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:17,559
quite sure why but we see some of them

434
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,809
are some unwanted software in both of

435
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:22,869
those if you try to a good bye Doug

436
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,330
domain then you see some specific see

437
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,220
emerge so jingling do love taobao

438
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,899
traffic so we don't for that is we

439
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:34,090
believe that double use a counter for

440
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,649
how many times the auction has been

441
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:37,899
viewed and the more auction is you the

442
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:39,460
more you would be high up into the

443
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,830
search for specific keywords we believe

444
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,269
that some of those guy have to go that

445
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:45,909
out and use basically jingling to

446
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:48,070
deserve the ranking into taobao in the

447
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,570
hope together auction being more

448
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,090
displayed prominently similarly we see a

449
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,009
bunch of people who are trying to use

450
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,490
simply to do fake view on YouTube

451
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,419
actually is this is something we see on

452
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:00,340
the don't read because there is the

453
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,759
emergence of specialized traffic actions

454
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,769
which has no choice on YouTube which are

455
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,869
quite a few of those so this is a dong

456
00:19:07,869 --> 00:19:10,360
trouble still visible by nosy I think

457
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,649
they have your eyes it doesn't work but

458
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:13,809
never know and so otherwise you have

459
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:16,980
your usual suspect all over the place so

460
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,289
take away from the talk this is complete

461
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:22,749
complex to combat because an interest

462
00:19:22,749 --> 00:19:25,119
group of actors you have both from all

463
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,039
over the country and one guy might guess

464
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,929
his bought from compromised computer one

465
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:30,399
guy might get it because she really

466
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:32,350
believe it's going to bring in value one

467
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,149
guy you stolen credit cards over the

468
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:37,509
pool of bots for each other's botnet are

469
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,309
very very different so there is no one

470
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:41,230
way to take them down it's really hard

471
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,629
to reach you people second one is we

472
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:45,309
believe is a stray dogs arise with so

473
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,110
quite an increase of those there was

474
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,960
like four or five a few years back and

475
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,600
auditor is like 20 25 of those guys so

476
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,220
some of them I obviously way bigger so

477
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,590
that much

478
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,789
smaller and some of them are specialized

479
00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:58,309
and again as we see it with no more

480
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:01,029
generic botnet with so people

481
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:03,080
specializing in to let's say you choose

482
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,299
for sharing specific ads part of the

483
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:07,190
thing and we believe those specialized

484
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,200
traffic asians will be on the rise for

485
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,090
the next two or three years so something

486
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,419
to keep an eye on before we close at OB

487
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:16,070
wanted to say a big thanks to many of

488
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,960
the people who have passed the traffic

489
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,510
add quality team which is in the room

490
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,490
thank you guys for the help they were

491
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,919
speaking last year we work out with well

492
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:26,150
the webspam team who helped us

493
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,919
understand better what's happening on

494
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,340
the SEO side and finally this is the

495
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,779
first talk on the subject but the

496
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:34,520
Burkett people we work with also wrote a

497
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,490
paper on botnet traffic and have like

498
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,020
this academic paper which explained in

499
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,909
more detail as in and out of traffic

500
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:43,370
action so if you're interested in it's

501
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,440
on the IMC 2015 website is called

502
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,750
traffic exchange is by berkeley so if

503
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,100
you enjoyed in the subject please do

504
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,429
read the paper it's friggin with that

505
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:54,200
will take some question if you have any

506
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,370
thank you very much for your

507
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:11,310
so questions in the middle are you

508
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,980
working with Amazon to help them remove

509
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,740
are we working with Amazon that's an

510
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,270
interesting question I know it's kind of

511
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,360
a conflict of interest possible I mean

512
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,380
there is no configure insurance of

513
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,000
security we we do with ok fight we do

514
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,070
work with actors that we believe are

515
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,340
infected and Amazon is one of any people

516
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,320
we will work with on abuse side we have

517
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,630
a specific agreement with Amazon no

518
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:44,400
comment other questions how long will

519
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,200
give a figure in custom made on droid

520
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,640
figure into people who ask questions so

521
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,070
I only have two so the guy who has the

522
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,960
first question thank you for the good

523
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,540
questions well there's suddenly a second

524
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:58,610
question see I had a question before a

525
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,990
major statement of course of course and

526
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,720
thanks for the talk and these are some

527
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,770
restrictions when you go on that traffic

528
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,580
exchange for the kind of website you can

529
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,590
advertise and ask all the buds to go to

530
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,340
because if not you just recruit new

531
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,010
boats by for example driving someone to

532
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,220
to an exploit kit website and then the

533
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,730
bots get infected by your malware too so

534
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,160
it depends there is no explicit it

535
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,690
depends on the traffic action for the

536
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,280
one which shows they have no specific

537
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,090
prohibition they do ask you to not

538
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,220
visiting our website if they do any type

539
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,810
of check on the background we don't know

540
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,790
I mean I don't know I've never tried to

541
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:51,930
exploit them and I probably go so you

542
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,210
know but we do see as we mentioned

543
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,980
people directing some of the boat to

544
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,530
traffic exchange to travel to some of

545
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,720
the drive-by download that has been

546
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,730
flagged by safe browsing so when we show

547
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,350
like on the grass now was that is

548
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,320
basically a few person to person who are

549
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,850
trying of course you know it's like so

550
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,020
they get kicked out by the traffic

551
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,960
exchange Eliza no I I do not run the

552
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,070
traffic ations I just

553
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,170
so that some of the target our flight by

554
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,820
Safe Browsing so we compare it to this

555
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,170
right and so that's how we did the

556
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,810
analytic waveguide so we see some of it

557
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,270
it's a funk tiny fraction it seems table

558
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,340
over the last watch we want three months

559
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,770
we looked at for the talk so someone

560
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,840
people are doing it so if you're using

561
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,670
hit lip be pretty good because you have

562
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,880
chrome if you're using jingling well you

563
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,910
know thank you and then you're still

564
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,910
window figuring thank you I think we

565
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,290
might even have one extra one maybe yep

566
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,700
sorry so next question is for free

567
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:55,460
questions detective Fuhrman okay go

568
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,100
check working ah thank you nice talk

569
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,850
actually uh I'm kind of know the subject

570
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,820
Elsa so the google it put away all other

571
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,840
search engines fight back hardly on the

572
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,620
black COO market and you block the

573
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,460
clients of those boats and recently at

574
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,140
least and last year year and a half

575
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,450
there was additional service that you

576
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:25,070
can you know put a obvious black co on

577
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,070
your compound your on-site you don't you

578
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,110
don't own but you want you know to get

579
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:34,710
down on the search engines and it became

580
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,290
a real problem because at least in

581
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,410
Google you cannot call Google as a no

582
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,380
please it's not me something is sort of

583
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,350
DDoSing me any any recommendations for

584
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,960
those victims yeah so to rephrase the

585
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,540
question what you refer to is what we

586
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,580
call weaponization of botnet for

587
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,320
basically taking down your competitors

588
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,570
we sit for many things with it for web

589
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:00,330
spam we sit also for ads we saw some

590
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,940
people actually try to exhaust the

591
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,590
bidding pool from the competitor just to

592
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,900
make sure they can go up on we see that

593
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,660
all the time there is a way a there is a

594
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,610
way for you to appear to the webmaster

595
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,590
tool you can appeal and say this is not

596
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,660
my fault and then we will take it into

597
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,450
consideration we'll review it with we do

598
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,010
we have actually people working on it

599
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,050
and we doing each cases sometime it's

600
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,600
not a special you would love but we try

601
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,850
to do it secondly

602
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,010
we do our best with intelligence we have

603
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,960
to actually not denies people if we

604
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,820
don't think they are winning and doing

605
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,180
it that means it is extremely hot topic

606
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,450
right i mean we've seen that time and

607
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,940
time again took our project we are aware

608
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,870
of it again imperfect aware of it trying

609
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,910
to do our best and if you really have

610
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,260
this problem goes to the webmaster tool

611
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,770
you can actually feel an appeal so one

612
00:25:52,770 --> 00:26:00,870
more question oh okay hi first of all

613
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,090
thank you I really enjoyed your talk and

614
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,030
I was wondering if you know other actors

615
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,360
and if you looked into them yes we do we

616
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,150
know as we said around 20 some of them

617
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,560
are specialized into specific product

618
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,200
some of them are more like generic we do

619
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,600
i will mention one if you want auto

620
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,940
surfer which probably the oldest one and

621
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,170
still active we have a butcher which is

622
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,730
one of the newcomer which is really

623
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,800
active on youtube so that is quite a few

624
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,590
I wish we said there was actually two or

625
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,050
three and then to watch few years ago we

626
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,280
think it's actually tied to rise if

627
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,070
there is night Mel 20 and this is that

628
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,720
coming up that's why we come to you guys

629
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,360
and say hey guys it was like them

630
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,980
messing up with Google now we believe is

631
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,780
messing up with the world it's a 2am one

632
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,880
more infected computer I mean so

633
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,610
probably time for everyone to to keep an

634
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:54,810
eye on it thank you okay last question

635
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,290
here

636
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,899
and you've said that those boats are

637
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:06,789
using a kind of embedded browsers like

638
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:10,179
embedded the chrome and ie so my

639
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:13,179
question is I do have some techniques

640
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:17,590
that let you detect that the browser is

641
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,600
one of those when it interact with a

642
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,539
website like it the request came from

643
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:27,249
embedded chromium or embedded ie yes

644
00:27:27,249 --> 00:27:30,330
when you have some tactics thank you

645
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:34,480
you're welcome sorry sorry this is like

646
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,240
super sensitive yes as there are ways I

647
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,619
think many people have come up with

648
00:27:38,619 --> 00:27:40,360
different way strong so you joined the

649
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,279
year one I would mention though because

650
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:45,850
public there is an interesting to a blog

651
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:48,759
post by I'm sorry I don't remember his

652
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:50,919
name so if you don't I'm very sorry but

653
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,690
the guy I extended the passive voice

654
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,090
finger printer to actually add ssl

655
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,580
fingerprinting and turned out that if

656
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,960
you have chrome off you have IE you have

657
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,200
a specific set of cipher suite and the

658
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,789
other is very specific so if you

659
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:05,409
actually run pacifies finger and printer

660
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:09,220
you can really clearly see those

661
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,019
automation because they don't update

662
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:15,789
them very often so yeah you finger

663
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:18,039
pretty as hell on giant photos and it's

664
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:20,860
very hard to see iOS for instance is

665
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,059
very different from on the radio from

666
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:24,249
for my so that's one which is public so

667
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:29,789
here when we can talk about thank you

668
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,330
