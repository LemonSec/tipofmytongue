00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,240
we were speaking about an issue

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,799
with the slides the thing is that i put

34
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,320
a couple of pictures in my slide you

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,439
know that we

36
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,840
more attractive or more attractive but

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,560

46
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,200
too much detail

47
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,440
who does nothing about the european

48
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,480
commission

49
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,560
can you raise your hands right

50
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,520

51
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:29,920
shy

52
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,120
i mean it's possible okay

53
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,400
thank you very much sorry let's go

54
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,080
so again my name is lauren vele

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,800
and i'm working for this big institution

56
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,680
uh

57
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,599
the commission and in the commission you

58
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,840
have a series of directorate general

59
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,160
covering numerous fields from

60
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,799
energy to agriculture to

61
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,120
information society home affairs etc etc

62
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,760
most of these dgs are what we call poly

63
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,800
cdg

64
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,120
they are building proposing

65
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,840
not deciding proposing a new piece of

66
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,120
legislation

67
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,840
uh to the member states and other

68
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,519
european institutions like the european

69
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,480
parliament

70
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,080
or the council which then decides

71
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,599
and votes on this proposal

72
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,080
so most of these dg are doing this

73
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,360
legislative works

74
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,000
and there are also few dgs who are

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,159
providing services

76
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,319
and the john research center is one of

77
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,440
them it's by the way the biggest one

78
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,560
uh with uh okay this is the outline i

79
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,840
already spoke about it

80
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,200
um is the biggest one with

81
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,879
three thousand almost three thousand

82
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,440
people and we are more or less

83
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,680
the commission in-house uh science

84
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,560
services so we are providing uh

85
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,439
supports uh technological support or

86
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,000
science

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
support to the other dg whenever you

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,560
have a new piece of legislation on

89
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,760
i don't know let's say smart grid

90
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
we are conducting some research some

91
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,680
analysis technological analysis

92
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,720
assessments

93
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,000
on emerging technology related to smart

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,680
grids we are testing

95
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,720
some system in order for the

96
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,840
new piece of legislation to be uh

97
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,000
more relevant for sure it's very

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,280
relevant all the time but

99
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,479
and stick to the to the to the trends of

100
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,759
of technology

101
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,639
okay this is the usual mandatory family

102
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,759
pictures

103
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,120
um on the top left uh you have the big

104
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,680
boss the president of the commission

105
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,600
john claude juncker and is

106
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,000
managing a college of 28 commissioner

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,040
coming from the 28 mom states

108
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,400
and we under the supervision

109
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,479
of two commissioners the one on

110
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,160
education culture and youth

111
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,800
and the one of course on research

112
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,400
science and innovation

113
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,720
and last but not least of course if he's

114
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,560
listening to me today

115
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,199
my director general vladimir sukha who

116
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,960
is managing

117
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,080
the old dgs as i said

118
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,680
3 000 people seven research centers

119
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,639
spread all over europe but with a

120
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,240
historical

121
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,720
initial point where we are based

122
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,479
apostolos and i

123
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,039
in the north of italy ispra a small

124
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:33,759
village

125
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,120
in front of the lake lago madre

126
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,199
a very difficult place as you will see

127
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,639
in a minute um

128
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,759
so as i said seven research institutes

129
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,479
covering a different research field

130
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,320
historically in the 50s

131
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,880
the the grc was launched uh

132
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,759
triggered by some needs on on nuclear

133
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,319
research

134
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,360
so uh a nuclear research reactor has

135
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,080
been built

136
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,680
uh in israel you know in our premise

137
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,720
and progressively uh the science field

138
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,919
have been extended

139
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,759
to science recently has been extended to

140
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,479
several field of research as i said life

141
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,039
science

142
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,720
transports energy health and

143
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,800
uh the institute for for which we are

144
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,639
working apostolos and i

145
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,000
the institute for the protection and

146
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,680
security of the citizen

147
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,880
which is covering again a series of uh

148
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,080
fields uh ranging from

149
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,360
let's say natural disaster earthquake

150
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,440
so for example we have a six-floor

151
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,280
building we are shaking from time to

152
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,160
time

153
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,360
um in in the premise and but also

154
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,039
critical infrastructure information

155
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,840
society critical infrastructure

156
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,199
and there are six units and one of these

157
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:53,759
units

158
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,639
or units is the digital citizen security

159
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,280
unit

160
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,840
which is more focused on the last mile

161
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,000
the citizen

162
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,360
and the the the let's say

163
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,360
yeah digital security of this citizen

164
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,599
this is a brief summary of uh

165
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,319
the projects the topic we are covering

166
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,720
in this unit

167
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,120
so it's organized around three kinds of

168
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,000
pillars

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,720
the first one the team i'm in charge of

170
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,680
which is

171
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,880
everything well technology for law

172
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,599
enforcement

173
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,880
more or less we have three domain

174
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,680
the first one one of the most important

175
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,960
of my team

176
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,039
it's about how to

177
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,879
facilitate enhance increase improve

178
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,720
the identification of authors and

179
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,879
victims of child sexual abuse

180
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,039
mainly through computer vision image

181
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,639
analytics

182
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,039
the second one which is related to our

183
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,479
topic today

184
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,440
it's about possible innovative

185
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,800
techniques for fighting

186
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,479
cyber crime and crime in general

187
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,840
and i mentioned three of them um i will

188
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,360
not speak about the two first one

189
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,879
communication interception and

190
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,479
decryption

191
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,840
and i will focus on mobile botnets

192
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
all of these techniques we are studying

193
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,440
we are trying to develop from time to

194
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,970
time

195
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,280
[Music]

196
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,680
the the very first motivation we have

197
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,280
whenever we are

198
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,680
spanning our energy on that is of course

199
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,479
to get

200
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,360
the most privacy friendly techniques

201
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,599
which will respect

202
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,559
the eu charter for fundamental right and

203
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,039
especially the article 7 and the article

204
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,919
8

205
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,800
on privacy and data protection last but

206
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,320
not least of my team

207
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
some activity on biometrics and large

208
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,240
quality system

209
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,120
this is unfortunately a quite a recent

210
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,800
topic high in the news so how to improve

211
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,839
the performance

212
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,800
of biometric systems such as

213
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,480
fingerprints readers

214
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,600
we are trying to develop or to let's say

215
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,920
further study for example touchless

216
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,399
fingerprint reader or any alternative

217
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,200
kind of

218
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,880
rhythm okay and then the other part of

219
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,320
the units are working on

220
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,760
trust security identity uh privacy and

221
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,440
data protection measures of course

222
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,959
uh um maybe one word about intelligent

223
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,160
transport system

224
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,040
and especially the digital tachograph in

225
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,920
europe

226
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,800
the let's say nine million trucks uh

227
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,279
have

228
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,640
a small black box in order to check and

229
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,519
verify

230
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,920
the good application of the working

231
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,120
condition so

232
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,440
under a certain number of hours the

233
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,880
truck driver should

234
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,360
stop the track we are the european root

235
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,720
certificate authority

236
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,880
to secure this this black box

237
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,640
this is one of the activity of our units

238
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,959
okay let's move to the second part of

239
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:05,440
this

240
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,360
uh this is a little advertisement this

241
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,079
is by by the way or or research center

242
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:10,959
so

243
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,120
as i say it's a very difficult place as

244
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,880
you can see in front of the lake

245
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,920
the big area six kilometer diameter in

246
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,480
front of a small village of ispram

247
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,680
um yes i have spammed the

248
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,040
alumni uh botcom

249
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,399
mailing list with this advertisements uh

250
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,279
let me add a couple of more information

251
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,200
which was not in the job opportunities

252
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,480
description

253
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,200
uh we have the biggest of italy the

254
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,920
biggest

255
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,200
uh triathlon club uh

256
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,600
[Music]

257
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,839
of all italy and that's true you can

258
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,800
verify

259
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,920
we have a super very active ski club as

260
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,959
you can imagine

261
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,519
uh with the the picture behind this is

262
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,800
the monte rosa

263
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,720
4 6433 meters

264
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,240
which offer us a lot of opportunities

265
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,160
last but not least my favorite sport

266
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,839
sailing this is

267
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,560
also something we can do between the

268
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,320
lunch break

269
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,959
or right after the job core working

270
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,079
hours we have to respect

271
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,959
of course a little bit more seriously

272
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,959
there is a deadline 10 of december we

273
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,880
are looking for a mobile.net analyst

274
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,640
please do not hesitate to come back to

275
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,279
me

276
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,519
or to go to this website uh if if

277
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,320
you want to enjoy the environment but

278
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,079
not only of course

279
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,600
if you are looking at doing such kind of

280
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,440
things which is listed here i don't want

281
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,320
to spend too much time on that

282
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,640
yes we cannot compete with private

283
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,240
company let's be clear

284
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,200
frank open we have other attractive

285
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,160
elements

286
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,760
let me underline as well that we are

287
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,399
very closely cooperating with law

288
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,480
enforcement national law enforcement

289
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,720
but also uh and in particular uh herbal

290
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
so this is also an opportunity for

291
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,079
people who are working with us

292
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,279
to have uh um yes

293
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,399
and an interesting access to uh

294
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,240
what is going on from an operational

295
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,000
point of view related to this uh

296
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,519
technology and and and situation

297
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,200
okay um now the

298
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,320
real purpose of my talk

299
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,399
i'm afraid yeah we will have time for

300
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,240
question and this is the most important

301
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,880
and

302
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,480
really the objective of my talk is to

303
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
get your feedback because again

304
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,880
we have advertised this uh during the

305
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,360
preparatory step of the conference

306
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,560
where that it starts uh yeah we we

307
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,760
participated

308
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,959
we gave a talk during the first bot conf

309
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,160
in nantes and it was great

310
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,959
and then we thought ah we we definitely

311
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,959
need to do more than than just a talk

312
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,959
which is already something of course

313
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,040
but um so we came back to eric and

314
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,760
we tried to find something which will uh

315
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,160
help

316
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,200
support the community and which will not

317
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,519
be

318
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,920
specifically money because of course

319
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
money is super important

320
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,839
but as i said we are public institution

321
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,120
doesn't mean that we don't have money

322
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,680
but

323
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,120
it's a long step it's a long process to

324
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,560
provide money and we have already a lot

325
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,079
of uh procedure for that just to name

326
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,880
one the horizon 2020

327
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,680
projects please apply there is a website

328
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,000
for that as well

329
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,760
there are great opportunity to be

330
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,200
financed in order to conduct your

331
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,120
research

332
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,199
so we reached upon that we were starting

333
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,880
studying this specific aspect of botnets

334
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,920
the mobile dimension which was emerging

335
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,120
and we thought yes let's try to uh

336
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,880
shake up a little bit the community and

337
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,240
and work together

338
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,040
in order to find some elements which

339
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,880
will be helpful for everybody

340
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,199
so the objective was to collect uh

341
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,320
categorize and

342
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,519
and uh amass

343
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,800
as mund as sorry just collect as much as

344
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,760
possible

345
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,959
um mobile botnet malware

346
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,360
but so we didn't want to do it ourselves

347
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,480
be alone

348
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,360
because who we are to do this i mean we

349
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,120
will have access to some

350
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,639
and we thought that maybe if we have a

351
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,600
participatory crowdsource a collective

352
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,000
approach

353
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,760
to this it will optimize the results

354
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,240
and and the elements we can collect so

355
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,959
what we

356
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,079
thought that let's invite all the

357
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,160
participants of botkov to participate to

358
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,519
this collection

359
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,720
and we put together what we found and

360
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,519
then we redistribute this to these

361
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,920
participants

362
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,560
okay the expected results are quite

363
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,480
straightforward

364
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,440
the id and the objective and this is one

365
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,120
of the mandates of the commission

366
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,519
and in particular the research center is

367
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,480
to uh

368
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,320
support the research community to

369
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,079
federate this research community to

370
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:08,880
provide

371
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,560
some additional tool which will

372
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,680
facilitate and foster the research

373
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,240
so this is the first one and the second

374
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,639
one is also to consolidate a community

375
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,480
which will be maybe more focused a

376
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,399
little bit more focus on this aspect

377
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,519
of botnet they are and you are clear

378
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,000
evidence

379
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,800
of that that there is already a a quite

380
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,560
solid community on botnet but

381
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,120
maybe there is an additional uh effort

382
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,839
to be done

383
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,320
on on this mobile dimension which is

384
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,360
obviously a

385
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,560
very powerful and and growing trends

386
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,800
as it was demonstrated so far okay so

387
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,600
yes very briefly what we have done we

388
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,519
have as i said spam you you receive an

389
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,040
invitation to participate

390
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,079
we collected from uh from from

391
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,519
you uh we received uh some

392
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,959
sample uh you have used the the public

393
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,639
key of the gnc to

394
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,000
encrypt whatever you have sent us

395
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,040
and um uh

396
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,959
one of the tasks we still didn't finish

397
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,199
is to compile a report in order to

398
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,639
provide you another view of uh this uh

399
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,639
collection what you will find in this

400
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,720
collection

401
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,440
and then uh we would like to give it to

402
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,240
back to you

403
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,440
and we have invited you to send us

404
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,959
your public key and we receive

405
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,800
five so uh i don't want to speculate on

406
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,360
that

407
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,240
uh the the first reason maybe you are

408
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,360
not interested

409
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,639
uh the second reason which is for sure

410
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,360
the the

411
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,839
the most relevant one is that we were

412
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,600
not clear enough in our explanation

413
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,399
invitation

414
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,560
and you didn't get the point so there is

415
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,639
another opportunity

416
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,079
to do this we receive

417
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,279
some contribution uh from

418
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,839
uh three sources we have collected

419
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,400
520 mobile botnet malware

420
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,919
well i hope they are mobile botnet

421
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:10,640
malware

422
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,839
and not just mobile malware this is an

423
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,720
open discussion by the way

424
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,919
so this 520 sample

425
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,160
are at your disposal you just have to

426
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,039
send the key

427
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,799
by the way for those who already send

428
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,400
the key

429
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,679
we have a usb key

430
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,120
on which we have store your

431
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,160
unique own version so you can

432
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,840
pass by after the well during the break

433
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,440
to apostolos it has this five keys

434
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,480
for the others if you send us

435
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,840
your key already know maybe during the

436
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,880
afternoon we

437
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,679
can already encrypt and provide some of

438
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,480
you this key

439
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,200
otherwise we will send it to you by

440
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,320
regular mail

441
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,120
or other means really the objective of

442
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,400
today and

443
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,520
of the last 20 minutes is to get

444
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,760
feedback from you we would like to know

445
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,200
if it's relevant

446
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,960
if it will be useful for you

447
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,799
the format it has to be

448
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,280
designed in order to be more efficient

449
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,240
for you

450
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,760
uh the way we can have a sustainable

451
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,799
collection uh this is the snapshot

452
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,840
for this conference but we have in mind

453
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,799
to to have

454
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,640
and to maintain this collection and to

455
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,320
to improve this collection over

456
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,360
over the next months over the years

457
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,600
and yes your suggestion about

458
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,960
what would be the best way to distribute

459
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,039
this are more than welcome

460
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,720
instead of usb key of course

461
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,360
as it was on the lines previously by

462
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,640
some of the

463
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,679
speakers uh trust is super important

464
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,160
we have to put in place a minimum of

465
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,880
let's say

466
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,799
check uh uh at the end this is malware

467
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,160
so uh yeah i'm sure all of you

468
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,200
you are good guys uh but

469
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,320
yeah that's that's that's an open

470
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,280
question so

471
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,760
again uh what i'm expecting from you

472
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,320
right now

473

cocktail

481
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,120
but um yes but but for

482

to help

485
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,440
we really want to participate to this uh

486
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,360
in addition or for a big platform in

487
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,280
addition of our

488
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,559
own uh research on that in order to

489
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,679
strengthen this

490
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,120
research community so the floor is yours

491
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,439
thank you

492
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,200
[Applause]

493
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,120
so reactions feedbacks questions

494
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,919
not necessarily questions huh just

495
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,000
something you would like to have

496
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,679
christmas is not so far away so

give us your lists

498
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,919
again please send us your public key if

499
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:24,640
you are

500
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,440
interested by this by this first

501
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,240
collection

502
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,520
and we will send it to you as as fast as

503
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,559
possible

504
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,600
even during this one and a half day

505
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,799
no question yes

506
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,440
is it is it only open to european

507
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,159
citizens

508
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,440
or anyone um your question is related to

509
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,280
what's the job opportunity no

510
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,000
the the the collection okay uh because

511
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,520
for the job opportunity unfortunately

512
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,200
yes only european citizen

513
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,640
uh really unfortunate but it's like that

514
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,520
the collection no to all the research

515
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,080
community

516
