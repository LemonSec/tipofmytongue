1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,810
okay so for this first short talk we're

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,160
going to have an X and an X from

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,420
checkpoint so which one is Alex well

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,859
actually you have the pictures on the

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,090
screen so Alexander Charlie Charlie

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,150
Charlie Tico and Alexander Trofim Chuck

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,670
right from check to pronounce

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,289
how to pronounce but sorry about that

9
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:35,670
they seem very nice actually so you have

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,960
the floor thank you

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,520
Thanks hello so first of all I'm very

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,930
pleased to present a such a great crowd

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,629
here at BOTS conf and let me introduce

14
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,170
ourselves my name is dr. lukovitch Koh

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,260
and I'm a team leader for malware

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,660
reverse engineering team at checkpoint

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,820
and this is my colleague Alexander

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,219
traffic choke works at the Melbourne

19
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,829
researcher in my team so today I will be

20
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,159
talking about J clustering and analysis

21
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,659
mastering modern and involving threats

22
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,390
and in context of the system that we've

23
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,640
developed over the last couple of month

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,820
called DJ lab and then my colleague will

25
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,610
present live demo to you so let's move

26
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,500
on to the presentation DJ I bet you've

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,049
heard it a million of times already and

28
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:26,400
nevertheless let's discuss briefly

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,220
what's DJs the J stands for domain

30
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,130
generation algorithm and this algorithm

31
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,049
periodically generates a large number of

32
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,030
domain names which are known to the

33
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,670
malware author the malware to then

34
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,470
pretty rates a tiny number of those

35
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,570
domains before the start of the campaign

36
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,759
Melbourne client machines starts it

37
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,500
attempts to connect to the C&C server

38
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,149
from checking for internet connection

39
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,299
and if it's successful it then it rates

40
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,100
over the malicious domains until it

41
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,689
finds one that resolves to an actual IP

42
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,090
address and it's accessible at the

43
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:00,900
moment

44
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,600
and this kind of attack as it was

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,250
already said is hard to preemptively

46
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,330
block so let's define the problems while

47
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,240
fighting DJ malware we didn't on which

48
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,980
domains will be registered by attacker

49
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,290
and there are too many domains that will

50
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,330
be registered every day

51
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,870
so and only a small number of them will

52
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,540
actually be contacted by the malware

53
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,700
therefore it not feasible to register

54
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,340
and block them all making sinkhole not

55
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,920
effective in its current form and this

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,720
entire process can be automated

57
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,420
because including involves some kind of

58
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,670
cooperation fro from law enforcement

59
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,010
agencies such as Liverpool for example

60
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,930
so that's why we've developed our system

61
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,710
called DJ lab overall the system greatly

62
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,170
helps us to categorize and preemptively

63
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,660
block DJ enabled my Reb malware very

64
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,720
efficiently so that's why we want to

65
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,120
share this idea with you let's talk

66
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,540
about it in more details which support

67
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,570
for different types of DJ the first one

68
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,410
is a simplest type called static DJ

69
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,150
static DJ is type of DJ when the

70
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,730
generated up who's not dependent on data

71
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,600
or seed and it's most likely the kind of

72
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,610
detail that will generate the same

73
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,040
demands every time so it's simple to

74
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,500
implement the algorithm and grab the

75
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,920
output and block traffic according to

76
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,620
that the second type of DJ is database

77
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,980
DJ so the current date is used as input

78
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,870
for the algorithm to generate domains

79
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,930
and it's usually a very big and we can

80
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,170
reverse engineer this executable once we

81
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,030
implement the algorithm and pre generate

82
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,540
all future domains the third type is

83
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,140
seed based DJ this type of DJ authorizes

84
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,420
hard-coded seed as input for the

85
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,790
algorithm that's it is usually a very

86
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,450
big number and which can be predicted or

87
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,160
is it extracted from the executable

88
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,880
without

89
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,819
reverse engineering

90
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:10,310
in addition adversaries can change the

91
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,500
seats between the different executables

92
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,599
while they're using the polymorphic

93
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,358
creatures and also between the different

94
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,850
campaigns so simply we're implementing

95
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,590
this algorithm will not help you get all

96
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,300
the domains from different executables

97
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,330
and the most annoying DJ is a

98
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,610
combination of database DJ and seat base

99
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,150
DJ so we need a special type of virtual

100
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,510
machines to deal with it let's take a

101
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,750
look at the main features of DJ lab we

102
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,160
have designed two GL app to be able to

103
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,830
operate successfully with all types of

104
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,010
DJ to do so we created a separate model

105
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,210
for each family type and the system

106
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,070
itself can be easily extended to support

107
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,330
even new threat types when they arise

108
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,860
while many other we generate only a

109
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,320
partial list of domains we generate the

110
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,720
fullest almost every time this means an

111
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,470
extremely high and early detection rate

112
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,850
the GL app has an ability to combine

113
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,010
multiple sim similar DJ's into one

114
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,180
category and also as we're trying to

115
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,710
generate the full list of domains we

116
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,780
passed the traffic through our readiness

117
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,450
server and afterwards the malicious

118
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,600
traffic never leaves our environment so

119
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,900
the more guys have no clue that we are

120
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,660
used to getting them and however we can

121
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,850
whitelist any domain to be accessed by

122
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,330
the malware and return a real page to it

123
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,250
this is necessary as other malware is

124
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,800
checking for internet connection and

125
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,310
will just stop the emulation if they

126
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,870
detect no connection and so generate a

127
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,770
zero domains after all and also we don't

128
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,690
need a lot of resources to process large

129
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,360
amounts of samples daily as every

130
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,220
accumulation time is approximately like

131
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,590
three minutes and restoring the virtual

132
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,630
machine to initial state is almost

133
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,669
instantaneous due to the use of RAM

134
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:10,000
drives

135
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,940
well to collect and provide a lot of

136
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,890
statistics such as families categories

137
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,590
inside am detection rates samples

138
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,990
prevalence and the most active periods

139
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,600
and a lot more and this information is

140
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,210
highly useful for intelligence needs and

141
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,210
is represented in a friendly manner on

142
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:32,220
our web interface once we got generated

143
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,200
domains for a category authors domains

144
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,480
that generated the same domains even

145
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,490
those who detected by Ivy ancient for

146
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,520
example zero-day malware will be

147
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,110
assigned to that category as well and

148
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,080
detected based on the on these domains

149
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,710
and most vendors can look contain only

150
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,990
into the past while we can regenerate

151
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,150
the mines for the future so this is

152
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,320
shipped using a specifically designed

153
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,050
custom virtual machines this picture

154
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,570
gives us an advantage of generating

155
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,700
domains and disability block spreads for

156
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,360
patient zero computers so what's on

157
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,690
really hood with lamented new features

158
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,020
and factors a lot of cocoa sandbox and

159
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,060
kokum on code to deal with the main

160
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,560
problem of emulation detection of

161
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,160
virtualized environments so Wells

162
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,650
increased the built in by fixing a lot

163
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,920
of critical bugs also from the beginning

164
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,670
we noted that

165
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,380
VirtualBox which is used in conjunction

166
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,880
with cuckoo doesn't meet our

167
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,310
requirements so after a lot of testing

168
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,090
we've decided to use VMware Workstation

169
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:40,470
instead DJ lab doesn't use any product

170
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,780
out of the box so we implemented a lot

171
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,670
of fixes and adjustments and refractor a

172
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,520
lot of codes to achieve our goals so

173
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,830
this includes fixes to cocoa could come

174
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,800
on DL NetBIOS and tcp/ip stack on

175
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,600
windows that we use inside our virtual

176
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,240
machines also right in our own kernel

177
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,150
mode driver and also we developed this

178
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,710
kernel mode driver to handle problems

179
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,690
problems with detection of racialized

180
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,770
environments and other fixes this helps

181
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,140
us to increase our successful emulation

182
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,160
rate by 40%

183
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,240
so let's define our categorization

184
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,919
system of the malware within all samples

185
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,009
that with a pre assigned family that

186
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:27,990
we've got from our samples feed provider

187
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,479
and then we malade those samples using

188
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,899
their numbers VMs we take the results

189
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,589
and categorize them using a unique name

190
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:45,839
for each category so we can also

191
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,899
reassign samples family after simulation

192
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,800
stage let's imagine the situation when

193
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,079
we received a sample that feed provider

194
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:58,350
marked as simi family

195
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,750
so after simulation we recognized that

196
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,430
the generated demands actually belonged

197
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,940
to timba family the DJ library assigns

198
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,890
the samples from cyma family to the

199
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,959
timbo family automatically based on the

200
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:17,820
domains so let's take a look at the

201
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,940
detail app of role statistics at the

202
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,980
moment we support more than 28

203
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,430
distinctive families also DJ lab has

204
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,470
already pretest more than 100,000

205
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,820
samples 500 plus categories have been

206
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,720
discovered and we collected more than

207
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,339
700,000 unique malicious domains divided

208
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,170
by categories during the digital i/o

209
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,310
operation so let's take a look a

210
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,470
specific family for example well-known

211
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,820
timba we've got more than 68,000 total

212
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,420
samples processed just for timba 120

213
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,450
unique categories were detected and more

214
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,399
than 100,000 unique domains collected

215
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,610
for this family

216
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,190
here is the statistics by category 14

217
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,020
Val we can see that the most prevalent

218
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,600
categories here and this is really

219
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,270
useful for intelligent guys so they can

220
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,120
see which category is prevalent in the

221
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,450
moment

222
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,670
and let's sum up what cattle domains

223
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,350
even from samples that fail to get on

224
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,690
other popular platforms such as ferrous

225
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,030
towel malware and you're due to our

226
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:31,330
fixes the gel app is able to

227
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,190
automatically feed gather data to threat

228
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,130
intelligence databases which if done

229
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,030
almost there a false positive rate

230
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,230
detail app features lightning-fast

231
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,630
categorization even often animal we're

232
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,260
using that generated domains and we're

233
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,510
pretty efficient so emulation of one

234
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,370
sample takes approximately three minutes

235
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,660
and now I will pass you over to acts and

236
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,100
rhythm check for a live demo of our

237
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,060
system web interface now thank you will

238
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,079
sleep switch laptops

239
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,210
so please

240
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,910
now I will demonstrate our the gel app

241
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,300
system web interface each family has its

242
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,410
own DJ source implemented in Python

243
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,270
families are grouped by the first letter

244
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,180
in alphabetical order the static

245
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,460
families are displayed in black and

246
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,290
simulate the type families are displayed

247
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,680
in blue and water type families has its

248
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,540
own tooltip over the basic identifying

249
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,450
information the family type number of

250
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,870
categories total number of samples

251
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,340
percentage of family samples in the

252
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,190
jlabbe total number of domains of this

253
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:22,920
family and family creation date let's

254
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,380
look at static they'd based family for

255
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,100
example configure scene we have the

256
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,540
following information displayed on this

257
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,650
page the family name family type number

258
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,080
of domains per day till this list

259
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,660
possible domain links by the algorithm

260
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,870
and brief family description the dinners

261
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,970
list for five days is displayed at the

262
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,810
bottom of the page

263
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,110
each DNS list can be cropped out to two

264
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,300
thousand the main stop demise a preview

265
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,680
of this page but Holderness list can be

266
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,120
exported to use an export data button so

267
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,610
let's look at the static non date based

268
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,370
family for example sheets we have

269
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,020
similar information displayed on this

270
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,780
page but there is only one genus list

271
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,560
so let's take a look at a Malaysian time

272
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,920
family for example Simba the family

273
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,740
statistics displayed at lap top corner

274
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,480
of the page and contain the following

275
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,270
information total number of samples

276
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,760
number of samples process it skipped

277
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,130
with category and without category and

278
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,150
percentage of samples with category a

279
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,290
simple graph to the right of the

280
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,260
statistics box displays the number of

281
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,920
samples with category in blue and the

282
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,400
number of total samples in grape per day

283
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,020
for the last 60 days we can see how many

284
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,180
samples were analyzed and how many of

285
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,829
them have been assigned to a category

286
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,870
the list of categories displayed at the

287
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,900
bottom of the page and displays the

288
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,750
number of categories in the header

289
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,980
each category has the following

290
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,770
information the category name first the

291
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:20,520
main JD list number of domains number of

292
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,970
samples and date last seen the last in

293
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,089
one field shows us last time we saw a

294
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:31,230
sample for this category we use this

295
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:37,280
data we can recognize active categories

296
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,530
let's take a look at some category

297
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,250
details a category details a displayed

298
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,040
at the top of the page and contain a

299
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,500
category name family name first domain

300
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,420
LG list category creation time and time

301
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,110
last sample was added to the category

302
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,360
the references list is displayed below

303
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,730
the category details and there are

304
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,320
sha-256 of samples which belong to this

305
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,270
category the domains list is located at

306
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:19,200
the bottom of the page each domain the

307
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,640
main site displayed in the original

308
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,680
order of appearance let's take a look at

309
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,890
some analyzers report the file details

310
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,870
under analyze details

311
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,300
displayed at the top of the page the

312
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,510
next list is displayed at the bottom of

313
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:42,830
the page let's take a look at timber

314
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,170
category statistics the first diagram

315
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,750
displays the top 25 categories by the

316
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,110
number of samples in each category you

317
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,120
can easily see which category is most

318
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,120
prevalent we can assume that each

319
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,340
category can belong to a different trait

320
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:05,670
actor the family category statistics are

321
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,330
displayed below the diagram there are

322
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,150
this corresponding activity graph for

323
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,480
each category each graph is composed

324
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,780
using first scene sample dates obtained

325
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,090
from aristotle and grouped by the month

326
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:25,850
for a one full year this data shows us

327
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,340
categories activity and helps us see our

328
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,500
campaigns activity time range it's time

329
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,470
for scheduling statistics the categories

330
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,750
activity for the web 30 days is

331
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,450
displayed at the top of the page you can

332
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,670
just place the following types of events

333
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,880
creation of a new category and addition

334
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,050
of examples to a category we can update

335
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,180
the treat intelligence knowledge base

336
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,370
with a new category almost immediately

337
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:01,500
after it appears the Skloot activity for

338
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,510
the last 30 days is displayed at the

339
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,390
bottom of the page each one has the

340
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,079
following information date and time when

341
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,109
search Adam load task was started and

342
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:15,119
finished the family name and the number

343
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,440
of downloaded samples finally let's look

344
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,380
at the export page export page allows us

345
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,470
to export all the detail EPS data in

346
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:30,030
JSON format we can export all types of

347
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,720
families or emulated type families only

348
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,240
for the database DJ's we have option to

349
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,720
export domains for + - 45 days including

350
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,910
today or tax put domains

351
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,700
only for today

352
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,640
also we have option to select pretty

353
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,310
print if you want an easily easily

354
00:17:48,310 --> 00:18:03,240
readable JSON ad output thank you okay

355
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:09,040
we have some time for questions John

356
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,540
you're smiling you have a question no

357
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,070
thanks guys there was interesting um one

358
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,640
question there are also I believe DJs to

359
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,520
do some kind of unpredictable value of

360
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,270
the future say the euro dollar exchange

361
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:39,250
rate at midnight I can hardly hear yet

362
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,320
okay so there are I believe there are

363
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,170
DJ's that use that cannot be predicted

364
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,720
because they use an unknown value of the

365
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,240
future yeah so you some kind of seed

366
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,770
seed well nobody see for example a DJ

367
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,710
that you just say that looks up some

368
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,450
data on the internet that can't be

369
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,750
predicted okay on the white list it like

370
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,610
server like for example Twitter or

371
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,290
sounds like that yeah so it gets this

372
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,230
yeah I'm there and yes yeah if you look

373
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,890
at that or we can we sure can take care

374
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,470
of that kind of situation because we

375
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:19,620
have like white list of domains from Lex

376
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,740
first 1 million and we can access the

377
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,130
mobile can access whitelisted costs so

378
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:31,030
it can get that data that it needs to to

379
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,520
produce domains so we even if it's on

380
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,440
the third-party servers okay thanks

381
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,150
there state your name

382
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:47,259
whoa aha check thank you guys bye Seba

383
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:51,969
and the question is how do you integrate

384
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:55,519
digital up results or detail up into

385
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,499
checkpoint products actually we're

386
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,029
working on that integration right now

387
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:08,689
and we have a product it's using some

388
00:20:08,689 --> 00:20:10,849
kind of rather than intelligence

389
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:14,329
database on our gateways and it inspects

390
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:18,979
the traffic on the network level and so

391
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:21,409
we feed our database to that solution

392
00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:23,449
and it's inspected traffic and if it's

393
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:26,479
sees any of those domains it just plugs

394
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:28,429
a clog this communication and raises an

395
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:31,099
alert or any other action that is

396
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,409
selected by administrator

397
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:36,289
okay see he's a checkpoint firewall now

398
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:37,219
it's not a product

399
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:44,929
yeah it's okay okay thanks there was

400
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:48,709
another question yeah hi Jonathan from

401
00:20:48,709 --> 00:20:50,389
Fox I see so you guys basically take

402
00:20:50,389 --> 00:20:52,459
samples you classify them based on the

403
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,529
main characteristics so like domains too

404
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:56,119
similar and that's how you make groups

405
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:01,429
right basically inside the the different

406
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:03,259
families for example you'll take the one

407
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:06,589
family for example timba and you have a

408
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:11,029
different seeds of each sample that is

409
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:14,869
hard-coded in each sample and this will

410
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:17,599
generate the different domains for

411
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:21,139
different type of samples so we take the

412
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:27,249
output of the sample and we categorize

413
00:21:27,249 --> 00:21:30,369
this by domains that were regenerated

414
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:34,959
basically we have for example 1000

415
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:40,069
hundred samples and only 120 categories

416
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:41,959
inside am a distinctive categories

417
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,689
because out of this large number of

418
00:21:44,689 --> 00:21:47,649
samples we have

419
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:50,509
only 120 distinctive categories that

420
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,970
generate the same domains so each of the

421
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,669
category generates the same list of the

422
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:57,440
domains so it's limited number of

423
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,289
categories okay yeah because I was

424
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:01,190
wondering if you also do some

425
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,899
classifications beforehand so if you

426
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:04,940
know samples are related already you can

427
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,259
already classify them in certain groups

428
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:09,739
without checking DJ patterns basically

429
00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:17,179
we're doing like also say je twenty four

430
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:22,190
hundred and fifty six skipping procedure

431
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,309
so we don't process the same samples

432
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:27,769
twice but with we don't recognize them

433
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:33,440
based on some other on some other things

434
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,479
other than the mains actually so we

435
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,739
regenerate domains

436
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:39,470
look at these domains and if there is

437
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,419
the same we're putting anything in the

438
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:46,669
same category alright last question here

439
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:52,519
I don't think it's on there we go first

440
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:54,529
of all you said that you have the

441
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:57,259
ability to export the stuff that you

442
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:59,659
detect to other site intelligent systems

443
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:02,269
yes right is that something that is

444
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:04,190
accessible to anyone or do we have to do

445
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,580
that by request actually a checkpoint we

446
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,429
have like a lot of open source projects

447
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:14,330
lately like cocoa droid like the plugin

448
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:17,470
that were developed by our system called

449
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,679
labels for either for reverse engineers

450
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:24,889
so which share a lot of data but this

451
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:27,499
project is actually like for internal

452
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:29,330
use only because it's like a competitive

453
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,820
advantage for us so we're sharing the

454
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,950
idea of it but we're not sharing that at

455
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,899
the basis actually oh so you don't have

456
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:37,759
any kind of feed or anything that you

457
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,249
can share with other people wait we're

458
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:42,679
just don't have it at the moment maybe

459
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:45,499
later but at the moment we don't have

460
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:46,190
any

461
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,650
okay and if I have another minute each

462
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,080
wanted to get a clarification so if you

463
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,440
get a malware sample can you immediately

464
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,170
derive what kind of algorithm is used to

465
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,690
generate these domains don't you have to

466
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,050
like run a sample multiple times

467
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,220
different dates and different times just

468
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,670
to determine if it's time based seed or

469
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:10,730
a different kind of okay for example the

470
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:13,820
right it's kind of one cancer because if

471
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,790
it's just a date based malware we have

472
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,490
like we're implementing the algorithm

473
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,170
using the reverse engineering first of

474
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,420
all so we're implementing this algorithm

475
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,680
in our system so we don't need to run

476
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,290
the sample every time we're just testing

477
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,420
if it's did based malware first of all

478
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,790
so we're running the malware first of

479
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,110
all with a one date then there is

480
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,760
another date if if the outputs are

481
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,890
different then it's probably the date

482
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,300
based malware and we are first

483
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,950
investigating that and reverse

484
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,370
engineering it and so you do not just

485
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,640
dynamic analysis is what you also do

486
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,100
yeah for the cases that we need but it's

487
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,530
only need to be done only once and this

488
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,870
is advantage basically and this is all

489
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,400
the information within one system and

490
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,940
the more the more hardrick harder case

491
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,430
is when you have like a date based and

492
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,220
also acid based see it is like a random

493
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,410
number for example and then we need a

494
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,970
special type of virtual machine as I

495
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,570
mentioned so it will adjust the date and

496
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,010
we preach any rate the mains for the

497
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,230
future for example for a future for 45

498
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,780
days and we then we fitted to the thread

499
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,220
and revisions that you do that using

500
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:25,430
cuckoo Mon my modified DLL it's now

501
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,220
basically not as I said it's like we're

502
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,530
factored a lot of code it's no more it's

503
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,540
like not a cuckoo anymore but

504
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,790
it's done using the different technique

505
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,799
and the fake DNS servers and everything

506
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,169
else so we're using the another approach

507
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:45,640
with that but we can do even with this

508
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,809
kind of DJ type we can do good stuff so

509
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:52,000
I think well thanks

510
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,340
thank you okay thank you very much

511
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,850
thanks
