1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:03,720
so the last presentation of today before

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,309
the lightning talks yell you on

3
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:09,929
automatic classification through

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,349
register messages you have the floor

5
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:17,730
thank you Mark hello hello everyone my

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,000
name is yellow I come from the network

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,070
security research lab oh ji-ho 360 and

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:30,830
my talk is about my work classification

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:36,210
this is the outline firstly I will take

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,460
some time on polymorphic mayors and

11
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,370
current classification technologies

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,500
secondary I will talk about CNSE

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,760
protocol based classification solder a i

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,710
will show you our solution including the

15
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,020
definition of register message and the

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,870
solution details next use elements and

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,799
evaluation without then i will show you

18
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,920
some pitfalls that existing our solution

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,770
the final part is our conclusion as you

20
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,770
know a great many of new samples are

21
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,200
captured every day this figure user

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,409
portal from our quad one internet

23
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,450
security report I would like to notice

24
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,470
that as the unity is 10,000 our studies

25
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,140
show that most of the new samples are

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,479
just polymorphic variants of no mirrors

27
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,229
they are created by the technologies of

28
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:50,899
packing or color box occasion may well

29
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:54,680
classification user technologies that

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,750
classify a large number of samples into

31
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,600
a relative number of families that

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,740
simplifies the malware analysis and

33
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,500
detection problem a current

34
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,919
classification uses mainly been based on

35
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,120
sir static example

36
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,440
signatures such as the size students or

37
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,349
binary code snippets it has false

38
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,319
positive and false negative issues when

39
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:26,610
dinner is modern polymorphic malware

40
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,110
because the database updated speed may

41
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,540
not catch up with my we're growing

42
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,790
speech as you know Muslim modern

43
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,040
warriors are distributed to build

44
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,370
rapport net they can be used to make

45
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,660
money by a raunchy DDoS attacks or

46
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,239
spamming or clip flora or other verses

47
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,730
it's proved that is proved effective

48
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,569
that classif classifying botnets or mail

49
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:06,640
as best owns their cnc protocols such a

50
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,239
classification is Mary based on sir

51
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,609
protocol message' types formats or

52
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:16,420
interactions this means you need to know

53
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,260
the detailed protocol specification in

54
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,410
most cases you have to manually worse

55
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,019
but manually was the samples together

56
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:30,310
the detailed protocol specification this

57
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,620
causes a scalability issue without

58
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,690
talking about hours routine I would like

59
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,290
to show you our definition about that

60
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,260
register message it is the first message

61
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,949
you can change it up to a C and the SI

62
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:51,220
session is established either and it

63
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,370
must be sent by the bot sometimes it's

64
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,930
also called or login hello Orko home its

65
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,019
messages through teller controller the

66
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:04,810
bods machine configuration such as

67
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,900
operating system version cpu information

68
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,959
memory size or near speed it can also be

69
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,019
used to report her cody hard coded

70
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:16,570
information copy from sample for the

71
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,159
bottom ass to checking the bottle budget

72
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:23,260
many know botnets use this message in

73
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,950
their protocol here some examples

74
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,610
the first column is hot damn they are

75
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,220
taxi oh I Oakland no sir exit EDS

76
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,060
Chinese a meaty and tough lo some run on

77
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,270
windows some run on Linux assembler a

78
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,740
few run across both platforms as you can

79
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,130
see all the other registers include the

80
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,950
operating system and cpu information is

81
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,070
a register messages except except for

82
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,230
excel at the US and total sorry maybe or

83
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,790
including memory information is a

84
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,980
register marriage this is a detailed

85
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,890
register technician for elk not this

86
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,700
part is also called bill gates the right

87
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,980
thing is a see languages style structure

88
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,970
as you can see this this spots register

89
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,110
messages in has a panel format and have

90
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,660
a symmetrical strings inside ok this is

91
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,630
a this is a registered definition for

92
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,600
the top row family this body is also

93
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,690
called missed black in most cases it has

94
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,170
this text format as demonstrated by the

95
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:45,970
following examples there is a ton in

96
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,750
information theory color channel entropy

97
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,120
the week says entropy is a measure

98
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,780
mental unpredictability of information

99
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,990
content its value is calculated by this

100
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,040
formula and Shannon entropy can be used

101
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,370
to measure how statistically similar to

102
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,410
messages are when use the universal

103
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,250
messages a small case X I stands for the

104
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,640
unique message apart here are some

105
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,400
example stands if making about register

106
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,090
messages the first column is bottom they

107
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,140
r kelly hosts xrd ismaili and the elk

108
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,070
not except for the last one they have

109
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,910
all have fixed lens value and different

110
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,050
family will have different entry ranges

111
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,180
part of the value is very close inside

112
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:40,729
as

113
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:44,900
family and you can see there is so much

114
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,599
information including you register

115
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:49,999
message that we propose a new

116
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:53,809
classification that is based on similar

117
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:56,270
religious marriages to use the district

118
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:02,199
and structure we think our solution is

119
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,999
extended CNST protocol based

120
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:07,999
classification but recently it's more

121
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:10,610
scalable because the register message is

122
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,099
more easy to cater there's a whole

123
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,960
protocol specification this is our

124
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,490
objectives our objective is to classify

125
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,139
unlabeled samples based on the register

126
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:28,370
messages what we really do is to find

127
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,620
out the number of register meters and a

128
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,099
generator signatures for latest

129
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:37,099
identification we will not kill you

130
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:40,399
which cluster of registrar militias and

131
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,849
which are not this is left for decision

132
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:46,999
by by human and our system we were

133
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,370
larger Club classified HTT better

134
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,580
register because they have existed good

135
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,370
such as routine and as you know there is

136
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,580
so much classification classification

137
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,550
information in HTTP that we think it's

138
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,279
better to classify them you know

139
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:07,849
separated the solution this is our

140
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:12,649
solution architecture firstly the new

141
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:15,740
samples are running our sandbox the

142
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,930
network with network addresses are

143
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,629
served at the same time we also download

144
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:23,979
network test provides total ID ID

145
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:27,319
secondly the network chest I input to

146
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:31,879
the register file and after

147
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,149
deduplication and excluding including

148
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:39,349
HTT P Lucas the unique and registers are

149
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:42,789
divided into two large TCP and UDP

150
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,819
classes the result logic classes are

151
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:49,160
imported to a step back order cost

152
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,130
grandeur clustering this step used to

153
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,160
produced statistically similar clusters

154
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,210
and as a result smaller clusters I input

155
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:04,960
to a step codifying grindr clustering

156
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,590
this table produced structures similar

157
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,550
groups in the final step sweet have 0

158
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,780
signatures are generated and the

159
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,230
generates the signature will be used to

160
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,620
rescan all the input registry excluded

161
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,650
those cast a successful class classified

162
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,400
ones and the left registe will be input

163
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,920
for the next run to class three and a

164
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,890
sickly generation the adoration we are

165
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,580
not stop until there is no new

166
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,790
structurally similar groups are produced

167
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:47,099
although no new signatures are generated

168
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,760
register profiling basically it's a

169
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,090
process of passing pcap files and the

170
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:00,160
creations register structures at the

171
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,060
same time it also set up as such a

172
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,750
attributes for each register they are

173
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,750
lenz entry value binary or text format

174
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,430
and the somatic students here to sample

175
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,700
register files the left one has binary

176
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,230
format its lens is 260 it has low

177
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,520
entropy value of zero seven and it has

178
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,430
three symmetrical students the left the

179
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,380
right one is easy to understand for

180
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,140
consideration of time I will not explain

181
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:41,890
it in detail cuz grand clustering this

182
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,040
deputies is used to global statistical

183
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,390
register registers basically it's a step

184
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,070
a step our chemist clustering on vectors

185
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,850
of lens and entry we arrange this step

186
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,870
is just to reduces a complicating cost

187
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,570
because o n squares computation Cloud

188
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,160
City is needed if you attempt to

189
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,139
director find out the structure similar

190
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:14,600
registry currently you use a furious DVD

191
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,170
docking procedure to find out the

192
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,019
semantic experience the frequently

193
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:24,170
including of common semantic students

194
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,410
are concluded every samanga students

195
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,589
have zur has the following excuse they

196
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:36,110
are semantics offset and size alyssa is

197
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,720
commas at allen's fury is used in

198
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,360
message to indicate how many parts of

199
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,139
the message has we concluded the three

200
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:48,170
types of semantics the as shown in the

201
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,720
figure the first thing is lens value

202
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,959
equals two then three the first secondly

203
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:56,629
is a lens value goes lens 1 plus less to

204
00:11:56,629 --> 00:12:00,139
the study is lens value equals two lanes

205
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:03,379
1 plus lens through plasmas ray and the

206
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:05,000
lens fielder may have different of your

207
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,379
size country we consider three casts and

208
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:12,829
they it may be placed in different by

209
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:15,170
the order hosted by the order or

210
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:20,480
Netwalker biology stretch simile this

211
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,630
step is also called fine-grained

212
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,689
clustering it is used to find as a

213
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:29,360
structurally similar registered to

214
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,149
registers are considered structurally

215
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:35,480
similar Eve and a leaf they have similar

216
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,529
entry values and they share the same set

217
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:41,899
of somatic students and the zeppole they

218
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:44,509
are praising other and they share the

219
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:47,540
same format Elaine's field and they

220
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,930
share the same including formats and

221
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,199
they have similar lens value before

222
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:56,389
talking about sickness generation I

223
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:58,610
would like to show you to sample

224
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,180
signatures that our system produced the

225
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,730
name is machine-generated it is based on

226
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,079
the pattern summary and it created ham

227
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,339
the name is used for later

228
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:13,790
identification the ordinary users to

229
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,730
tell the inspector engine which messages

230
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,570
should be inspected for registered GG

231
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,620
is a value of zero to five and one

232
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,940
thousand it means as the register magic

233
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,760
is the first experts like changing the

234
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,020
message in the 0th or five round of cns

235
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,040
in taxi another lens values to college

236
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,980
Kelsey inspecting engine which lends the

237
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,930
register should have it is matched by it

238
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:52,610
by this row and the entry value used for

239
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,180
reference for inspecting and as a

240
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,240
pattern easy to easy to understand it

241
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,380
just used to tell the inspector engine

242
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,070
at which offset how many and watch

243
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:12,320
contended parts should exist signature

244
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,990
Asian a set of signatures are generated

245
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,210
for each group of structurally similar

246
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,690
registers the generation steps including

247
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,230
finding out a frequent items of offset

248
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,190
and byte value modern after the

249
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:32,150
continuing items of upset and byte value

250
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,730
and normalizing them into valid

251
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,570
signatures and we define some policy to

252
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,420
four-page signal generation the Ashley

253
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,360
the at least occurs me is how many

254
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,310
registers are needed to generate a valid

255
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:53,620

bites are valid signal should have and

258
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,010
as a at least continuous six signature

262
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,220
gross is a cast our classic dead mining

263
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:26,330
algorithm we use them to find the Fluke

264
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,000
in the items offset and ballot and by t

265

266
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,130
algorithm for flu

267
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,010

transaction take basis and as FP gross

270
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,240
our group solves the same problem

271
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,890
problem but has better performance and

272
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:51,590
country you use a priority and we will

273
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,200
soon update our system to Epicurus for

274
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,160
better performance sweet observe

275
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,620
signature to find the first is called

276
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,780
normal it's a just defines specific bite

277
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,630
patterns occurring at a specified offset

278
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,260
the secondary is called pcie it is

279
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,690
produced by replacing the symmetrical

280
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,930
patterns with equivalent pcie

281
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,970
expressions the soda is called entropy

282
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,610
if you use the wind no related patterns

283
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,820
could be generated and all the registers

284
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,520
have the same bless length and very

285
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:37,730
close and she values we have implemented

286
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,440
our idea in c++ and passion the our

287
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,160
solution contains about 2005 hundreds of

288
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,810
see lines of supply transcoder our tests

289
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,290
show that it takes more than less than

290
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,520
30 minutes to classify ten thousand or

291
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,740
ten thousand registered this test is

292
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,420
down on a machine have this

293
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,449
configuration and the early singles

294
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:10,670
ready program is used we also we also

295
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,209
did many tests on the to find a the best

296
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,780
choice choice of chem chem e k value for

297
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:23,290
cami's hours as you use figure the the

298
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,319
x-axis stand for k value and as a y-axis

299
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,490
than sense for the successfully class

300
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:35,660
classified number our test Josie 20

301
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,250
years the best choice for cami's

302
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,550
positive negative and false false false

303
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:46,480
positives we test our system will with

304
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,260
about five

305
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:53,480
family note registers the false past fun

306
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,580
activity is sweet up 91 % and as a false

307
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:06,950
positive 000 strips and we also do some

308
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,510
tests to see how many rounds are needed

309
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,930
our tests show that when cuz if

310
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:19,400
classifying less than 10,000 registers

311
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,780
for round is enough and as you can see

312
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,960
most most outrageous are successful

313
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,450
Christopher Dean's of what's wrong here

314
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:36,460
some signature that our system generated

315
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,770
the this signature or have logic

316
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,340
coverages the first t is for the class

317
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,890
classic has done this protocol is used

318
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:51,160
for natural travels we will rent

319
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,230
unlabeled assembles in our sandbox we

320
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:59,510
create many many correct many wedges of

321
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:04,070
this kind we have no idea whether it is

322
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,840
malicious or not and our system

323
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,890
generator silky for them the second

324
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,490
thing is for a kind of ssl client a

325
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:22,520
hello in fact we collected many many

326
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,730
kinds of ssl request they have different

327
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,070
version value and the substitute

328
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:34,640
combination the soda is for a pot named

329
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,900
blood bindi yes you can see this spot

330
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,650
has a text format register and we

331
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:47,240
currently have no idea what is what is

332
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,210
the malicious purposes ball has but you

333
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,430
should use that to this body is

334
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,060
malicious the last year's for the

335
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:00,740
notorious dds bottle night all this

336
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,850
bother has a band

337
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:07,030
format and its register message has has

338
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:11,110
operating system CPU information and

339
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,210
memory size and then nails no speeding

340
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:19,490
information of course there is no

341
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,039
perfect solution here are some pitfalls

342
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:26,870
we think exists in our system the first

343
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:31,220
thing is not open net use register C&C

344
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,610
protic there certainly is for UDP bed

345
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,580
cnc protocol it's hard to tell which

346
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,770
messages register and which is not

347
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,919
because of issues Daedalus nature the

348
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:45,140
study is the same register may be shared

349
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,620
across different cnc protocols for the

350
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,309
walk need to for the right

351
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:55,309
classification and the last is our

352
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:59,030
system is not good at class classifying

353
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,970
text format registers with non-fixed

354
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:08,510
mess the final years conclusion our

355
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,169
tells users statistical under structural

356
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:15,289
similarities among register can be used

357
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:18,230
to classify classify allegedly vacuole

358
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,039
and register based classification can

359
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:26,500
complement CNSE based classification and

360
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,780
our solution phones better when deer is

361
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,299
finally formats registers and text

362
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:37,400
format that's all any question if you

363
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,409
want to thank you

364
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,470
if you want to further discussion please

365
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,049
feel free to contact me by this email

366
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:51,830
odds my Twitter account okay thank you

367
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:59,270
well do you have questions oh there

368
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,490
thank you for the talk to execute the

369
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,440
the binary you actually have to defeat

370
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,440
all the ante foreign things and so on so

371
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,830
do you have any advice or any insights

372
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,629
on how to do that quickly and

373
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:24,070
efficiently I'm sorry to actually get

374
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,649
the Hajis Thomas H you have to get the

375
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:29,259
malware to one and that is difficult to

376
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:31,870
do because of all the deccan tomorrow

377
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,480
insects on our way yes yes of course

378
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,059
there are many male ways that did not

379
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:39,460
show the CNSC pretty heavy in aus and

380
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,990
pork is this is our future work okay yes

381
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:48,039
and did you get any result with just the

382
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:51,580
binary can you extract the register

383
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,309
message just looking at the code without

384
00:22:54,309 --> 00:23:00,240
executing the malware no okay Carly not

385
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:06,240
another question no more okay thank you

386
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,269
thank you
