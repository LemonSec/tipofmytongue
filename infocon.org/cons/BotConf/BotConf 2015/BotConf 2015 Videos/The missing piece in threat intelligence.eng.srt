1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,660
okay so next for this afternoon hongda

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:13,700
knee from not not so famous French ISP

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,330
and so not not only is it interesting

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,080
that someone from a big web hosting

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,869
company talks but the content of his

6
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:26,900
presentation is really interesting

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,949
you'll see that they're doing

8
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:34,559
interesting work at OVH on on the

9
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,620
subject of threat intelligence and I'm

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,660
really looking forward to listening to

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,319
you you want this Mike okay

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,600
all right good afternoon McCombs how's

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,590
it going so far good hello how's it

14
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,790
going so far that's better all right so

15
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,590
this is a talk about something which is

16
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,320
missing in threat intelligence as well

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,670
as a proposal to fix it so who's that

18
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,270
guy well my name is right nice i work at

19
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,750
OVH my job is to find bad stuff on the

20
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,649
edge network and I also do a bunch of

21
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:28,070
stuff if you're into crypto into big

22
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,950
data security feel free to check out my

23
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,640
github and Twitter accounts so if you've

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,360
never heard about OVH ovh is the largest

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,070
I spin you up we build and operate $17

26
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:47,270
centers more coming up soon we manage

27
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,240
quite a lot of domain names as well we

28
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,550
are the second ritual in Europe we

29
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,340
provide a bunch of services such as

30
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,119
entreprise telephony connectivity cloud

31
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,700
services dedicated servers this is main

32
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,350
thing we do VPS and maybe you know a

33
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,360
wedge under a different name because we

34
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,630
have quite a few resorts as well alright

35
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,320
so back to the topic what is sweet

36
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,480
intelligence well for some people it

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,890
just feeds RSS not so much but feeds

38
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,329
yeah why not well actually it's probably

39
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,130
more interesting if you give more

40
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,620
context if you try to understand what's

41
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,540
going on who where why how still for a

42
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,360
lot of people this is what really

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,090
matters just give me a bunch of

44
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,970
malicious IPS a bunch of many shoes

45
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,530
domain names and maybe just some

46
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,870
signatures or some words for my IDs or

47
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,829
my product why well why are we doing

48
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:58,489
that well the thing is we do all these

49
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:01,819
things just for defense we want to

50
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:04,700
prevent some bad stuff

51
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,520
from infecting network enterprise

52
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,660
network private networks toothbrushes

53
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,420
everything so really what matters is

54
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,319
this and when you can just use this list

55
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,930
of malicious IPS and domains to enforce

56
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:27,239
some rules all right so I join to the

57
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,489
edge just a couple months ago and I was

58
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:32,120
like all right cool where do I start now

59
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,930
well what I did is pretty obvious I just

60
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,030
retrieve the bunch of public and private

61
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,030
feeds of malicious IPS and I was looking

62
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,470
for matches on the ovh sonnets and in

63
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,170
order to do so i used combined so if you

64
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,849
never heard about combined this is a

65
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:52,650
great tool check it out it's on github

66
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,980
so basically combine retrieves a bunch

67
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,010
of feeds and then it's going to add some

68
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,780
extra information it's going to

69
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,459
normalize everything combined everything

70
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,959
and what you're gonna get is just a JSON

71
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,359
file in a CSV file that you can use very

72
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:11,790
easily so i just use combined weights

73
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,890
about 41 feeds and what i found is about

74
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,220
10 files on IPS on the OVH network was

75
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,000
like what that's quite a lot well the

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,520
thing is most of them were just scans

77
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,789
and some rosy Rose vendors blocking some

78
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:31,890
nets as soon as they see more than two

79
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,860
IPS having performance can so we had

80
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,220
holes / 24 being blocked which is pretty

81
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,120
bad so we already have a bunch of very

82
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,820
specific models to deal with spam and

83
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,190
scans and D dose so I really wanted to

84
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,780
focus on one sheet one thing which is my

85
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,330
way so I just filter out a bunch of

86
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,820
saying that I wasn't reinvested in and

87
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,750
what I found was a bit more of the 700

88
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,740
IPS in this list so I was like yeah

89
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,639
still a lots well now what should I do

90
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,910
if you ever seen one by one this is what

91
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,639
I did it's very painful stereos it's

92
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,659
long but this is what I did and I found

93
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:18,210
about 17 IPS for which I

94
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,130
evidence that there were malicious

95
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,080
having something right now or they used

96
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,150
to self something malicious not so long

97
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,090
ago hired some fingerprints that could

98
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,759
recognize so okay they could be nuked

99
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,400
right away which was great what about

100
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,740
everything else well for most of them I

101
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,039
couldn't find any evidence and you know

102
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,410
what when all you have is an IP address

103
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,120
and you're trying to get some

104
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,460
intelligence about it and all you see is

105
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,650
nothing or suspicious malicious well you

106
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,020
can look for the usual suspects if you

107
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,150
don't find anything as a nice p does

108
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,400
absolutely nothing I can do with this

109
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,039
IPS nothing I can do with most of the

110
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,990
feeds I don't have any contacts I don't

111
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,030
know what I'm looking for I'm not gonna

112
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,340
take down a customer account just

113
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,889
because some guy said hey I think it's

114
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:12,930
suspicious I don't know why maybe you

115
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,669
should block it or just take it down

116
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:18,270
nope I can do anything so that's a bit

117
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:23,430
annoying and I found a bunch of ips that

118
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,229
have been taken down sometimes a long

119
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:28,680
time ago and that just popped up and

120
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,840
it's interesting some feeds have some

121
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,960
slight delay like the hallways have 40

122
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,449
girls today so that they are blocking

123
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:38,159
something that happened the day before

124
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,940
which is sometimes not very effective

125
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,590
compromised servers so this is happening

126
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,900
a lot but sometimes people actually

127
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,659
reinstall the servers sometimes it's

128
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,960
probably clean but still there is IP

129
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,490
stay for a long time in most blacklist

130
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,380
IP is reassigned to completely different

131
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,330
customers still being blocked for a

132
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,210
while IP is that an never been a sign

133
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,419
maybe typos or just overall zeros people

134
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:11,039
blacklisting / 24 and some IPS that we

135
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,630
recently acquired from different

136
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,900
companies as well it's interesting false

137
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,659
positives especially for fishing so I'm

138
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:19,680
going to show a pretty interesting

139
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,229
example soon sinkholes so yeah if you

140
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:27,630
sell a security product should you rock

141
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,810
sinkholes well my take is that if you do

142
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,650
so

143
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,270
you're just being an with other

144
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,509
researchers from which you're probably

145
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:37,949
retrieving and monetizing intelligence

146
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:41,250
from so don't blog sinkholes the

147
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,620
sinkholes are not malicious Percy so

148
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,550
don't block sinkholes VPN tall proxies

149
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,470
well okay VPN Toro they're used a lot

150
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,639
but bad guys to dash perform scant in

151
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,150
look for which is a search passwords and

152
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,600
some common wordpress plugins that's

153
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,669
true but the thing is if you take down

154
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:09,060
at or exit none or VPN exit nod well

155
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,850
people just running scripts don't care

156
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,740
the scripts are going to be just

157
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,050
slightly slower but they don't really

158
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,910
care you're just going to hurt real

159
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,190
legitimate people who actually need to

160
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,560
so it's completely useless to take down

161
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,539
tor exit nodes Torah is still working

162
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,169
you're just going to take a different

163
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:32,309
path well still on a bunch of servers

164
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:34,620
running tour exit nodes we see some

165
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,419
different kind of badness so in this

166
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,820
case it makes sense to completely take

167
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,039
down the server but just because this is

168
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,620
a tour IP and you saw that in your idea

169
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,980
slugs it's not worth blocking CDN load

170
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,520
balancers and cloud services so what is

171
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,130
cloud services well basically you can

172
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,370
just rent an IP and server for a couple

173
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,980
minutes Harold's days wakes and then you

174
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,620
just dispose it so behind the single IP

175
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,880
you're going to have a lot of customers

176
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,589
completely unrelated customers so if you

177
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,240
choose to block something which cause

178
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,130
you saw some malicious activity coming

179
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,330
from an IP which is on a CDN or cloud

180
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,670
service it's not really useful you're

181
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,290
just blocking legitimate customers and

182
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,779
the real thing you were after it's

183
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:25,110
probably somewhere else so it just note

184
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,380
about OVH well this is a bunch of

185
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,410
interesting IPS that choose to be

186
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,770
blocked couple days ago and the thing is

187
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,970
all of this are actually CloudFlare so

188
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,750
sure this ipes we are probably observed

189
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,240
in ids logs

190
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,730
of some malicious activity but still

191
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,089
behind all of this IPS just a lot of

192
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:54,300
completely legitimate website and if you

193
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,610
watch one of these IPS maybe what you're

194
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,500
looking for is using something else and

195
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,200
especially cloudflare they use two

196
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,240
different IPS pro domain so if you blog

197
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,940
just one you're not going to do anything

198
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,850
you're just protein legitimate website

199
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,160
and that's it well the thing is

200
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,649
everybody knows about cloud player but

201
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:16,110
you will see the ends there are many of

202
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,910
them cloud services share

203
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,060
infrastructures that ton of them how can

204
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,850
you know how many people are behind a

205
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,760
single IP well you can't not easily

206
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,580
right this is an e-commerce website it's

207
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,010
called style they sell electronics the

208
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,370
great site completely legitimate and the

209
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,980
thing is today a bunch of security

210
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,630
products are going to like this as

211
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,580
malicious don't go there why how come

212
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,510
well as a nice p this is her reason

213
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,420
which is not enough but this is actually

214
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,320
why it's blood because on virustotal the

215
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,630
detection ratio is not 0 and some

216
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,250
products are just like okay it's 0 0

217
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,760
just a bunch of hits on VT so let's

218
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,140
block it so yeah in 2013 it used to be a

219
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,260
dog jumper of C&C dr. Perry said ddos

220
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,649
boat so yeah 12 quite a long time ago

221
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:19,560
right still if you don't pay attention

222
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,770
to the date and a lot of projects don't

223
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,260
let just look at the ratio this thing is

224
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,930
going to be blocked this is a choice

225
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,720
this is what I see we had a customer

226
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,550
from may 2013 to january2014 and yeah it

227
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,120
was a pretty suspicious guy and then

228
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,709
this specific IP was completely

229
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:43,950
unassigned for a while and october 15

230
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,500
2014 to an assign to a completely

231
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,089
different customer which is totally

232
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:51,149
legitimate as far as i know this is some

233
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,670
interesting information however nobody

234
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:57,620
has it except maybe isp

235
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,810
this is a different example this is a

236
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,520
mud this is a pretty cool game you can

237
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,850
play it using telnet or online with

238
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,840
flash or html5 is quite fun it's

239
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,320
legitimate but I thing is a bunch of

240
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,320
vendors I are blocking it why because

241
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,380
two years ago nuclear exploit kit where

242
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,930
seen on this IP and you know expect kids

243
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,910
tend to use a lot of different host

244
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,010
names and domain names and if you just

245
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,530
blocks please switch domain names it's

246
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,330
completely useless by the time you

247
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,890
actually block the domain name it's

248
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,930
already using something else so all you

249
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,240
can block is actually the name servers

250
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,900
sometimes or d IP but the thing is you

251
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,420
don't really know how long it's still

252
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,930
suspicious well you can take a look at

253
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,290
dns records but it's not enough and what

254
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,960
I saw is that actually this specific IP

255
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,360
Wes taken down the day after nuclear

256
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,360
Wells live on this IP completely

257
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,540
unassigned until January 2015 and then

258
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,880
we assign to somebody else so yeah the

259
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,370
problem is when you see something my

260
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,770
issues how long should you keep it

261
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,770
blocked how long is it malicious how to

262
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,350
tell if you don't see anything anymore

263
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,980
like okay I don't see any DNS names

264
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,660
mapping to this IP anymore what does it

265
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,780
mean it just means that you don't see

266
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,330
anything anymore maybe there's something

267
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,850
else going on you're just not aware of

268
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,550
it maybe there's nothing going on but

269
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,370
it's the same actor behind this IP and

270
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,740
it's going to do something else pretty

271
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,910
soon so you don't know also hint maybe

272
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:47,070
the ice P knows so what most people do

273
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,030
is assign some random TTL every time I

274
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,830
see something my shoes let's keep it for

275
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,520
three months well maybe it's not enough

276
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,510
made me steal malicious maybe it's too

277
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,490
much and you're preventing your own

278
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,680
employees from accessing legitimate

279
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,310
website they need to work so to tell if

280
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,040
you just assign some rhythm TTL

281
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,620
doesn't work very well oh and this is

282
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,190
usually the case for fishing you can

283
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,860
monitor all specific URLs and see if you

284
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,220
get 24 flow but I thing is when you know

285
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,089
about one specific fishing URL well

286
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:29,819
that's a ton of other URLs on the same

287
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:32,399
server so if you don't see one anymore

288
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,170
it wit on the 40 it does that mean that

289
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,089
there's not a live fish in campaign

290
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:37,829
which is still going on on the same

291
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:40,500
server and what we frickin to observe is

292
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,699
that on the same server you have

293
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,380
multiple campaigns running at the same

294
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,589
time so if you don't see one anymore you

295
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:48,600
can be sure that you're not missing

296
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,269
something forever that's a different

297
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:53,880
strategy some vendors are doing that or

298
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,880
until your customer complains and that's

299
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,250
actually pretty interesting because when

300
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,160
someone stumbles open something a

301
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,060
website or a file and the AV e says hey

302
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,209
its meshes well people usually don't

303
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:10,800
complain this is a frosting they do

304
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,220
nothing the second thing they do is the

305
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,019
guy complained to whoever wrote the

306
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,329
software or operate the website saying

307
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:22,620
hey you have thing is malicious well and

308
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,990
this person is probably not going to

309
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,100
care maybe is there going to tell the

310
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,160
ice P the ice P doesn't have time to get

311
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,410
in touch with AP founders and saturated

312
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,510
product vendors to tell a my customers

313
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,470
blah blah maybe it's not malicious now

314
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,829
and really getting in touch with the

315
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:45,930
situation under is the very last thing

316
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,149
people do if only because they might not

317
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:50,600
speak your language how often do you get

318
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,010
complaints about false positive from

319
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,130
people in China if you're a US company

320
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,779
well not so much because people might

321
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,189
not speak your language and they don't

322
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:00,860
even know how to get in touch with you

323
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,740
but I SP know a bit more they can get

324
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,399
some complain that you don't get but st.

325
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,420
still your security product verner you

326
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,209
get a request and thus a person saying

327
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:17,550
hey this is my website it used to be

328
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,670
compromised now it's clean I swear it's

329
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,459
clean trust me you're going to trust him

330
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:24,990
why

331
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,209
okay this is a big customer there's a

332
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:30,480
lot of traffic on this domain ok let's

333
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,240
whitelist it so it like rolling the dice

334
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,050
right but it's really tricky you need

335
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,630
more context you don't know if it's safe

336
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:46,110
anymore maybe the isp knows JSP can tell

337
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,120
you hey this machine was completely

338
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,790
reinstalled so it's more likely to be

339
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:56,300
clean now so if you get a sample today

340
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,490
or just a signature for it and you know

341
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,470
it's malicious it's obvious you run it

342
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,040
ok to banking treasure on it's malicious

343
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,660
if you come across the same signature in

344
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,050
a couple years well it's seen malicious

345
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,420
if you see that on your network well

346
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,160
some device has been compromised it's

347
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,550
obvious so it's always women but what

348
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,730
about IPS domain names even emails have

349
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,209
a cycle of life they can be measures for

350
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,319
a given time period and then Tory clean

351
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,660
so if you have this kind of indicators

352
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,540
is it really critical to have a time

353
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:39,120
window so this is a fishing web page we

354
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,740
got this report from a company doing a

355
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,550
great great job at spurring fishing

356
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:47,760
amazing job and we got this website and

357
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,580
there were like hey it's a fishing

358
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,970
alright so BNP paribas is a bank okay

359
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,090
you can see on the hostname there is BNP

360
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:01,559
all right it says login password ok it's

361
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,559
probably a fish right well if you happen

362
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,690
to be French not only to speak French

363
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,760
but to be French you may notice

364
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,700
something it says siiii which stands for

365
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,559
committed onshore breeze this is a

366
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,170
website by employees for employees to

367
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,700
discuss the company benefits so if you

368
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,690
happen to be French you're going to be

369
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:25,140
like huh let me double check so same

370
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,400
thing sometimes you come across

371
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,530
something like a domain name that looks

372
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,590
like your DGA you're not sure it's not

373
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,360
part of a cluster or but there's a lot

374
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,350
of digits it's weird maybe you

375
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,539
you can ask somebody who can speak

376
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:40,980
Mandarin and this person is going to

377
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,520
tell you hey it sounds like some very

378
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,400
common marine world and it's a way to

379
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,350
write this modern world using layton

380
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,410
character so maybe it's not a it's not

381
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,419
something malicious maybe it's a false

382
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,630
positive double check so who can help

383
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,470
you with that well maybe your local ISP

384
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,960
can help a franchise p can tell you hey

385
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,809
maybe this is legitimate because I

386
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:08,549
understand French into French culture

387
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,950
maybe a chinese isp can tell you this is

388
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:16,260
not a DGA and also I speech and talk to

389
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,570
their customers like you see a domain

390
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,710
name with a ton of host names what is it

391
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,330
well ain't no way you're going to ask

392
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,140
directly the website owner it's a bit

393
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:36,350
weird but the ice pecan nitrate the

394
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,809
indicator awesome compromise so let's

395
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:43,440
say you see see to today it's active

396
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,309
it's a 32 and then this c2 gets taken

397
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:51,090
down and a couple months later you see

398
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,429
some traffic on your network going to

399
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:56,730
this see to it seem weird maybe some of

400
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,799
your devices would compromise even if

401
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,630
the situation active anymore it's still

402
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:05,900
a sign that hmm something happened

403
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:09,480
something if you know that this specific

404
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,270
domain name is serving a payload like

405
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,190
you yet a droid x payload not a download

406
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,080
our but the payroll itself and after a

407
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,230
while this payload is not served anymore

408
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,750
but still you see some traffic going to

409
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,530
it that's real maybe still one of your

410
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:30,150
machine got infected so you should block

411
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,789
them ah unless it's get up or drop box

412
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:34,950
you're not going to block dropbox even

413
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,770
if dropbox is hosting a payload or gator

414
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:41,730
or something you know but what if it's

415
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,530
something in version that you don't

416
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,780
understand maybe i'm going to block it

417
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,179
well a better of thing to do would be

418
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:51,340
maybe to use different indicators

419
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,360
add specific URLs signatures patterns at

420
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,730
least port numbers something less

421
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:04,660
generic what about compromise website so

422
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,240
this is a story of a big website there's

423
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,370
a lot of people going to it it's total

424
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,640
energy teammate and it got compromised

425
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,690
so now just an iframe and no redirect to

426
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,000
an exploit kit well this is a story we

427
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,380
here pretty much every single week

428
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,500
that's pretty sad but still you're not

429
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,450
gonna blog like The Reader's Digest

430
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,710
forever they could compromise and then

431
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,590
presumably the safe but you don't know

432
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,790
exactly when still if you see traffic

433
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,760
going to this website after they've been

434
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,390
cleaned there's no reason to block them

435
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:46,330
compromise domains so this is a story

436
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,160
about a guy he has a lot of domain names

437
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,550
which is stirred at the Registrar let's

438
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:57,160
call it go Mimi and his coma me account

439
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,760
gets compromised and bad guys use the

440
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,610
glamour me API to reduce our host names

441
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,900
and their host names how used by

442
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,690
ex-pec-tates well after a while maybe

443
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,000
these guys can I realize oops I was

444
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,570
found I'm going to change my password

445
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,100
migrate to the front registrar and maybe

446
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,370
the domain name itself is totally safe

447
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,870
now there's no reason to blush it

448
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,190
anymore landing pages I'm going to

449
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,130
exploit kits sorry for that so a landing

450
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:33,550
page is usually using a lot of ephemeral

451
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,860
hostnames tons of first names everybody

452
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,570
gets a different one so that's cool and

453
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,310
you never go to these pages

454
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,730
intentionally we ate already right

455
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,980
malvert izing or compromised website you

456
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,860
never go to this web page directly by

457
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,260
yourself so after an IP having been

458
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,400
observed to serve an exploit exploit

459
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,400
kick landing page has been taken down

460
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,140
and then reassigned to something else

461
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,650
it's not malicious anymore what's going

462
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,110
on on this IP doesn't have anything to

463
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,880
you is what happened before and maybe

464
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,370
now there's a website that people go

465
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,970
intentionally but still it pretty spotty

466
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,950
tough to know when something needs safe

467
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,570
or not so maybe we should distinguish

468
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,450
two things lightweights you see

469
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,390
something the payload is hell I can

470
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,299
download it its life let's block it same

471
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:31,720
for alive c2 but you can have some

472
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,320
pretty old indicators and in this case

473
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,630
maybe you should still trigger on an out

474
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,299
so that you know that maybe this machine

475
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:42,160
has been compromised but think twice

476
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,660
before blacking so in the fight again

477
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,600
both net we never talk about ISPs sales

478
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,240
they have a pretty blue or we can take

479
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,700
down infrastructures and they can work

480
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,350
with researchers and no in France man so

481
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,059
there's a new sample out or a new

482
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:03,850
campaign and this is what happens so

483
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,419
people come across it researchers come

484
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:10,870
across it to talk about it then you can

485
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:14,590
see some references to it on Twitter and

486
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:17,440
kernel mode and other forums and people

487
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,570
keep talking about it and there are from

488
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,970
VT comments about it and situated under

489
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,669
oath starts to block it so everybody is

490
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:29,140
aware of it that's great awesome even

491
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,980
twin bed what is that thing on the

492
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,340
bottom right well actually this little

493
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,450
green box is VI ESP where the thing

494
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,720
everybody is talking about is hosted

495
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,750
nobody talks to it well maybe after a

496
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,760
while somebody is going to tell the AC

497
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,090
hey there's something wrong okay looked

498
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:57,040
cool all right this happened what

499
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,410
happens next people keep talking about

500
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:04,000
it still there is it dangerous this guy

501
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,419
is sad

502
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,730
well the thing is even though the ISP

503
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:14,340
took down something this ice P is not

504
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,929
gonna get in touch with everybody is

505
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:18,539
saying hey this is what we did no it's

506
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,490
too time-consuming nobody's going to do

507
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:25,740
that so that's pretty sad I space can

508
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,769
I'm Sarah bunch of interesting questions

509
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:32,010
like there was something wrong is it

510
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,669
fixed now when was it fixed or was

511
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:42,059
anything done after a report and also

512
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:44,130
interesting thing is that like you come

513
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:47,429
across iocs in the report an apt report

514
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:49,559
for example from five years ago and you

515
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,809
can see that there's still something on

516
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:53,700
this IP and it's suspicious like it's a

517
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,760
44 engine X error page just suspicious

518
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,610
well is it still the same actor behind

519
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,230
this IP can be a super interesting

520
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,700
information even for Rowan front sment

521
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,539
still today there's no way to know about

522
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:14,130
this kind of information another

523
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,100
interesting thing we often observe that

524
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,889
whenever server is serving something

525
00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:22,679
malicious this is a new customer or at

526
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:25,409
least a new account so if you're

527
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:28,289
building reputation systems you're

528
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:31,169
probably using features such as when

529
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:33,929
why's the domain registered traffic

530
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:36,929
thing like that if you can have such a

531
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,450
feature that could be super useful you

532
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,570
can improve your model still only the

533
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:47,730
ISP knows about that given a single IP

534
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:52,710
is this IP just owned by one guy or

535
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,889
share by two hundred different people

536
00:26:55,889 --> 00:26:58,409
that's another different question which

537
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:01,019
can be super interesting both for

538
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,240
investigations and for improving your

539
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:09,210
prototype models so right now if you

540
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,500
want to answer this kind of questions

541
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,990
well you have to find a point of contact

542
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,179
you have to send emails you have to

543
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:18,210
cross your fingers you have to wait it's

544
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,010
really painful right just

545
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,990
one on one communications and this is

546
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,730
not something you can automate let's

547
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:35,460
change this so this is a proposal this

548
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,430
is a language it's called dip this is a

549
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,280
language to describe changes made by a

550
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,950
nice p like this IP is not a sign emo

551
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,370
this IP as a new customer this IP was

552
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:51,350
taken down so these are observations

553
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,210
it's not about talking about incidents

554
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,850
we already have things such as takes to

555
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,550
describe incidents this is about changes

556
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:06,780
before and after an incident so in order

557
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,810
for it to get some traction it has to

558
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,270
expert changes without disclosing

559
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:15,590
personal customer information

560
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:21,240
furthermore this is a way to describe

561
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,100
changes so we have a set of events but

562
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:31,740
events must provide only facts and feeds

563
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,050
can be private or public

564
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,789
and it has to be super simple simple to

565
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:46,330
understand implement and deploy so once

566
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:49,120
again sticks is amazing but first it's

567
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,850
XML it's really tough to get started to

568
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,100
write something new using sticks so that

569
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,380
people just use a very small subset name

570
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:00,730
is Sai bugs dip has been designed to be

571
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,549
very very simple you can get started in

572
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:10,840
10 minutes so this is a dip event it's

573
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,549
made of a bunch of properties this is a

574
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:14,740
fixed set of properties for a given

575
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,470
value of dip you're going to have this

576
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,360
set of properties nothing less nothing

577
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,070
more so each property has an ID unique

578
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,500
ID nothing fancy a time stamp to see

579
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,010
just the unix timestamp and a bunch of

580
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:33,490
different things first a type and a

581
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:36,039
resource ID so this is what we're

582
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:39,070
talking about some change was made to

583
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,630
one to the main to a name several record

584
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,600
to a website to a specific pass on a

585
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,519
website into an email an IP or sunette

586
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:51,309
you might be like hey something's

587
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:54,100
missing I want sample signatures and

588
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,710
stuff nope you already have tons of

589
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,590
tools and protocols to store signatures

590
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,990
and actors and campaigns and stuff like

591
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:05,110
that this is not a replacement for that

592
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,120
this is just to fill a small gap which

593
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,779
is missing so this is a fixed set of

594
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:13,510
resource types for a given version of

595
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:17,559
this language and then we describe what

596
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:20,139
happened to this IP to this server to

597
00:30:20,139 --> 00:30:23,350
the subnet to this domain name so once

598
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,779
that you can get is a sign which means

599
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:28,059
that we have a new customer it doesn't

600
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,490
mean that the previous one is gone or

601
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:33,549
the previous ones are gone just just a

602
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:35,740
new one so if you have multiple

603
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,480
customers behind a single IP you're

604
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,850
going to have multiple events with this

605
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:44,740
specific state now we can see resolved

606
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,320
resolved mean that it's going to be used

607
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,669
by the ISP itself so this IP is not

608
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:53,500
going to be assigned to any customer

609
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,320
so if you see something bad well the ISP

610
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:04,210
is shady unassign some customer at a

611
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,340
specific IP now it's not the case

612
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,830
anymore the IP is not gone maybe we

613
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,010
still have a bunch of owners for this IP

614
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:17,260
let's just one less sustain it so

615
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,120
sometimes we find suspicious stuff and

616
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,800
we want to get in touch with the

617
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,290
customer is that all because we want

618
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:29,470
some extra details or we just want to

619
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,300
give a chance to the customer to fix it

620
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,720
quickly so we just drop an email saying

621
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,220
hey this is what we found it suspicious

622
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,510
fix it and if we get a response before

623
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:44,890
24 hours and it's okay everything was

624
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:47,470
fixed looks clean now we can restore the

625
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,600
service if we don't get any response or

626
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,210
if it's we just take down the

627
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,990
server so this state means that the

628
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,790
server is not taken down we just block

629
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,280
the traffic until we get some response

630
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:05,260
from the customer resumed alright we go

631
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,130
to response all clean ready to go again

632
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:14,020
we just unblock the traffic clean this

633
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,340
is typically to report false positives

634
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,830
so this is the ISP saying hey we

635
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,750
reviewed this specific website this

636
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,540
specific IP we didn't find anything and

637
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,760
maybe we reviewed it after seeing

638
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,950
something in some black list or maybe

639
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:34,390
after you send something and we think

640
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:37,300
it's clean so it doesn't mean that you

641
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,150
have to whitelist this I p sub or

642
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,090
whatever when you see this kind of event

643
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,880
it just a hint just something you can

644
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,070
consider like if you get an email from a

645
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,290
customer saying hey my web site was

646
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,850
compromised it's not the case anymore oh

647
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:55,270
please unblock me you can check where

648
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:58,030
the ISP thanks if you see that the ISP

649
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,610
thinks that it's clean all right it's

650
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,670
going to wait in a little bit so I just

651
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:06,580
in many cattle that you can use

652
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:10,790
notified so in this case everything is

653
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,000
still up and running but still we know

654
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,520
that something malicious was observed on

655
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,470
this specific server IP domain whatever

656
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,010
and we got in touch with a crystal

657
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:26,240
saying hey fix it so if you know about

658
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,370
something malicious and still live it's

659
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,890
in here you can check whether or the ISP

660
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:34,100
actually did something or not even if

661
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,220
you just open an abuse report and you

662
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,830
don't see anything well you can still

663
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,560
check that and you know if the SP is

664
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,620
doing something or not and you can see

665
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,110
when so you don't know what exactly you

666
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,660
just know that the I speed did something

667
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,100
and got in touch with a customer about

668
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:57,890
the security problem clean all right it

669
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,420
was malicious it was compromised

670
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,190
whatever it's not the case anymore and

671
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,770
the ISP itself says I think it's safe

672
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,920
now my customer did everything and now

673
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,790
it's probably safe do you need it so I

674
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,639
think this is the last date and it

675
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,590
doesn't exist anymore so if you see this

676
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,530
kind of event with an IP it means that

677
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,449
the IP doesn't belong to the ISP anymore

678
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:23,389
it was sold to a different company this

679
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:24,650
is something you see most of the time

680
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:27,560
for domain names but still it can be for

681
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,949
subnets IP whatever so it's not gonna be

682
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:33,050
a sign to any customers anymore not even

683
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:37,730
to the ISP so I've been talking about

684
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,739
about owners so the only rule is that

685
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:45,590
whenever the real owner changes you have

686
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:49,090
to change this value so how to do that

687
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:52,370
well you can use real information from

688
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,610
the customer if you're cool with that

689
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,320
that's great throwing out the case

690
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,810
another thing you can do is use a unique

691
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,820
ID you probably already have one for

692
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,190
your accounts this is by ready because

693
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,850
you can see all the things or specific

694
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:10,190
customer owns and maybe this is

695
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,540
something customers don't want to

696
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:16,640
disclose you can use a counter that's a

697
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,820
terrible idea in general why because you

698
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,070
can

699
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,680
estimate how many customers specific ISP

700
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,500
or reseller as and it might not match

701
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,320
your marketing numbers so don't do that

702
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,420
so what I recommend is just use a

703
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,580
permutation function or just some random

704
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:39,420
ID it's still important to have an ID

705
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,970
even if it's random because you you can

706
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,790
use it to link this specific event two

707
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:48,150
different systems such as creates or

708
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:53,460
whatever and if you want to do that link

709
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,780
to some type events with your system

710
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,120
well you can use the very last property

711
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,280
which is just call Reardon and then you

712
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,110
can insert erasing any kind of ids and

713
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,720
if you have a private deep fin with

714
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,290
someone selling or telling you

715
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:12,000
constantly this is the kind of thing I

716
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,040
found on your network a couple days ago

717
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,830
please investigate well you can send a

718
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,870
specific idea to take a tidy or maybe a

719
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:21,270
sweepy specific URL that was mentioned

720
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,790
before so this is a way to link things

721
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:29,130
together now SPS can have resource and

722
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:33,570
if every single reseller publishes their

723
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:36,990
own field is going to be Jedi messy then

724
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,950
you have to subscribe to everything so

725
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,140
what can be done is actually some kind

726
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:47,970
of aggregation so the ice P itself is

727
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,100
going to consume defense from

728
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,590
researchers and publish everything as a

729
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:56,970
single feed so we have this probably

730
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,980
cold depths which is basically the

731
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,870
number of hops this information is

732
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,480
coming from so when you emit a new event

733
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,030
the depth is always zero when you

734
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,310
consume an event you just do a +1 on

735
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,720
these steps so we have two resource r1

736
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,220
r2 sending events to the ISP and then

737
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,590
this is the public fin that anybody can

738
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,570
consume and you can see two events

739
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,640
coming from whistles with a depth of one

740
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,190
at the last even where I stand by the

741
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,820
ISP itself so you can assign different

742
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,040
trust levels according to the number of

743
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,029
hops if you want to

744
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,150
but one thing an SP can do is maybe

745
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,450
double check or just confirm things like

746
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,430
you have a reseller and this reseller

747
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,099
tells you a I just took down this

748
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,079
specific server well the ice P can

749
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:51,690
confirm that okay the IP is not used

750
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:54,690
anymore i can see that on the switch so

751
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:59,790
the HP can lower of the deaths just as a

752
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:03,089
way to say hey we double check this even

753
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:05,520
if it comes from a reseller now you can

754
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,829
assign the same trust level to this

755
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:11,070
specific event as a possible you assign

756
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:23,460
to us so feed our distant rice so every

757
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,619
single I speak an have their own feed

758
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:28,920
private and or public and then you can

759
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,349
choose all right I trust this is P I'm

760
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:34,079
going to consume the field and same

761
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,030
thing for eyes peas I speak and consume

762
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:39,540
feeds from Wizards the trust and if

763
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,310
something goes wrong with one of them

764
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:44,760
like this guy is constantly saying hey

765
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,200
so false positive it's a false positive

766
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,450
but nope is still like it's still bad

767
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:55,460
you can just stop consuming a feel so

768
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,069
deep events are just key values super

769
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:00,930
simple so you can use pretty much any

770
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:05,490
standard format protobuf even CSV

771
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,460
remember the set of keys is fixed so at

772
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,280
super convenient super easy to implement

773
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,170
but we recommend that all

774
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:16,130
implementations support at least Jason

775
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:20,099
fair enough what about transport well

776
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:23,150
taxi is a good candidate Texas great

777
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:27,089
well usually taxis used with XML because

778
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:29,369
of sticks but it works equally well with

779
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:33,780
JSON so you can use tax in or you can

780
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,619
use any chewing mechanism but the

781
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:41,280
minimum we recommend implementation to

782
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,609
implement is several send events which

783
00:39:44,609 --> 00:39:47,220
is just HTTP with a very simple

784
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,619
man this it's very easy to implement

785
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:52,440
both server-side and client-side so this

786
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,109
is a bare minimum we recommend for any

787
00:39:55,109 --> 00:40:01,080
sticks any dip implementation let's take

788
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:06,270
a look at some examples so a son that

789
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,510
was assigned to somebody else so we can

790
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:13,710
see two events the first event has a

791
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:16,109
reference to a previous owner so we

792
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:18,570
under an assigned event before we the

793
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:21,720
same owner ID and then we see an assign

794
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,560
and right after this event we are the

795
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,990
timestamp right here this specific so

796
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,109
net is not owned by anyone by the ISP

797
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:35,130
but it's not used anymore and then later

798
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:38,190
on you can see a new owner owning the

799
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:44,300
specific subnet so two events / decimal

800
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,800
this is a response to a fishing report

801
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,700
this is in four ports so the first event

802
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,339
is about a specific pass on a specific

803
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:57,540
domain specific website and as you can

804
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,320
see what the I speed is not take down

805
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,920
the server but part of the traffic was

806
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,000
blocked a specific URL was blocked but

807
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,510
the website itself is still live so you

808
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:16,680
can see when it happened and then the

809
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,260
file itself was removed you can see

810
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,359
deleted so the website is still there

811
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,609
everything else on the same domain is

812
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:25,380
still up and running but this specific

813
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:30,270
web page doesn't exist anymore after a

814
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:34,230
while JSP reviewed the website itself

815
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,440
there was more crap on it so the website

816
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,180
itself was taken down and then the

817
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,089
domain name itself was removed so you

818
00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:46,740
can see for different events because

819
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,849
everything doesn't happen at the same

820
00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:53,010
time and in addition to that having four

821
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,750
events is super useful because you might

822
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,730
be looking for just one specific event

823
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,190
maybe you're just interested in domain

824
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,020
name changes so you can just

825
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:07,260
for one event so let's see different

826
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,030
things upon this is a response to a spam

827
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:13,590
report so this is a response to a

828
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:18,540
private email or private feed and you

829
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,380
can see a link to whatever reference we

830
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,580
had in the email and you can see

831
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,960
notified so at this time nothing really

832
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,040
happened from a user perspective the

833
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,440
server is still up and running nothing

834
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,650
has changed but you can see that the ISP

835
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:43,380
got in touch with the customer to tell

836
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:47,880
hey we go to spam report and then what

837
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,280
you can see is clean it wasn't a spam it

838
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,290
was marketing campaign was totally

839
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:55,500
legitimate so you can see a different

840
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:03,180
event last example this is a response to

841
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:07,710
a compromise server run by a reseller so

842
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,800
you have a first event sent by the

843
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,000
reseller about a specific here yes this

844
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,960
is repressed and reference two sticks

845
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,140
observable and the researcher says hey

846
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,960
now it's clean I took to the customer

847
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,210
everything was reinstalled from scratch

848
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,970
now it's clean and then you can see

849
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:33,210
exactly the same even but so that is

850
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:37,080
zero so the ISP reviewed that double

851
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,950
checked everything and yes it's clean

852
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:45,810
and that was about a specific pass on

853
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:50,580
example.com but then the whole website

854
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,440
was reviewed and was found to be clean

855
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,750
as well so this is not about the domain

856
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,510
name this is about the website when you

857
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,790
see we host this is a website only so

858
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,560
maybe there is something wrong on the

859
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,600
domain name still what was revealed is

860
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:08,510
only the white side here so that's cool

861
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:10,800
everybody can consume this kind of feel

862
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,260
learn a lot about what is PS are doing

863
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,090
but sometimes you want to answer or some

864
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,550
different questions like when was this

865
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:21,490
IP assigned to the current owner well if

866
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:24,600
you want to answer this you have to

867
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,910
replay everything you have to store

868
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:30,430
everything in a database it's not really

869
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:32,950
convenient right how many incidents were

870
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,930
reported in a dress on this website in a

871
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:37,660
given time frame same thing you have to

872
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,760
be constantly retrieving the feed

873
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,230
storing everything to answer this

874
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:43,840
question while you can do that of course

875
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,570
you can the same sum that shared by many

876
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:49,170
customers this is a way to spot Syrians

877
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:51,610
well same thing you have to observe

878
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:54,040
everything to know how many customers we

879
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,430
have another single IP so in order to do

880
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:59,980
so well you have to write some code

881
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:03,700
aight restoring everything and in order

882
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:07,630
to get you started there is an

883
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:10,300
implementation so it's settled prototype

884
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,090
it's cool Ares so it provides a

885
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:15,640
http-based API to answer this kind of

886
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,120
questions so you can use it to send

887
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,180
queries such as a I got this IP I want

888
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,370
to know the state of this IP at a given

889
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:27,190
point in time who owned is who owns it

890
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:32,290
since when and you can also get some

891
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:35,290
intelligence given time frame you can

892
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:39,760
see or what happened 12 a sign on a sign

893
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,580
and then the owner was notified about

894
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,160
something wrong so this is a very easy

895
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:51,430
way to answer the previous questions so

896
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:55,060
I did well dip is a way to learn about

897
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:58,480
what is peas are doing can be very very

898
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,090
useful to researchers law enforcement

899
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,940
because you learn about things

900
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,320
immediately you don't have to wait and

901
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,810
contact people you can do it as a second

902
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:12,040
step and if you report something you can

903
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,050
check if the SP is actually doing

904
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:19,360
something or not for ice peace one of

905
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,160
the first thing I learned is that it's

906
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,050
really really easy to get into a black

907
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:25,330
is it's very tough to get out of

908
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:26,970
blacklist

909
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:28,830
sometimes you just send an email you

910
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:30,780
never get any answer sometimes you don't

911
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,940
have any point of contact sometimes you

912
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,920
just get a response that says hey it's

913
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,430
just automated cool so it's a way for

914
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:43,020
isps to tell to dressed everybody this

915
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,060
is what we did waving this is a false

916
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,640
positive to whatever you out with this

917
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,680
information but we just publish it

918
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,070
publicly and for customers you can see

919
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:54,750
what is PS are doing which might be

920
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:58,200
nothing or you can see that okay this IP

921
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,750
has a lot of badness but they're pretty

922
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:05,640
reactive to do something so if you want

923
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,070
to discuss this protocol if you want to

924
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:10,350
implement it if you want to change it if

925
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:13,620
you have heidi's check out this website

926
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,240
it's going to be online right left--oh

927
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:20,250
to talk and it's on github so there is a

928
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,200
file with a specification so feel free

929
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,320
to open tickets and pull request to

930
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,600
change it and hopefully it's good i get

931
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,130
some traction and it's going to be great

932
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:32,280
for everybody and thank you so much for

933
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,050
your attention now we have some time for

934
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:36,360
questions and one of the questions can

935
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,740
be can you make a quick demo

936
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:53,460
we have only one minute so I I suggest

937
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,569
you make the demo okay and you ask

938
00:47:57,569 --> 00:48:00,599
questions later tonight alright that

939
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:04,559
works so a demo of an API is not super

940
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:11,099
fun kidding guys read all right so this

941
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:13,500
is a demo of errors so this is the

942
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:17,640
http-based API to answer the questions I

943
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,030
described previously so let's see this

944
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:24,000
is just a random IP and you can see the

945
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,819
state of this IP right now so let me

946
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:28,530
scroll down a little bit so you can see

947
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:31,980
that we have something like five owners

948
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,319
right now which doesn't mean that in the

949
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:38,130
past we had on more honest and actually

950
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:40,349
you can see that we had since this IP

951
00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:43,079
has been assigned 11 owners with our

952
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:46,950
five IT right now so at this piece of

953
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:48,809
software is a trade doing is replaying

954
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:51,210
all the events combining everything and

955
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:53,880
then you get some summary so this is

956
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,569
just given a specific IP you can add

957
00:48:57,569 --> 00:49:00,869
some constraints like I want to see

958
00:49:00,869 --> 00:49:02,549
everything that happened after a

959
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:11,339
specific time frame oops so okay let's

960
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:15,359
do this try out all right so you can see

961
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,789
that a few thing happen this IP was

962
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:20,309
unassigned so one less customer on it

963
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:22,440
and a new customer and so on and so

964
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,329
forth since this specific date we can

965
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:29,940
perform lockups on subnets and maybe

966
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:35,490
we're going to see the same IP let's see

967
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:41,400
the whole may be swell / 24 and I want

968
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,470
to see everything since the beginning

969
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:49,230
all right so you can see what happened

970
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:53,160
and we can look for specific events like

971
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,020
I want to know when this thing was

972
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,019
suspended and

973
00:49:57,019 --> 00:49:59,659
when maybe the customer was notified

974
00:49:59,659 --> 00:50:03,890
just to see if this IP or this subnet is

975
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:08,499
likely to be Shelly or not so I can see

976
00:50:08,499 --> 00:50:11,869
it's events and you can see all the

977
00:50:11,869 --> 00:50:14,809
notifications made to customers on this

978
00:50:14,809 --> 00:50:16,909
specific subnet and you can do a bunch

979
00:50:16,909 --> 00:50:18,649
of other things such as count or many

980
00:50:18,649 --> 00:50:20,630
customer you have even for just a

981
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:22,569
