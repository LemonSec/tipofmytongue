00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,720
last session of vodka 2015 Peter Keisler

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,230
on sanity you have the floor thank you

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,660
sir my name is Peter Keisler I work for

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,849
lookingglass a US company as a

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,100
programmer and security researcher I

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,279
started my own company in 2013 and they

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:21,750
just acquired my company a few months

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,330
ago I'm running virus strike a sinkhole

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,800
operating system and we see a lot of

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,230
infections about sanity and so it is a

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,000
very interesting trojan it is very old

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,149
but there's a lot of infections it has

13
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:35,370
we see about daily 2 million unique IP

14
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,430
addresses every day it's in operation

15
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,110
since 2003 and it's still actively doing

16
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,270
stuff so I'm going to jump right in so

17
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,309
Saturday they said it's according to

18
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,710
Simon Dec the first samples started to

19
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,760
appear in 2003 they say it's from Russia

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,620
based on the first versions the first

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,960
versions they were sending out emails to

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,670
the attackers with stolen information

23
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,890
and there were some multiple indicators

24
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,400
that operators were originating from

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,909
Russia it's very interesting botnet

26
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,390
because it's very large and there's not

27
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,850
much coverage by antivirus companies in

28
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,580
terms of like publications there are

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,189
some very few but not that many it's

30
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:24,990
very easy to detect it it's also very

31
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,420
easy to remove it but the thing is that

32
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,189
most of the infections they're active in

33
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,540
third world countries where they don't

34
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,509
have antivirus systems installed or they

35
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,729
don't have operating systems updates

36
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,360
installed at all and sadly it's just

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,850
it's like a multi-purpose botnet the

38
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,020
first versions they were just like

39
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,000
stealing stuff like - all the LA Kings

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,640
and now they are sending out spam and

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,259
installing additional meta

42
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,810
I never observed that they would start

43
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,890
any DDoS attacks or any banking fraud

44
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,350
which is also I think part of the reason

45
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,740
why there was not the run of many

46
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,689
weepers about it so they're like kinda

47
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,920
staying under the radar and there was no

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,300
new version since like since 2011 twelve

49
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,100
different like No

50
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,830
new technical features implemented

51
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,200
they're just using it and you can watch

52
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,380
how monthly cell EDD button it shrinks

53
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,040
and gets smaller but it's still a lot

54
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,470
and it has some advanced features in it

55
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,240
at least for a time where it was being

56
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,420
implemented it's it's a filing factor so

57
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,130
it affects all your executables on your

58
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,840
machine and if you then share any

59
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,900
executable anyone else then it

60
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,240
distributes initially it was sent out in

61
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,550
email spam as an attachment and it has a

62
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,890
p2p algorithm they're two active

63
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,240
peer-to-peer networks they are

64
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,740
independent from each other the

65
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,290
protocols of the p2p botnets of those

66
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,450
two are nearly identical there's a

67
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,130
network three and four other still

68
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,810
active one it's a little bit bigger than

69
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,600
network three is bigger and the

70
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,460
difference between those two p2p botnets

71
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,850
is only the one uses are as a 1024 bit

72
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,940
in the other one 2048 to secure the

73
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:17,300
updates they have they don't have a real

74
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,310
C&C mechanism what they have is days

75
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,460
supply binary updates inside the

76
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,560
peer-to-peer botnets they exchange a

77
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,080
list of URLs and from those URLs LED

78
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,790
downloads the payload basically and I

79
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,050
don't have any information whether the

80
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,020
LED guys who developed like the in

81
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,300
factor and the drop-off whether they

82
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,910
also use it for their own purposes

83
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,050
already like rented out that was not the

84
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,270
goal of my analysis I wanted to check

85
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,400
out how many factions there are and get

86
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,170
to bigger picture and we found some very

87
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,420
interesting things in the first versions

88
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,400
the in the first versions develop some

89
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,530
indicators and they intentionally left

90
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,360
some messages in the earliest versions

91
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,890
in 2003 and 2004 and right now here we

92
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,060
see up to 2 million now it's a little

93
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,090
bit down it's because people then at

94
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,390
some point to install a be an AV or

95
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,950
installed operating system updates or

96
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,140
just get a new computer and I estimate

97
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,250
that there are about 4 million

98
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,560
infections worldwide based on the

99
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,019
coverage so we have a peer to peer

100
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,700
crawler hooked up in both peer to peer

101
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,729
networks which runs 24/7 and just

102
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:27,000
connects to every peer and ask for

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,590
neighbors and then we store all that

104
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,880
information in our database and we also

105
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,180
tracked the domains actually the URL

106
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,800
hacks that are being shared inside the

107
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,020
peer-to-peer botnets and we track them

108
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,290
and then we try to single them so when

109
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,420
the infected machines try to download

110
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,830
the payload they actually contact our

111
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,340
server and then we see the HTTP requests

112
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,780
and then we see like the user agent IP

113
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,010
words coming from and I think not many

114
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,450
people are aware of it that it's still

115
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,960
like such a huge threat because when you

116
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,460
have two million infections you can do a

117
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,919
lot of stuff you could DDoS entire

118
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,830
countries if you take out internet

119
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,050
exchange points or it could potentially

120
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,140
like take down some stock exchange well

121
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,800
they're definitely off bottlenecks and

122
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,120
like I mentioned in a past few years

123
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,430
there were no new technical features in

124
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,870
it it was just running and they are

125
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,080
still like pushing out those ul peg

126
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,140
updates in a peer-to-peer botnets there

127
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,410
are now about only 300,000 infections in

128
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,140
a peer-to-peer botnets is interesting to

129
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,270
mention because the operators of sanity

130
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,090
they probably only control about like

131
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,240
three to five or 700,000 infections and

132
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,790
we see way more than them because we

133
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,430
track all the old versions even though

134
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,470
those going back to 2003 and we still

135
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,500
see a lot of infections of very old

136
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,729
variants so we see more said infectious

137
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:58,110
than the protists themselves it's an

138
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,870
interesting fact so this shows one of

139
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,160
the first versions so they were like

140
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,740
putting in a message and putting in some

141
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,979
some version strings which is good for

142
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,720
analysis you can track the different

143
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,860
versions

144
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,930
certainly the infects all executables so

145
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,669
when you check out virus total and some

146
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:16,950
samples you will see a lot of samples

147
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,930
that are infected by LED that they are

148
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,000
not salad in themselves you will also

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,310
see like a lot of corrupted windows

150
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,120
files in the early versions they it was

151
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,860
infecting just every single fire from

152
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,720
that also from the operating system

153
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,340
which is pretty annoying because then

154
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,570
you would pretty much have to reinstall

155
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,930
the operating system so you will come

156
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,060
around like a lot of Venus XP infected

157
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,470
system files on Marshall

158
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,100
and sometimes you have to really be

159
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,510
careful when you check out the solidity

160
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,040
samples if it's really a salary sample

161
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,500
or just an infection or antivirus

162
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,700
companies sometimes name it wrongly so

163
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,260
we have some interesting information

164
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,810
about the author right now if you want

165
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,420
to like try to catch the guy you can't

166
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,160
really there's not like a central CNC

167
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,620
there's only the pewter people network

168
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,500
exchange the URLs and the URLs they

169
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,400
point to compromised legitimate websites

170
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,190
I believe they use the stone of any

171
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,550
information like FTP credentials of some

172
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,110
people to upload their malicious

173
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,390
binaries there and I mean you could

174
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,710
potentially maybe if you get access to

175
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,120
the server you could check out the logs

176
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,480
and see who uploaded the binary but out

177
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,670
internet in a p2p botnet you will not

178
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,940
find the author

179
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,790
so Simon check did a really good report

180
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,550
and this shows an email and exfiltration

181
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,540
email sent by early LED version from

182
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,330
2004 and in there there are mentioned

183
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,180
three nicknames there's one mentioned

184
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,980
sector one immature and alien set and

185
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,090
the interesting thing about this all

186
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,980
version is so they sent a stolen

187
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,440
information locally by email to the

188
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,990
attacker so we have three email

189
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,470
addresses and the reason why eyetality

190
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,220
it's because they say it's from Salavat

191
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,820
city city in russia which appears in the

192
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,860
expectation emails in the subject so we

193
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,510
have those three nicknames and we have

194
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,370
the email addresses where it was being

195
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,160
sent to and I have some really cool

196
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,669
awesome slides about one guy and I'm not

197
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:33,479
showing you them for privacy reasons if

198
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,630
you look up the one email here you will

199
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,349
find like kind of like Russian Facebook

200
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:42,929
profile a social media profile so

201
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,630
apparently the guy was using this email

202
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,450
to send the stolen information to and

203
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,790
also for his social media profile and

204
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,890
it's still up there and it like matches

205
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,060
everything that we know every

206
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,160
that Simon tech knows about the authors

207
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,110
I don't believe he's still active there

208
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,210
anymore according to what he publishes

209
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,810
on his on his social media but I believe

210
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,930
he was probably allegedly helping them

211
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,110
in the early days in 2003 and 4 so you

212
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,270
find like when you looked it up then you

213
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,220
will see he's also like advertising on

214
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,279
his web site SEO stuff and he's living

215
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,760
in the Salavat city in Russia and it was

216
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,680
kind of interesting and when you execute

217
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,720
the old samples of sanity they won't run

218
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,820
anymore on Windows 7 so had to execute

219
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,980
them in minutes XP and then it still

220
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,960
tried to send out emails which were not

221
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,650
work because they are using the SMTP

222
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,630
server of milord are you they're not

223
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,660
authenticating they are not using any

224
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,880
not TLS or SSL you anything at all so

225
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,890
it's not successful anymore those emails

226
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:49,230
so this is our infection statistics in

227
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,750
Mars tracker this is both the

228
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,270
peer-to-peer botnets the data from our

229
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,990
p2p crawlers but also what we see you on

230
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,450
our main base tinkles and the reason why

231
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,860
it's going up so much because we got

232
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,200
more coverage and the reason why it's

233
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,350
going down over the times because people

234
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,390
disinfect their machine at some point

235
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,060
and they disappeared there were some

236
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,630
spikes like here that I couldn't explain

237
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,430
I was checking it out so we have like we

238
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,530
have tons of domains and all together

239
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,360
and all sinkhole we have like more than

240
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,910
10,000 domains and a lot of sanity and

241
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,600
on like here for example we lost about

242
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,780
like quite a lot like something between

243
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,970
1500 K machines from one day to other

244
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,400
and I couldn't explain it I I don't know

245
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,540
why those machines don't appear anymore

246
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,690
maybe they update it that specifically

247
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:48,510
like one part of it and but still like

248
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,370
yeah it's it's going down over the time

249
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,950
but it's still a lot so right now we see

250
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,560
about roughly 1.5 million unique apiece

251
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,800
and we only see a portion of it because

252
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,200
we don't have all the main sync all of

253
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,560
it

254
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,950
so roughly 20 percent we observe on the

255
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,550
peer-to-peer network

256
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,740
we have custom p2p crawlers that just

257
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,040
run 24/7 we have one running in the US

258
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,580
with one running in in Prague and it's

259
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,930
connecting and real-time to all the

260
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,700
machines at one point our peer-to-peer

261
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,190
crawler was connected to one million

262
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,760
machine it was back in early 2014 and I

263
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,590
was was cool to see when you have like

264
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,350
one machine connected to 1 million IPs

265
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,090
that's like when you reach the limit of

266
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,000
like your everything like your local

267
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,190
network like you won't have any open TCP

268
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,000
ports anymore or any parts you will run

269
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,870
like out of CPU and everything so that

270
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,670
was interesting to see and like I

271
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,340
mentioned most infections are like in

272
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,760
third world countries so top one India

273
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,760
Egypt yet Nam Pakistan Iran and in

274
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,430
countries like us or Germany there are

275
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,280
the like the least infections and that's

276
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,650
because if you just have operating

277
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,600
system updates installed you will lose

278
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,750
the queue against it and if you check

279
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,120
like this led samples on March 12 they

280
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,630
always have a very good coverage they

281
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,490
are like detected nearly hundred percent

282
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,790
nearly by every antivirus and that's

283
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,770
very interesting to mention so it's very

284
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,340
easy to remove the burliest

285
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,960
well the earliest version they have a

286
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,560
rootkit but only for 32-bit and it was

287
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,210
it's a very small rootkit just four

288
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:31,720
kilobytes

289
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,530
it's a driver which is terminating or

290
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,810
trying to terminate antivirus processes

291
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,580
and also preventing other packets that

292
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,610
contain certain strings but it's not

293
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,810
really effective anymore and we had over

294
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,940
we had in total for DDoS attacks against

295
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,970
our sinkhole service so I believe that

296
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,190
three of them were attributed to salad

297
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,070
II there are some indicators so the

298
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,590
first one was one gigabit per second

299
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,080
DDoS attack and then just a few weeks

300
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,210
later we were hit by a 10 gigabit per

301
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,520
second and any March this year we were

302
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,860
hit by a hundred 20 gigabits per second

303
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,420
DDoS attack and here you can see the you

304
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,760
can see the snapshot from the network

305
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,650
traffic all now a sinkhole servers we

306
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,630
always said we see like the

307
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,940
infected machines coming in in waves

308
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,380
like we see them in the night it goes a

309
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,640
little bit down and then during the day

310
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,250
a little bit up we also see during the

311
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,540
week that we see more in the most

312
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,600
infectious on Wednesday and then it goes

313
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,400
down on Saturday and on Sunday it's the

314
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,660
least and then it goes up again on

315
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,210
Monday so based on our network traffic I

316
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,220
can say which day of the week it is and

317
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,420
here you can see the data that we got

318
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,440
from the data center on the DDoS attacks

319
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,330
there was in the first two DDoS attacks

320
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,820
there was one address doing it

321
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,840
TCP DDoS and I looked him up in our

322
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,880
database and we found that on the same

323
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,620
day where the DDoS was it was a known

324
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,630
salad infection this could be a

325
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,380
coincidence

326
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,960
but it's a very strong indication that

327
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,270
in both instances it was infected with

328
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,120
salad II and sadly they mix up like

329
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,600
roughly 2/3 of our data and we don't

330
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,310
hide the fact that we're seeing calling

331
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,830
it like if you check our sinkhole or a

332
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,630
single domain stand you will see that

333
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,890
there are registered trusts it says

334
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,600
specifically virus tracker in the

335
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,610
registration data so there were four

336
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,010
different p2p networks but only two of

337
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:35,240
them are active network 3 & 4 and they

338
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,390
just exchanged appear lists basically

339
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,220
inside the p2p Network the neighbors and

340
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,930
they exchanged the UL packs where the

341
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,990
download binaries there is no real CNC

342
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,580
mechanism inside it there's like no way

343
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,430
that the operator could send a command

344
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,250
to do something or do anything he has to

345
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,740
just push out and you executable and

346
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,600
basically that's what we do if you know

347
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,220
all the URL pecks then you can try to

348
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,350
sing call them and see about who is

349
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,790
infected in real time it's very simple

350
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,800
but effective trojan it injects the

351
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,630
earth first version was injecting into

352
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,730
exploded exe now it's a random process

353
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,430
and from Darren we'll just operate it

354
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,380
will try to contact a predefined list of

355
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,410
IP addresses to start communicating in

356
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,170
the into the peer-to-peer network and it

357
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,740
will try to contact URLs to download

358
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,390
additional binaries to do additional

359
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,970
stuff

360
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,009
here it was injecting into TCP view and

361
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:39,769
analyzing it is very simple you can just

362
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:42,019
literally drop it in your VM execute it

363
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:46,429
and then watch in Wireshark and and

364
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:51,049
using some debuggers to analyze it the

365
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:55,220
p2p algorithm is very flat simple but

366
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,919
also effective it's not like complicated

367
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,269
like the zoo scheme appear to be

368
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:01,939
everything there are not like master

369
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:03,290
nodes they are all like on the same

370
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,470
level and there's no like distinction

371
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,009
the only thing is they keep an internal

372
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:12,589
value about whether that but it's a

373
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:14,359
super node or not like accessible from

374
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:18,230
the outside or not here you can see it's

375
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,939
very nice and you can detect it easily

376
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:23,869
it's literally doing just UDP

377
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:26,629
connections to those ports which should

378
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:28,819
connect to so it's it's very easy to

379
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:31,419
detect both on the network but also

380
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:34,519
locally on the machine when you you can

381
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,350
check like for the mutexes of it or you

382
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,019
can check yeah just a network traffic

383
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:42,529
locally or also if you know all your

384
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:45,739
files are suddenly infected and network

385
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:49,279
for has a second change to network 3 it

386
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,009
opens the tcp port to exchange files

387
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:53,959
it basically exchanges the same files

388
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:55,699
that it would normally download through

389
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:58,790
the u.s. so on network for we don't see

390
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,720
any new URLs being exchanged rather it

391
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,359
uses the built-in peer-to-peer methyl it

392
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,010
was it's a little bit annoying because

393
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,029
they rear-end TCP will they open a new

394
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:15,740
port for every connection which makes no

395
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,689
sense at all for UDP they also have like

396
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:21,138
ok responses which also don't make much

397
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:24,019
sense they have three very basic

398
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:27,709
commands one is an announcement trusting

399
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:30,370
here I am and then the other is

400
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,330
exchanging the peer list and then

401
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:36,320
there's also the the pack exchange the

402
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,139
URL list and on network for you can also

403
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:42,529
exchange files and what we did the the

404
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,600
way we could know that all these old URL

405
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,670
packs like all these old versions is

406
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,850
my p2p Corolla extracts the UL pecs that

407
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,910
are being shared and very often an ultra

408
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,560
version is joining the p2p Network and

409
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,380
then it sends then it has still like the

410
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,690
old URL pack from I don't like even a

411
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,120
few years ago and then we started all in

412
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,340
the file and then we use that as an

413
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,560
input to single them because there are

414
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,450
many zombie infections that are around

415
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,100
that that are still infected but they

416
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,320
don't report to it anywhere like they

417
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,030
are not connected to the p8 via network

418
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:17,570
anymore

419
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,090
and the you all that you do or else

420
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,000
they're also out of date so over one

421
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,710
year you could see a strong decrease

422
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,240
last year we saw five hundred seven

423
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,650
thousand total infections on the p2p

424
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,780
network but Peter pick roller and now

425
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,020
it's like less than three hundred twenty

426
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,370
thousand infections on the peer-to-peer

427
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,410
network so it's going down a lot now and

428
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,800
I think also partly because now they in

429
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,710
in those countries rather infected their

430
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,060
reinstalling or getting a new computer

431
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,780
and it's very interesting to see that

432
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,130
there are like a lot of active in fact

433
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,770
choose p2p infectious but only like SRS

434
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,200
and super nodes it's it's going to be

435
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,460
very interesting once all the super

436
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,710
nodes are gone they cannot communicate

437
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,260
with each other like all most of the

438
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,790
infections like 440 14000 they are

439
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,520
behind the net or behind the firewall so

440
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,050
you cannot from the outside you cannot

441
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,150
contact them but they can contact you if

442
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,300
you have your port open so once all the

443
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,100
super nodes are gone

444
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,420
the peer-to-peer network is kind of dead

445
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,990
and it might be interesting you know to

446
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,690
go after the super nodes to at least

447
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,100
disrupt the partly even though I

448
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,730
wouldn't recommend it so this is how the

449
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,370
URL how does yours look that are being

450
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,430
exchanged and it's they always put slash

451
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:47,240
logo dot chief or something else like

452
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,000
image dot gif or similar name so it's

453
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,730
very easy to find them if you just make

454
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,200
a Google search you will find tons of

455
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,420
them and that's how it looks as

456
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,580
basically this is just a file uploaded

457
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,960
this is just a binary file rc4

458
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,410
encryption

459
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,960
it and say we just download it and start

460
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,910
it

461
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,610
so we observed all these your l pecks on

462
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,210
our p2p Corolla and the newest one was

463
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,660
241 ad then it just just a week ago they

464
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,060
released updates ran at 50 so they

465
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,590
always changed the URLs to new ones

466
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:22,010
because they get taken down and Daniela

467
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:26,870
just push out new girls they're on the

468
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,960
network for there was no new update for

469
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,330
a long time on the peer-to-peer network

470
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,850
on regarding develop X it has right now

471
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,630
only two domains to your s listed one is

472
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,950
SL w OC FD which is not a valid domain

473
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,390
but you could use it in your network

474
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,310
because it will try to reach out there

475
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,200
so could use it locally to check if

476
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,910
there's any connection to that and it

477
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,370
means there's an infection and it also

478
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,080
goes to disappear dress but this one is

479
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,889
also not active anymore

480
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,080
there are some awkward interesting since

481
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,240
e remains that look like they wouldn't

482
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,610
be valid but they are like this very

483
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,700
long domain so the actual domain of it

484
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,420
is this part here and this is just a

485
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,860
subdomain part which which is weird and

486
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,630
interesting that they use it and as I

487
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,760
mentioned you there are some things you

488
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,320
can use to detect like the mutexes

489
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,560
locally and they like literally didn't

490
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,780
update the melo itself in the past few

491
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,690
years so when it downloads to

492
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:34,400
executables it will just decrypt them in

493
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,050
using 1024 byte blocks and just using RC

494
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,630
for using GD ID plus 30 ll it was

495
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,430
reported a few times by antivirus

496
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,650
researchers already still they didn't

497
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,050
care to change it maybe that's an

498
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,090
indication that they are that you don't

499
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,370
have to develop of it anymore but you

500
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,140
still use the botnet that could be the

501
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,020
case or they don't want to create any

502
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,610
noise they want to stay on the radar so

503
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,820
and by just you know encrypting it like

504
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,770
this you can push out and update so

505
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,050
anyone could do it so anyone could take

506
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,880
over potentially 2 million in fact

507
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,970
and served on payload they didn't secure

508
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:18,650
that this is then this is like other

509
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:19,970
encrypted file looks like in the

510
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,690
decrypted one and again yeah it's it's

511
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,500
it's just a simple file when I was

512
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,180
running it in my VM it was just doing up

513
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,180
a some spam so nothing really too

514
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,510
interesting the as I mentioned the

515
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:38,030
Woodkid is very simple um like a few

516
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,130
years ago it was very effective it's

517
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,430
only for 32-bit won't work on 64-bit

518
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:47,920
anymore and it was it has a list of

519
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,960
antivirus vendor strings and it was

520
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,430
checking the network packets if any of

521
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,100
those strings appear like if Kaspersky

522
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,210
appears and then it was dropping the

523
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,370
packet so if you would go to an

524
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,770
anti-virus website or if the antivirus

525
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,720
itself would try to update and it would

526
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,620
just drop all the packets of it and they

527
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,610
also you know killed the processes that

528
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:15,020
they found they did some others very

529
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,780
easy but effective things like there are

530
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,340
some rep there's a registry key where

531
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,700
you can basically say okay there's an

532
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,560
anti-virus installed so then the Windows

533
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,930
Defender won't show up and then windows

534
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,640
will not not will not tell you oh you

535
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,850
should install an anti-virus so they

536
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,630
were changing these values as well so

537
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,730
remediation moving it as mentioned it's

538
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,510
very simple just have to enable Windows

539
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,370
Update and that's it because Microsoft

540
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,870
added it to them malicious software

541
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,560
removal tool which will remove it so if

542
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,100
you just have you Windows Update and you

543
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,700
at least it will remove it afterwards

544
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,040
they released it in 2012 together with

545
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,640
another trojan and to do it on a global

546
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,180
level well tell everyone to enable

547
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,090
Windows Update to do it remotely you

548
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,560
could only go through the URL packs you

549
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,930
could like surf and update obviously law

550
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,600
enforcement will have to do it you could

551
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,029
try to disrupt the peer-to-peer botnets

552
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:23,669
it's fairly simple it appears to have a

553
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:25,769
value I could count value they they say

554
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:28,049
okay disappear i am i was always

555
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,209
communicating with this IP address so I

556
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:32,459
will continue communicate but there's

557
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:36,059
also way around that and as I mentioned

558
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,709
before if you take out the super nodes

559
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,469
that are accessible from the outside

560
00:24:39,469 --> 00:24:42,899
then you could take down the entire pot

561
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:47,569
net I wanted to do a live demo of the

562
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:51,389
p2p crawler but I figured it wouldn't be

563
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,369
the best idea to do it here from the

564
00:24:53,369 --> 00:24:56,549
Google IP addresses because they would

565
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:59,219
people like listed very fast if they if

566
00:24:59,219 --> 00:25:00,179
suddenly wanted hitters would

567
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,699
communicate with 300 thousand apiece

568
00:25:02,699 --> 00:25:05,159
that are all known to be bots so I'm

569
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,259
going to upload a video later and

570
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:09,889
showing how I'm doing it and I'm also

571
00:25:09,889 --> 00:25:12,439
wrote a paper about it and have also

572
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:15,209
some algorithms put in there and some

573
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:17,189
structures that are used for sending the

574
00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:20,369
p2p messages and I'm going to do that

575
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:20,969
yeah

576
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:24,109
initiative later so the conclusion of

577
00:25:24,109 --> 00:25:27,719
salad is that it's very simple a very

578
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:30,959
simple bot but very effective but I

579
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:33,449
think it like reached its time now

580
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,939
because at some point also in those

581
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:38,089
countries they will update their

582
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:42,059
operating system and then sanity will be

583
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:45,509
gone hopefully but they have very very

584
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:51,089
nasty nasty stuff and that's it thank

585
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:53,658
you for your attention

586
00:26:00,729 --> 00:26:07,749
questions any questions

587
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:19,740
hi Chris from crosswalk so in 2013 there

588
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,630
was a paper published Peter pwned at I

589
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,940
Triple E security and privacy outlining

590
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,990
the measuring the population of all the

591
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,960
peer-to-peer botnets out there and as

592
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,720
part of that research we measured about

593
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,080
900,000 peers or no IP addresses for a

594
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,260
facility now I don't really understand

595
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,150
what's your justification of claiming

596
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,440
that there might be four million

597
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,370
infections

598
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,500
what's allottee out there based on the

599
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,390
coverage of the URL packs so we don't

600
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,930
have all the URL packs if we go back a

601
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:59,310
few slides then we can see that right so

602
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,530
we only like have these URL hex and they

603
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:06,240
update them like every few weeks and if

604
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,990
there's like a machine and it's not

605
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,890
connecting to the internet that's it for

606
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,600
I don't know two three four weeks then

607
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,370
it might not be able to communicate with

608
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,930
the people to PA but not anymore because

609
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,490
the IP addresses they've changed already

610
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,030
or not in fact sounded active so it will

611
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,040
just stick to the one URL peg to the old

612
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,780
one and it will not update the URL peg

613
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,320
and so it's like not part of the p2p but

614
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,180
not anymore so it's still an active

615
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,160
infection just not communicating anymore

616
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,800
with the p2p partner and we only see

617
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,490
this URL packs and there are like many

618
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,550
missing so that's why I estimate that we

619
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:46,190
only see about half of it

620
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,280
and they're like also old versions

621
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,270
there's also some versions that I

622
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,820
couldn't sinkhole because other security

623
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:00,380
companies have them sing cold I might

624
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,760
I'm far smaller than there was a good

625
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,830
presentation Thank You um you've given

626
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,830
some hints that that vigilant a security

627
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,410
researcher could could take down and

628
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:10,640
perhaps they've tried to but I'm

629
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,400
wondering this sounds also interesting

630
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,780
for other cyber criminals I mean there's

631
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,070
a Bob Knight that's relatively easy to

632
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,320
take over have you seen any any activity

633
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,970
from other malware groups that think hey

634
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,340
I can have a few hundred thousand

635
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,799
machines in Egypt and Vietnam no I never

636
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,290
saw it because I think most criminals

637
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,450
don't realize that um the times where I

638
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,799
saw that they try to take over other

639
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,350
BOTS was only like four rats and smaller

640
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,960
stuff criminals doing something like on

641
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,549
this large-scale area like create your

642
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,950
own botnet they don't typically bother

643
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,419
about other pot nets they will not do

644
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:44,540
like research typically and no we

645
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,340
haven't seen any activity of anyone

646
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,260
trying to take it over and use it for

647
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,970
their own purpose I think you would

648
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,950
rather try to reach out to them and you

649
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,710
know tell them hey please run my bots on

650
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,530
yours and I'll pay you that's more

651
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:01,299
realistic scenario I think thanks

652
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:08,270
question were here first of all thanks

653
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,390
about especially about the remediation

654
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:14,690
notes do have any insights on on the

655
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,809
development process of sanity when was

656
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:22,880
the last version update was observed so

657
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,950
I believed like last version was in -

658
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,679
from 2011 it's old yeah it's old

659
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:37,429
why then what why do the last change was

660
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:38,960
just Network flow of the peer-to-peer

661
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,230
network yeah so it's like six six years

662
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:46,510
old yeah why didn't it still alive yeah

663
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,580
because no one really cares about it I

664
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,000
mean that's my next mission

665
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,679
probably the stupidest question of the

666
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,950
whole Kampf what bad does it do well it

667
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,269
corrupts your executables a lot of them

668
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:07,320
it tries to infect them so that sucks so

669
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,679
they kind of run up the debt and yeah

670
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,330
exactly yeah a lot of time that will

671
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,390
fail to run but also it at least the

672
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,710
early versions were stealing all the

673
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,990
logins locally and and sending it to the

674
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,210
attacker in the earliest version now

675
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,880
it's sending out spam and potentially

676
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,649
doing other stuff like stealing your

677
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:34,740
logins and okay okay thank you any other

678
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:41,100
questions no more questions

679
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,439
one two three okay thank you
