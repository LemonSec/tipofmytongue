1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:05,580
just just a few words i first met john

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,790
at conference on actually well

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,340
originally spam because a muggy was

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,650
mostly about spam at the beginning but

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,510
now they they talk about malware mobile

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,119
threats etc but it's a conference mostly

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,619
about email threat from the beginning

8
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,900
and actually it's quite an interesting

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,570
audience you have a lot of eyes peas a

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,640
lot of people are looking at spam and

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,370
it's if you if you don't know about

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,129
marga maybe a look at their conferences

13
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,180
or look at joining it can be interesting

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,129
to come from time to time to to their

15
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:48,750
conferences and john would like to share

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,309
his views on takedowns and maybe spark

17
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,309
discussions on the issue so you have the

18
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,730
flow job sir like so good news we're

19

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,480
i go over your still be on time for

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,210
pizza hopefully or if a lot of questions

22
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,270
are asked so my name is john.babinec i

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,740
work for a company of fidelis

24
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,590
cybersecurity I aspire that that is the

25
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,020
last time I say cyber and this

26
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,490
presentation but it's not my fault I

27
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,200
didn't name the company you know but I

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,080
do cash to pay checks so been in the

29
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,360
industry about 16 years I am also a

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,369
faculty member at the University of

31
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:29,310
Illinois and champaign-urbana teaching

32
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,759
some CS classes and produce some open

33
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,280
source intelligence feeds based on DGA

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,259
stuff which you can see there and I'm

35
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,790
assuming that several of you probably

36
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,960
already used and look at that so for

37
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,460
this talk kind of sharing restrictions

38
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,200
right this is all basically TLP green

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,490
it's streamed on the internet whatever

40
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,750
so everything I talk about is

41
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,880
essentially public there are some

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,470
private things that go into my

43
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,149
conclusions so if you want to ask me

44
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,219
about that because at certain points I'm

45
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:58,280
going to be intentionally oblique

46
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,259
because I had to remove some stuff from

47
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,479
this slides because they became law

48
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,240
enforcement issues a couple of days ago

49
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,829
so if i get oblique feel free to talk to

50
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,720
me later and i may may be able to

51
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,550
disclose more but for everything i say

52
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,440
up here tweet tweet away

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,000
you can make fun on me on Twitter I

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,390
don't care Peter so most of my talks I

55
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,370
begin with with you know this slide

56
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,840
right the problem statement and we all

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,180
kind of know this right is that you know

58
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,800
we're kind of on the losing losing end

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,420
of an arms race you know with malware

60
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,400
and botnets and the whole whole security

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,860
space right everything that we do you

62
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,630
know is in public right because they can

63
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,970
buy our products you know virustotal 57

64
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,400
antivirus engines they can pre generate

65
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,810
all their malware to make sure it's

66
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,430
clean you know everything they do is

67
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,470
private takes us a lot of work to get

68
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,930
around the reason that's relevant for

69
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,550
this particular presentation is this

70
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,840
kind of goes into my philosophy of

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,150
takedowns is that the economics and the

72
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,660
status quo favors the criminals and I

73
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,000
generally focus exclusively on criminal

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,100
threats because eventually you know

75
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,390
occasionally we can put somebody in jail

76
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,850
I can't really solve the Intelligence

77
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,440
Agency problem people have been spying

78
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,540
on other nations for other years so you

79
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,980
know the short version of this is we're

80
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,750
all doomed but everybody in this room is

81
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,760
going to be working forever even if your

82
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,320
cereal screw up because we know cereal

83
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,580
screw-ups in our industry and they still

84
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,320
get paid right there's more work than

85
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,760
anybody could ever do in their lifetime

86
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,560
so you know I'm limited job security

87
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,250
right that's good news you know another

88
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,959
another way of putting it right from the

89
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,670
onion you know China can't keep up with

90
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,709
hiring enough hackers to hack us stuff

91
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:33,810
kind of an American centric slide but

92
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,700
you but it amuses me and hopefully you

93
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,260
know some of this is humor because last

94
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,940
talk of the day so hopefully hopefully

95
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,570
lighting it up a little bit so my kind

96
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,980
of general approach to taking things

97
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,900
down right you know I'm kind of a

98
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,640
belligerent Irishman bamboo neck make

99
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,140
you know confuse you it's not really an

100
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,300
Irish name you know it's kind of Ellis

101
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,910
Island polish but I am half Irish and if

102
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,739
I'm not breaking things on board and if

103
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,209
you talk to my wife when I'm bored then

104
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,700
I get into trouble you know so she tries

105
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,989
to you know have me do chores or

106
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:02,940
something just to keep me from but you

107
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,470
know causing problems for myself I

108
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,780
generally like just breaking and

109
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,610
smashing things right you know that's

110
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,590
kind of my mindset that's not

111
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,989
everybody's mindset that's cool subject

112
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,280
of debate much i'm sure we'll come up

113
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,760
with or we'll get to soon what does it

114
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,620
take down I'm sure everybody here knows

115
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,680
what it is but briefly right you know

116
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,090
you know is it a marketing ploy in some

117
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,710
cases takedowns have been marketing

118
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,450
ploys right

119
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,460
you know but it's treated as something

120
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,620
that's distinct a distinct and special

121
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,660
action that stands alone I argue that

122
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,100
it's not and we'll get there in a second

123
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,370
you know just you know about 30 minutes

124
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,360
ago I read about a law enforcement

125
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,140
operation generally us-based of just

126
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,000
taking down thirty thousand some odd

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,040
counterfeit good shopping sites over

128
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,380
over the shopping American holidays of

129
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,340
black friday and and the ongoing rampant

130
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,990
commercialism that we make Christmas in

131
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,090
the United States right you know it's

132
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,470
it's fishing right that's a takedown

133
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,480
people do that all the time but when you

134
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,010
talk about botnets it gets to be more

135
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,770
controversial right you know getting a

136
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,120
hosting company to clean up their

137
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,310
network is that a takedown right there's

138
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,830
a specific case on angler that we'll

139
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,290
talk about as we go my definition right

140
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,760
you know I get to define my terms

141
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,380
because i've got a microphone right so

142
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,730
you know that way i can make sure i

143
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,310
define it this to already align with my

144
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,160
predefined conclusions you know it's

145
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,110
some kind of disruptive action to

146
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,180
achieve you know some objective right it

147
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,340
is objective focused there is some

148
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,320
intent a side of i want to blow stuff up

149
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,910
for the sake of blowing stuff up right

150
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,770
you know we can all blow stuff up that's

151
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,440
cool but try to achieve some objective

152
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,480
and ideally that objective will not be

153
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,310
having a takedown okay why do them okay

154
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,200
i work for a security vendor now

155
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,420
previously to that I guess my company

156
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,400
still exists but I was independent for a

157
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,740
long time you know but generally we've

158
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,950
all got clients you know and most for

159
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,720
the most part like our products you know

160
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,000
we don't increase our bottom line you

161
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,970
know by doing takedowns you know it's

162
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,210
good media which is both good and bad

163
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,650
it's part of the problem of takedowns

164
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,050
right you know but we're paid to protect

165
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,330
our customers and generally speaking

166
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,600
taking things down you know can lead to

167
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,880
a chain of events that have adversaries

168
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,620
move around our ability to detect them

169
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,290
right so it's counterintuitive that

170
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,440
being said you know my sense of new of

171
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,240
altruism kicks in is that for the most

172
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,860
part the people who most need protection

173
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,090
is certainly when you're talking about

174
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,250
crime are not necessarily buying our

175
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,320
products they're not enterprises you

176
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,550
know no one's going to spend a hundred

177
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,920
thousand dollars for my company's box to

178
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,870
protect their house that would be silly

179
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,670
right you know but these are the

180
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,100
people getting robbed every day so kind

181
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,810
of my sister my sense of you know

182
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,000
building a better society and I won't

183
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,500
say cyberspace because i don't want

184
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,260
Peter making me drink you know is is

185
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,420
helping those people that aren't

186
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,280
protected by our technologies which

187
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,960
means we have to do something else has

188
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,940
to be disruptions arrest so and so forth

189
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,630
okay so the general debate right of

190
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,910
whether or not to do takedowns right you

191
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,280
know attackers will adapt so you know

192
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,040
they move around our ability to detect

193
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,990
them you know takedowns are ineffective

194
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,660
do more harm than good and the question

195
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,640
of whether law enforcement should be

196
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:24,770
involved we'll go through each ok so the

197
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,080
the question of adaption of adversaries

198
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,460
right you know and this is kind of a

199
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,740
philosophical point right everything we

200
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,540
do is public and they adapt to

201
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,520
everything we do every time we create a

202
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,850
new rule AV signature blacklist whatever

203
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,430
you know they adapt to it because

204
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,230
everything we do is disrupt it that's

205
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,640
what we're paid to do we're paid to

206
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,860
block them from infecting our clients

207
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,900
and they will adapt around that as much

208
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,240
as possible right so whether it's a vs

209
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,030
firewalls blacklists for instance in the

210
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,370
example with djs for those who look at

211
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,950
me or use my DGA feeds right I just

212
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,290
enumerate the entire list of a DGA of

213
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,850
domains resolve all of its stripout

214
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,290
sinkholes here you go here's an

215
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,630
intelligence list not an operations list

216
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,280
don't put it into a firewall but an

217
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,740
intelligence list you know an attackers

218
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,090
know that I do this because it's a

219
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,890
public resource and every now and then

220
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,630
they know their dj's they'll just have

221
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,850
their dge I'll buy a domain and point it

222
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:17,840
to something else not their

223
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,470
infrastructure for instance 888 right in

224
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,260
an attempt to troll us or break things

225
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,210
right they're really clever they would

226
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,310
have used the DNS root servers you know

227
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,380
which really would break things because

228
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,090
people do despite me telling them not to

229
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,710
take those IP lists and put them into a

230
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,990
firewall you know but the point is is

231
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,090
they observe what we're doing right you

232
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,470
know and they adapt and it doesn't

233
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,679
matter how much impact there is right

234
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,090
you know now in terms of the entire

235
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,560
spectrum of disruptive activities

236
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,080
takedown certainly is on the more

237
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,940
extreme end but certainly not the most

238
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,970
extreme you know arrests obviously being

239
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,320
an extreme form of disrupt

240
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,870
you know I suppose Predator drones and

241
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,460
just blowing stuff up would be probably

242
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,710
the farthest out there but short of

243
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,030
immunity I'm not going to be in that

244
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,460
business you know somebody here can give

245
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,080
me immunity and Predator drones let's

246
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,750
have that conversation you know but you

247
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,240
know it's just a form of many types of

248
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,490
disruptions that we already do right so

249
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,810
there are you know the question is all

250
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,430
they'll adapt and whatever they adapt

251
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,420
anyway ineffective right certainly we

252
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,610
can all go through lists of of takedowns

253
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,450
that have been ineffective in the past

254
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,740
we'll go through some case studies and

255
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,170
some- case studies to show that but just

256
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,000
because you know somebody's an idiot who

257
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,140
doesn't know what they're doing and just

258
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,550
kind of randomly shooting at things

259
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,410
doesn't mean that more thoughtful

260
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,320
approaches to doing this work won't

261
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,840
yield fruit right and certainly there's

262
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,760
been a couple of times there's been very

263
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,040
much a great deal of collateral damage

264
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,230
in one case in particular we'll talk

265
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,150
about that but that being said there

266
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,000
have been successes you know conficker

267
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,350
you know Zeus cryptolocker with

268
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,420
operation tovar ram net not going to

269
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,000
talk about to a great deal dried X to an

270
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,500
extent not going to talk about that but

271
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,200
there was an arrest for that and arrest

272
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,770
or good things I like people in jail you

273
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,450
know I can't put them there but the more

274
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,980
that they go there the happier that

275
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,370
makes me right cuz you know that's just

276
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,830
me so doing more harm than good right

277
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,870
you know and part of that you know its

278
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,190
adoption but part of that could be you

279
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,010
know questions of collateral damage you

280
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,370
know so i guess the example I'm going to

281
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,260
use his no IP and that takedown right

282
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,850
you know where there was a whole lot of

283
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,040
collateral damage based on I want to say

284
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,290
it was fifteen twenty thousand hostnames

285
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,690
that wanted to be seized and basically

286
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,970
blew up an entire company and the

287
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,130
millions of customers that they have you

288
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,570
know okay that was kind of a bad thing

289
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,480
right but it's important to keep in mind

290
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,100
of the consequences you know of her

291
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,450
behavior right not doing things

292
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,190
thoughtlessly but having an objective in

293
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,770
mind right so two quick examples right

294
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,630
you know with configure there was some

295
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,190
delay and I don't know if anybody here

296
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,420
was part of the conflict or working

297
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,940
group I wasn't but you know there's some

298
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,680
delay because a lot of configure

299
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,930
machines were medical equipment so what

300
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,970
happens if we disrupt situ

301
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,010
communications to

302
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,960
medical device infected with conficker

303
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,130
because at a certain point now you're

304
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,600
talking life safety potential life

305
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,490
safety issues and that had to be

306
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,840
examined and dealt with to make sure

307
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,120
that you know somebody's pacemaker or

308
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,280
the life-support system just didn't stop

309
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,170
working because people dying would be a

310
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,240
bad thing at least good innocent people

311
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,170
dying would be a bad thing the other

312
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,570
example is ransomware and I'll using the

313
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,190
case for cryptolocker we'll talk more in

314
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,200
a little bit detail about that in a few

315
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,790
minutes but one of the things that

316
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,550
slowed us down you know in terms of of

317
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,810
taking it down we could have took it

318
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,000
down fairly quickly and early on we had

319
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,010
the capability of doing it but the

320
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,210
question was you know what there's a lot

321
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,800
of people who didn't pay ransom and had

322
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,080
their files encrypted if we take down

323
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,370
their infrastructure and just shoot it

324
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,960
in the head they're never going to get

325
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,330
their files back you know we knew there

326
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,010
was a server out there that had the

327
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,390
private keys and eventually you know

328
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,490
that server was retrieved and the

329
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,830
service was created you know but that

330
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,270
would have been an example you know of

331
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,710
collateral damage okay yeah we did a

332
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,360
takedown but all those files that got

333
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,840
encrypted sorry homie you're out of luck

334
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,370
not an ideal response like I said in

335
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,500
some cases that maybe you know where you

336
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,450
end up you know but there's a weighing

337
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,780
involved and law enforcement being

338
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,760
involved right you know and my first

339
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,890
question is defined involved all right

340
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,130
you know there is obviously the best

341
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,320
outcome you know that we can get is

342
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,810
arrests and not just a rest of like some

343
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,330
money mule or some you know affiliate or

344
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,520
low-level person arresting you know the

345
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,870
top of the food chain and all the people

346
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,380
right you know that's the ideal we're

347
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,640
not always going to get to the ideal

348
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,470
because of jurisdictional issues and all

349
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,150
sorts of sorts of other things that we

350
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,040
already aware of right you know if there

351
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,770
is an actor in inside the Russian

352
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,420
Federation unless I can get the FSB

353
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,460
motivated you know there's not going to

354
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,110
be an arrest certainly if there's no

355
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,510
Russian victims and the only time I've

356
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,250
ever gotten Russian law enforcement

357
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,140
excited and working on something that I

358
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,240
reported to was because it involved a

359
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,150
Chechen right then they were then

360
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,500
they're like yeah give us everything

361
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,240
will take care of this but short of that

362
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,490
they've that they'll take things quietly

363
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,050
but you know just kind of into the bit

364
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,550
bucket I don't know to what extent

365
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,110
agency is legal doctrine outside of the

366
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,270
United States right but at a certain

367
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:20,760
point

368
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,720
in US legal doctrine you know there's

369
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,670
being an agent of the government right

370
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,760
if I am if I were to be tasked by the

371
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,760
FBI hey FBI says hey John go do this

372
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,830
then there's a question am I government

373
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,200
actor an individual actor and it comes

374
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,960
it brings into all sorts of liability

375
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,150
issues that I'd rather that most people

376
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,380
in the private sector don't want to deal

377
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,030
with and I don't know what to what

378
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,440
extent and I get the impression that

379
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,360
that's probably mostly a u.s. problem

380
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,370
right but at a certain point saying you

381
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,080
know what I'm being an agent of the

382
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,640
federal government creates a lot

383
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,380
problems and it adopts a lot of

384
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,390
liability that private actor actors

385
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,400
ought not to be adopting in the first

386
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:06,420
place so let's see get in law

387
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,310
enforcement involved I said the rolls

388
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,800
around one issue right and there may not

389
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,540
be open cases there may not but that one

390
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,610
issue is you know if I want to call Eric

391
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,230
and say hey there's something I want to

392
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,210
take you look at his first question and

393
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,710
feel free to tell me if I'm wrong is are

394
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,680
there any French citizens impacted all

395
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,080
right you know I pay taxes to my

396
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,700
government you guys pay taxes to your

397
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,020
respective government and generally

398
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,910
speaking we pay for law enforcement to

399
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,460
protect our citizens global economy

400
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,130
global you know internet right but still

401
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,700
nation based law enforcement so in order

402
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,800
to get that information you know

403
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,720
sometimes I have to take down some piece

404
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,220
of something to say hey you know what

405
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,590
there's 50,000 French citizens infected

406
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,380
you know of this banking Trojan okay you

407
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,000
know and now now I've got some damage

408
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,250
now I can say hey this law enforcement

409
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,420
agency should take a look at something

410
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,330
right so sometimes you have to act and

411
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,550
have some of these partial you know

412
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,080
partial disruptions just to get the

413
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,250
information to really get the law

414
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:07,350
enforcement and started my personal

415
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,330
approach you know in terms of what I do

416
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,640
is that generally speaking when I start

417
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,740
to get to where I'm getting operational

418
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,330
on something i'll certainly talk to law

419
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,300
enforcement to find an open case right

420
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,920
you know I work pretty closely with the

421
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,900
FBI citizen the US right that's

422
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,150
relatively easy you know but it gets

423
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,190
interesting you know when i'm starting

424
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,890
to deal with foreign law enforcement you

425
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:29,940
know part of the reason i've been

426
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,350
traveling you know about half the time

427
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,060
this year is meeting with law

428
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,630
enforcement just so I you know when I

429
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,190
on the phone hey I know that guy he's a

430
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,480
good guy okay we'll have a conversation

431
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,540
because you know otherwise why is this

432
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,080
American calling you know the law

433
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,790
enforcement in Bucharest you know what

434
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,610
do I care what he has to say right and

435
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,470
he's asking about an open case right

436
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,280
probably a conversation that hopefully

437
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,050
says you know this might be intelligence

438
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,250
gathering we ought not to have this

439
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,820
conversation you know but being able to

440
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,070
have you know an idea if there's an open

441
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,380
case and say hey listen I'm going to go

442
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,930
after something I don't want to blow up

443
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,150
any criminal cases right if I don't know

444
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,040
if I don't know that they're looking at

445
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,270
something and I just kind of kick over

446
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,760
the hornet's nest can wreck evidence do

447
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,560
all sorts of things right you know so

448
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,330
I'll at least say hey it's an open case

449
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,300
if so approach it more as a law

450
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,980
enforcement problem that will not

451
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,780
necessarily stop me from doing something

452
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,240
if if there isn't right you know if

453
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,680
there's no law enforcement interest for

454
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,780
whatever reason okay well you know then

455
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,010
it's fair game for me to use it as a

456
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,550
personal personal chew toy so you know

457
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,230
you know that's it I'll work with law

458
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,270
enforcement almost anywhere to take

459
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,650
something down and blow something up but

460
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,750
you know whatever I can do to put more

461
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,320
people in jail makes me a happy person

462
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,760
alright in our last point you know

463
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,490
takedowns as marketing ploys right it's

464
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,530
kind of a notorious problem you know

465
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,570
with security vendors who engage in

466
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,120
actions and activities that really are

467
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,400
nothing more than self-promotion and

468
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,620
certainly takedowns have been used that

469
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,540
way in the past but certainly not the

470
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,150
only way self-promotion happens in ways

471
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,359
that are obtrusive and obnoxious right

472
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,910
you know and just we as an industry need

473
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,849
to stop that behavior and stop letting

474
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:18,760
marketing define what we do and use

475
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,199
marketing as a tool to whatever get

476
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:21,520
something done yeah we gotta sell

477
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,560
product great you know but marketing

478
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,209
shouldn't say hey you know what I want

479
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:27,430
you to go blow up a botnet so we can go

480
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:34,620
get on CNN you know no get out here so

481
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,670
objectives right you know part of my

482
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,960
definition right you're trying to

483
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,870
achieve some cognitive you know

484
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,280
cognizant objective that you want to

485
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,680
accomplish by a takedown ideally not a

486
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,000
takedown for the sake of a takedown

487
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,770
because that's kind of silly you want to

488
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,370
do some

489
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,440
thing right you know it might be a

490
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,080
remediation a full remediation of a

491
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,550
threat victim notification the whole

492
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,059
yards you know certainly as part of

493
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:01,720
arrest you know somebody was arrested

494
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,570
got the head actor ok now let's

495
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,400
decapitate everything and then you know

496
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,130
start cleaning up after it you know but

497
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,010
having some objective right and some of

498
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,600
those outcomes you know that you may

499
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,070
have in mind some objectives may not

500
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,050
lead to you know take down being your

501
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,900
first choice right so knowing what you

502
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,480
actually want to accomplish versus you

503
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,070
know I woke up i'm in a bad mood you

504
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,720
know didn't get a good night's sleep my

505
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,070
kids kept me up i'm gonna go blow up a

506
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:31,570
botnet sure why not right ok you know

507
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,700
there's probably more you know creative

508
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,300
ways and constructive ways as to use

509
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,600
adversarial actors as a chew toy so case

510
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,250
studies right the first i mentioned

511
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,250
already there's no IP right so many

512
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,260
campaigns shouldn't be a surprise to

513
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,540
anybody in here you know are using

514
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:53,140
dynamic dns specifically no IP certainly

515
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,140
at the time we're using no IP for you

516
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,320
know dns services right i want to say

517
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,970
just based on my current data I think

518
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,470
sixty-five percent the stuff says

519
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,840
dynamic dns is still using the IP vital

520
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,870
works when Microsoft did essentially

521
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:12,429
they went to court and said hey here's X

522
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:14,320
number of domains all hosted by this

523
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,390
company they're providing service for a

524
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,809
criminal enterprise they stated that

525
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:22,450
there was no plausible way to work with

526
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,160
this company to deal with this problem

527
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,710
so give us control of their name servers

528
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,140
so we can clean up their dns space for

529
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,590
them you know and I said hilarity did

530
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,750
not into because things blew up for a

531
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,490
while and and it was kind of a bad day

532
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,120
for all involved okay Microsoft took

533
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,100
over third-party infrastructure that

534
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,480
they were unprepared to manage right so

535
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,160
certainly an excessive step for what

536
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,020
they were trying to do but you know

537
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,370
there is a certain subset of takedowns

538
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,110
where you know I'm going to take over

539
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,390
and operate the infrastructure you know

540
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,280
if you don't know what you're doing

541
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,260
things can fail and spectacular in

542
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,480
horrific ways especially when talking

543
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,210
about something

544
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,560
dns so you know this happened okay

545
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,300
ideally only supposed to target I want

546
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,920
to say it was ten to 20,000 I think 15

547
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,660
thousands name comes to mind and I

548
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,550
couldn't find the pleadings off the top

549
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,830
of my are with a search you know but

550
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,510
ultimately right you know there's a lot

551
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,790
of damage to all involved you know and

552
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,920
Microsoft looked quite poor and rightly

553
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,630
so because it really was a bad move on

554
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,240
their part the other thing that it led

555
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,720
to is not quite in earnest you know but

556
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,030
a little bit there now other dynamic dns

557
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,320
providers out there and there's some

558
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,960
open source tools we can kind of fire up

559
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,790
a shared server somewhere and start

560
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,130
being your own dynamic dns provider so

561
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,620
now instead of you know having one

562
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,390
general place to go now it can kind of

563
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,740
be anywhere and there's some kind of you

564
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,950
know kind of diffusion of dynamic dns

565
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,770
service that probably will provide some

566
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,720
complications going forward not quite

567
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,290
yet but getting there okay other things

568
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,360
done wrong right no real cooperation

569
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,010
with outside entities microsoft just

570
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,300
kind of did this on their own as far as

571
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,760
they did you know no apparent risk

572
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,380
assessment nobody really wants to talk

573
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,090
between those two entities about what

574
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,800
really happened but you know from the

575
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,230
cheap seats right nobody said what

576
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,300
happens if we can't manage those

577
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,760
nameservers you know because you know

578
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,470
what did happen is that everything broke

579
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,080
you know for millions of people and that

580
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,230
was kind of a bad day you know and i

581
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,790
said the key point is there you know is

582
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,890
that they tried to take over third-party

583
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,690
infrastructure that they didn't really

584
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,670
know how to manage which is a bad day

585
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,090
right and I said sometimes there's a

586
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,600
place for running you know actually

587
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,710
operating you know malicious

588
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,390
infrastructure probably not over the

589
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,680
long term because his legal issues

590
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,420
involved with that you know but there

591
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,190
have been certain certain takedowns

592
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,170
where you know we're going to sit there

593
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,220
and take over the malicious

594
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,510
infrastructure to gather more

595
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,010
intelligence for a defined period of

596
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,480
time and if you don't know what you're

597
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,280
doing things can break and spectacular

598
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,000
in horrific ways second case study is

599
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,140
conficker right

600
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,460
this the other end of the spectrum of

601
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,980
contrast right huge group involved the

602
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,870
people all over the world you know

603
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,919
ultimately involve I analyst a 150 gTLDs

604
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,139
you know sir registrar's all over the

605
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:18,720
place of trying to do this is strictly

606
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,730
DNS based only so they were able to do a

607
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,659
strict you know domain domain seizure to

608
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:25,860
grab all the infrastructure and there

609
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,169
you go right you know in contrary to

610
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:33,090
know IP the adversarial control of the

611
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,159
infrastructure you know was taken over

612
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,950
and no one was after the operation was

613
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,869
launched you know the adversary was not

614
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:41,970
able to reassert control right so

615
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,499
conficker still dead and gone for

616
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:45,110
instance even though there's what

617
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,600
600,000 ip's give or take they're still

618
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,509
infected with conficker right you know

619
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:54,049
there were some arrests that occurred

620
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:56,970
and and from the public reporting like I

621
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,769
said you know the FBI hinted that

622
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:00,960
conficker was part of the reason but

623
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,749
never explicitly stated so you know some

624
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,820
tan gentle connection right but nothing

625
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,769
ever publicly said you know what we got

626
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:09,240
the guy who organized it put it together

627
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,519
put him in jail right did decapitate it

628
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,909
no longer a threat right but you know it

629
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:16,350
doesn't look like the primary actors

630
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,399
were arrested okay third case study

631
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,230
Kelly Oakes pick one there's been four

632
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,269
different takedowns to date as far as I

633
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:28,679
know you know so one happened to be on

634
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:31,379
stage I want to say a black hat three

635
00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:33,720
years ago I forget exactly one you know

636
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,629
and that particular one I want to say

637
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:40,230
they were back to full strength not

638
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,820
quite by the end of the talk but pretty

639
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,029
close right so yeah you got to sit there

640
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:47,039
and look at the graphs and go ooh you

641
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,629
know in the press said yay look at this

642
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:51,480
right you know and I don't necessarily

643
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,860
want to impugn the motives of the people

644
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,450
involved but it's really hard to see any

645
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,850
value in what that did a side of hey you

646
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,289
gave a talk at black hat and got the

647
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:00,240
media to talk about it you know

648
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,460
congratulations good for you right you

649
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,749
know I get the media talk about anything

650
00:24:03,749 --> 00:24:05,429
at black hat by submitting a fake talk

651
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:07,649
and canceling it two weeks prior saying

652
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:09,330
and intelligence agency told me I can't

653
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,279
talk about it right because that happens

654
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,559
every year you know

655
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,139
it's true right it's programmatic at

656
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:20,470
this point this one generally involved

657
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,629
like peer-to-peer poison like so Kelly

658
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,700
Oakes in part you know as peer to peer

659
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,519
based so you know if you break down that

660
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:30,460
part of its ability to communicate you

661
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,649
know they're you know they can't talk to

662
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:35,919
each other not otherwise operate I said

663
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,240
the objective appeared for the takedown

664
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,740
for the sake of a takedown I mean if

665
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,360
you're doing it in front of a live

666
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,870
audience you know probably you know you

667
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,269
probably don't have the best intentions

668
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:48,159
right but it doesn't look like the

669
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,289
alternative channels for the adversary

670
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:52,389
to control it we're fully investigated

671
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:55,299
something that I'm working on now and

672
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:57,460
we're still finding new ways that the

673
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,869
adversary kind of controls the

674
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:01,779
infrastructure so the big point there is

675
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:02,950
I mean if you're going to do a takedown

676
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,200
I mean a site of a targeted thing for

677
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,570
telemetry or some other you know

678
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,990
non-fatal takedown is enumerated all the

679
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,730
passive communication so for instance

680
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,330
dire you've got a DGA you've got some

681
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,690
static lists and I I think it's tore at

682
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,549
one point it was I to pee right so

683
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:23,200
you've got to be able to go after all of

684
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,669
those channels to do a takedown of the

685
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:25,960
attackers just going to reassert a

686
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,879
control of the infrastructure and you've

687
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:30,159
just wasted everybody's time for no good

688
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,549
reason okay you know and generally those

689
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:35,230
approaches were were more of the go it

690
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:39,789
alone go to loan route this one I was

691
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:42,539
part of with operation tovar

692
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,830
specifically the cryptolocker piece of

693
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,080
it gameover zeus did right along with it

694
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,169
so as an idea of what kind of you know

695
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:52,840
coordination went into it 14 different

696
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,869
national law enforcement agencies just a

697
00:25:55,869 --> 00:25:58,029
cryptolocker working group was about 150

698
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:00,580
people all over the place you know

699
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,759
there's Russia to us China there's a

700
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,519
bunch of people all over involved in it

701
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,249
generally appeared August August of 2013

702
00:26:09,249 --> 00:26:12,220
by about October I was in a position

703
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,230
where I could have killed it if I wanted

704
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,779
to they really only had one mean of

705
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:19,119
communication that was a DGA it's

706
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,070
ransomware so not exactly a bot but had

707
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,679
bought like communication structures so

708
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,020
I could have nuked it in October

709
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,430
you know the big thing that was on our

710
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:30,340
minds was you know hey you know is

711
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,700
restoring recovered files you know but

712
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,160
there was also another piece of it that

713
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,360
really delayed us and that was its

714
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,800
connection to GAMEOVER Zeus which

715
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,900
despite ransomware and cryptolocker

716
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,060
being a big thing in my mind at least

717
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,770
GAMEOVER Zeus was a bigger threat you

718
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,450
know the dollars are bigger you know on

719
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,860
however you measure these things

720
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,350
certainly the dollar amounts for game

721
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,570
will resume are bigger so we ended up

722
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,820
deferring deferring for that for about

723
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:01,180
six months kind of my my approach a

724
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,650
thing like that airing on recovery

725
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,500
recovery of files and we did eventually

726
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,170
recover that server we knew that we were

727
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,940
going to have it you know at a certain

728
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,700
point relatively early on you know but

729
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,990
we wanted to make sure that we can get

730
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,000
it and then produce a service and and a

731
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,350
couple of companies were involved in

732
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,420
that so that people could recover the

733
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,460
files you know another aspect of that

734
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,350
there is there was things that we kind

735
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,150
of spit around and within a smaller

736
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,400
subset of people is like you know what

737
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,900
other creative ways can we take things

738
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,420
down take this down and actual at one

739
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,250
point we're talking about you know we

740
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,230
could do sis you know the remote servers

741
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,720
got to generate keys so there's disk

742
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,640
space there's computational space this

743
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,980
is this is a good deed or target I mean

744
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,080
it would kind of be a felony to do it

745
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,490
but you know I'm sure somebody would

746
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,740
sign off on it baby you know but again

747
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,320
same problem you know yeah new

748
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,580
infections wouldn't happen if I

749
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,230
successfully deed all set server and

750
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,540
maintain it over the long term you know

751
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,430
but people wouldn't be able to buy and

752
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,080
get their files back you know they'd

753
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,540
send bitcoins to these people expecting

754
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,980
their money to their files to be

755
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,590
decrypted you know but there'd be

756
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,150
nothing for them to reach out to because

757
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,310
the server was down so that's something

758
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:13,060
that ultimately we shied away from okay

759
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,390
so I view this as a success qualified

760
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,950
success right the two threats are dead

761
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,990
and gone never been heard from again you

762
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,200
know the actor involved you know one of

763
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,490
them has a three million dollar bounty

764
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,860
on his head is a Russian citizen right

765
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,270
you know an indictment is only good

766
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,010
until you get an arrest you know but

767
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,170
he's not going anywhere I don't know if

768
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,390
he's married or not so if he is then if

769
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,950
a wife wants to go to Cyprus and maybe

770
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,870
we got a shot but short of that you know

771
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,670
all it is just a three-million-dollar

772
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,580
okay the one thing I also did want to

773
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,440
point out about this is that there was

774
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,540
some private sector to private sector

775
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:50,920
cooperation with Russia and China we

776
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,600
really can't craft a court order to get

777
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,640
somebody in China to do something you

778
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,120
know but Nick dot are you was you know

779
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,440
cooperating said ok we'll do six months

780
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,990
of domains if memory serves I was also

781
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,210
able to do targeted takedowns of Chinese

782
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:07,090
domains of a registrar that was at that

783
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,370
time at least perceived to be kind of

784
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,120
the Registrar of choice for Chinese ABT

785
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,460
and they were cooperative simply by

786
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,830
saying here's a threat whatever so that

787
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,210
is one thing like said the private

788
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,220
sector can do I mean the government of

789
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,280
the US and Russia and China and in mix

790
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,480
and match all the international

791
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,040
relations problems when governments try

792
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,170
to get something done you know when they

793
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,300
do it's great sometimes they can't but

794
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,370
private entities in those countries that

795
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:36,010
are you know unfriendly or uncooperative

796
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,620
jurisdictions you know with with Western

797
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,480
interests private sector people can

798
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,100
still get things done right within

799
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,960
certain limits obviously they've got

800
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,910
their laws we've got our laws but

801
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,920
certainly you know we can still do

802
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,500
things and disrupt threats you know in

803
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,510
the lack of you know effective

804
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,670
international cooperation right and

805
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,410
that's changing to a degree to what

806
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,360
extent and how fast that changes in

807
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,730
terms of international cooperation on on

808
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:03,940
criminal issues remains to be seen right

809
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,960
oh one last point the other piece of

810
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,610
this which is more something the NCAA

811
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,620
did and I don't know how much it really

812
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,240
penetrated in the US and other places

813
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,280
right it said okay you know here's the

814
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,900
tool you can check if you're infected in

815
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,580
an attempt to kind of raise public

816
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,140
awareness not just to these threats

817
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,340
though certainly it did for these

818
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,650
threats you know but getting to the

819
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,870
point where hey maybe we can teach the

820
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,910
consumer a thing or two using the media

821
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,060
cycle you know of a takedown to do that

822
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,610
right teaching individuals outside I

823
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,350
mean teaching security awareness even in

824
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,270
enterprises is kind of a touchy touch

825
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,100
and go kind of thing doing security

826
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,680
awareness of society writ large good

827
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,990
luck who's responsible for that you know

828
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,550
but if you're going to do a takedown and

829
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,110
there's probably going to be media

830
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,360
involved right why not use that

831
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,240
opportunity to teach people something so

832
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,440
that they're not victims

833
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,509
thing else right I mean most criminal

834
00:30:55,509 --> 00:30:57,700
threats you know I mean they're they're

835
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,350
higher end ones but there's lots of low

836
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,480
ground low-rent ones that work still

837
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,940
because people don't have a basic idea

838
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,220
of how to keep themselves safe and using

839
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,870
these opportunities to teach them a

840
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,759
couple of things is certainly something

841
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:11,019
that we should be doing we should be

842
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:16,179
doing better off alien spy and I have

843
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:17,830
take down in quotes because this is kind

844
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,779
of an unintentional take down on my part

845
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:23,200
alien spy is part of a long strain of

846
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,009
java-based rats you know currently known

847
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:30,399
as Jay socket you know so at this point

848
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,129
it was alien spy did a big report on it

849
00:31:33,129 --> 00:31:36,759
yay you know got a blog post out of it

850
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:38,620
and that made marketing happy you know

851
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,289
but a technical aspect of this is that

852
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:43,269
all builders it's a commercial based rat

853
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:44,769
service so you've got to buy a

854
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:47,409
time-based subscription and you get you

855
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:49,000
know the Builder which is a jar file

856
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
also and that builder which also doubles

857
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,279
as a command and control server calls

858
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,440
that calls home to verify subscription

859
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,600
status this actor wants to make sure

860
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,070
that he gets paid and he's still getting

861
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,070
paid you know so you know that

862
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,750
communication has to happen or the

863
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,730
Builder doesn't work and if the Builder

864
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,350
doesn't work you don't have access to

865
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:11,470
control any of your victims ok so we

866
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,169
published a report I wasn't precisely

867
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:15,820
clear on what to do with the information

868
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,490
and somebody of their own volition nuke

869
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,799
daily and spy net which was a purely

870
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,929
criminal domain and so is Jay socket org

871
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:25,210
nothing legitimate about it take a look

872
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,129
you know there's nothing legitimate

873
00:32:27,129 --> 00:32:28,870
suspend the domain seems like a valid

874
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:32,620
course of action right you know but that

875
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,210
kind of led to a chain of events and

876
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,950
actually I was in the middle of trying

877
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:38,230
to research the mobile malware piece of

878
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,990
it and then everything broke so the kind

879
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,909
of an accidental and unintentional thing

880
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:45,129
which which I won't say led to more

881
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,049
problems but simply they just burn the

882
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:49,480
alien spy name you know start a call no

883
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,840
sausage a socket registered a new domain

884
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,179
you know and then start a push and more

885
00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:59,470
product so lessen their of you know

886
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,000
being clear what to do with some of the

887
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,679
data that that many of us share on some

888
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:06,190
of these private lists you know but

889
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,509
that said the interesting thing about

890
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:09,940
that is is exposed kind of a consequence

891
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,070
of the actors design choices that namely

892
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,720
is so I said used to spend the domain

893
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,970
and then he's got to communicate all of

894
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:18,159
those customers hey download this you

895
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,899
know they probably lost all their

896
00:33:19,899 --> 00:33:21,460
victims maybe they can reassert their

897
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,610
victims reassert control over the victim

898
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,980
so it was a very kind of not

899
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:30,009
catastrophic but jarring consumer

900
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:32,590
experience for lack of probably a better

901
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,649
word for the attackers and as a result

902
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:37,750
of that right and the interesting path

903
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,490
of attack is that if you look on various

904
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,049
forums there's kind of a somewhat

905
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:44,350
negative opinion of now Jay socket

906
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,570
because they think all of these these

907
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,789
accidental takedowns you know we're just

908
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:50,620
kind of part of you know an exit

909
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,909
strategy you know what I just want to

910
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:53,409
get the Bitcoin and then stop running

911
00:33:53,409 --> 00:33:56,139
the service right so there's certainly a

912
00:33:56,139 --> 00:33:58,600
level of economic and reputation attacks

913
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,370
that we can do against adversaries right

914
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,830
in the absence of being able to do an

915
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,090
arrest right you know it doesn't make

916
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:07,480
any sense to you know make a criminal

917
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,760
you know look less reliable if you're

918
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,730
just going to rest him anyway right and

919
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,530
we'll get more on that that in a second

920
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:18,909
the economic reputational attacks okay I

921
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:20,710
think this is the last case study as

922
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,020
angler two months ago one month ago

923
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,089
Cisco said they took down part of angler

924
00:34:25,089 --> 00:34:28,510
you know blog post yay we took down a 30

925
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,460
million dollar exploit kit operation you

926
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,199
know but in reality all it was is that

927
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,879
they work with a hosting provider and

928
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:35,918
said hey let's clean up all the angler

929
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,960
you know on your network you know by the

930
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,579
way feel free to share any intelligence

931
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,949
you want with uh you know with us you

932
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,889
know and you know Cisco got you know a

933
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:46,750
new cycle out of it good for them right

934
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,879
but there was really minimal impact

935
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,069
angler right you know has anybody seen

936
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:55,810
angler disappear nobody no not one

937
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,460
person can even be sarcastic with me

938
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:04,750
right now anybody so so all right well

939
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,400
yeah it was my second show so I hit that

940
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,589
I hit the + button to fast write the

941
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:10,540
exam d botnet no that wasn't a takedown

942
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,829
there's something that never happened

943
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:15,849
right all right so how takedowns are

944
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:17,589
done you know and using the civil

945
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:19,060
process law enforcement has their own

946
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,060
tools right

947
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,070
you know kind of known there are some

948
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:26,170
civil paths of action you know for DNS

949
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:29,870
relatively easy you know because you

950
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,360
know domains are property and if you can

951
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,480
find some standing which is what another

952
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,220
point there you know you could say hey

953
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,020
you're harming me you're doing this bad

954
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,260
thing this prop this property you know

955
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,230
needs to be suspended right so most of

956
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,700
the Civil takedowns non-law enforcement

957
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,120
happen this way you know of there's some

958
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,040
civil action saying you know give me a

959
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,260
restraining order because this person is

960
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,510
it actively engaging in harm all right

961
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,580
the some other contractual means almost

962
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,250
every provider of services has some AUP

963
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,410
assuming it's not a criminal provider

964
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,660
that caters to providing services for

965
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,430
criminals at which point i guess you

966
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,260
could report to them but it's not like

967
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,750
they care the laugh at you you know but

968
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,180
for otherwise legitimate companies you

969
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,040
know you know hey you've got a problem

970
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,630
on your network violates your terms of

971
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,920
service you should do something about

972
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,310
that right which kind of goes into to

973
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,050
Frank's talk a little bit of working

974
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,760
with ISPs and having some of that direct

975
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,550
communication instead of just blowing up

976
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,160
Twitter and everything you know working

977
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,190
with an ISP to clean things up right

978
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,260
relatively easy sometimes requires more

979
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,360
of a relationship than others you know

980
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,850
but you know hopefully there's an abuse

981
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,310
desk to deal with this stuff right civil

982
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,870
litigation right comes with standing

983
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,930
issues which probably any like you know

984
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,480
there's probably true and on any legal

985
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,300
system though I'm not a international or

986
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,090
legal studies expert right in the United

987
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,830
States I can't say hey you know what

988
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,810
take down this domain because it's bad I

989
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,490
have to have some kind of skin in the

990
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,050
game right it needs to be attacking me

991
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,240
or attacking one of my constituents or a

992
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,100
customer or something like that you know

993
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,830
so part of the reason Microsoft you know

994
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,420
uses this to great effect is that

995
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,220
everybody's practically Microsoft's

996
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,870
customers even people who don't really

997
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,670
want to be Microsoft's customers or

998
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,500
using their stuff so Microsoft has great

999
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,030
standing and they got lawyers all over

1000
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,430
the place right you know I'm a small

1001
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,260
company 300 people right you know I'm

1002
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,760
not going to be able to sit there and

1003
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,160
file file lawsuits in every country on

1004
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,660
the planet it doesn't make sense for us

1005
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,740
to ever to build that

1006
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,930
city but can't do it in certain targeted

1007
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,070
ways but it's really got to be our

1008
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,869
customers something like that which

1009
00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:37,730
really reduces the scope of what I can

1010
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:42,110
do using litigation okay so kind of

1011
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,990
economic going back to the economic

1012
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:47,119
reputational attacks right probably a

1013
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,820
fairly underused I'm not fair it is an

1014
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,380
underused tactic that can be used in

1015
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,560
certain circumstances right probably not

1016
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,990
i mean if there's going to be an arrest

1017
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,190
why make somebody look bad and not make

1018
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,560
money right you know but if you can't

1019
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,510
really get to somebody right you know

1020
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,360
you can use takedowns to maximize kind

1021
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,550
of their reputational harm so in the

1022
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,830
case of alien spy right as an accidental

1023
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,600
so I wasn't even set up to do this when

1024
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,000
this happened right you know but this is

1025
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,950
a service provider providing services to

1026
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,110
other criminals right and the biggest

1027
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,940
problem they have we've got our problems

1028
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,130
they've got a problem right how do

1029
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,440
criminals trust other criminals right I

1030
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,690
mean you know the other guys not honest

1031
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:29,600
he's a criminal right you know and and

1032
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,550
people defraud other criminals all the

1033
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,470
time right i mentioned exit strategy on

1034
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:36,320
there you know which is used mostly for

1035
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,990
like Bitcoin exchanges and the like but

1036
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,850
it's a tactic that can be used anywhere

1037
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,890
it's like you know i've got all this

1038
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,570
money because people are passing bitcoin

1039
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:46,040
through me and then one day help sorry

1040
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,050
i'll a bitcoin wallets got stoled stolen

1041
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,970
closed now they just kind of put the

1042
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,230
wallets in their pocket walked away

1043
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,869
right you know the criminals they're

1044
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:55,130
gonna steal well steal from other

1045
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,780
criminals it's not like any others no

1046
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,020
honor among thieves that being said you

1047
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,240
know you can maximize an impact with you

1048
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,280
know with you know with a takedown

1049
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,990
operation if you can't get an arrest you

1050
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,940
can't get to somebody else right you

1051
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,859
could say hey you know what next time I

1052
00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:12,619
take down now Jay socket sit there and

1053
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:15,170
say you know get on the forums and sit

1054
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,450
there and push the idea that this guy is

1055
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,940
a fraudster at which point if he's not

1056
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,220
making money the threat goes away now

1057
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,560
granted you know may go to somebody else

1058
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,200
may craft a new identity but crafting

1059
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,270
identities take time crafting tie or

1060
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,310
reputation takes time crafting trust

1061
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:34,220
takes a lot of time right so certainly

1062
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,960
you know it's a very damaging thing to

1063
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,210
do right you can use this against other

1064
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,910
threats than I mentioned Kelly Oakes

1065
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,140
specifically right Kelly this is a spam

1066
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,990
botnet you know a lot of pill scam

1067
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,520
we'll talk about pill scans in specific

1068
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,920
right you know the operator of Chelios

1069
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,960
is not pushing drugs right they just run

1070
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,610
a spam botnet that's all they do and

1071
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:57,270
they get paid based on people you know

1072
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,970
their ability to deliver tons of emails

1073
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:01,380
you know but these pill companies have a

1074
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,590
supply chain in whatever I can go after

1075
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,060
them and say all right you know you can

1076
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,280
use Kelly Oakes that's fine you know but

1077
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,450
we're going to take your stuff in a

1078
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,119
civil process with you know the FTC or

1079
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,310
whatever at which point you know all

1080
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,020
right maybe they stopped sending spill

1081
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,390
scams right there's an economic

1082
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:20,100
counterbalance there so certainly a lot

1083
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,590
of things that we can do do in those

1084
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,150
regards to deal with kind of these

1085
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,890
persistent spam botnet problems that

1086
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,869
have been around forever and aren't

1087
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:30,210
going away at least for a certain subset

1088
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:33,510
of scams right you know part of chaos is

1089
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,150
Russian dating spam I don't know how to

1090
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,040
do a reputation attack against that

1091
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,920
because I don't know why people would

1092
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,540
look at a Russian mail-order bride /

1093
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,220
email and actually send money I can't

1094
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,910
get my mind around that but people do

1095
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:55,740
this so dealing with non cooperating

1096
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,180
jurisdictions I put that in n quotes

1097
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,220
right you know because it's not really a

1098
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,410
value judgment I mean you know I'm an

1099
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,359
American like I said American government

1100
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,070
has had historical problems getting

1101
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,260
cooperation from Russia and China not

1102
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,640
taking the site in that it just is what

1103
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,350
it is right I'm a citizen I've got no

1104
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,869
influence on that crap you know but just

1105
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:14,250
because the government's can't cooperate

1106
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,840
it certainly means it doesn't mean

1107
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,090
private sector entities can't also write

1108
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:22,220
or can't can't interact you know so

1109
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,450
unfortunately I said that that involves

1110
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,800
a fair bit of travel right you know to

1111
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,930
build those relationships you know going

1112
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:29,820
other place and say hey you know k

1113
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,109
you're seeing this stuff in the United

1114
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:32,430
States all right I'll go to help you

1115
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,750
deal with that problem I'm seeing this

1116
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,820
stuff in the Russian Federation go help

1117
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,500
me out with that right you know

1118
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,450
certainly might not necessarily lead to

1119
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,670
arrests it might you know if the actor

1120
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,140
is somewhere in a jurisdiction that we

1121
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,050
can reach right you know but that's

1122
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,359
basically relationship maintenance and

1123
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:49,859
there's no good way of doing that except

1124
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:52,800
actual facetime right and you know what

1125
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,480
I've told my wife who you know and my

1126
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,700
kids who don't understand why I travel

1127
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,260
so much it's like I can get more done

1128
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,450
on sitting in a room with somebody for

1129
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,490
15 minutes then I can three months over

1130
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:06,390
email you know working virtually you

1131
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,190
know of people that are kind of outside

1132
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,710
a small circle of an organization or

1133
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,810
whatever just takes a lot of time right

1134
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,520
you know but getting everybody in the

1135
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,830
same room saying let's deal with this we

1136
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,810
can resolve things relatively quickly

1137
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:21,360
right but unfortunately that means you

1138
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,180
know I've got almost 250,000 frequent

1139
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:27,120
flyer miles for just this year but my

1140
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,470
family's going to get a good vacation of

1141
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:29,670
it so they can't complain that much

1142
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:33,450
right but trust lists electronic you

1143
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,160
know groups you know the good right you

1144
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,980
know i have several you many many of you

1145
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,870
were in them you know they're not bad

1146
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,490
things I'm not bagging on it but it's

1147
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,470
not enough it actually takes time to

1148
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,750
build relationships outside of your own

1149
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:49,800
geography ok so my particular entry

1150
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,570
requirements so to speak you know of

1151
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,830
when I'm going to actually pull the

1152
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,900
trigger on something is the first is

1153
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,120
willing partners right you know I'm

1154
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,580
hugely busy and there's only so much my

1155
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,620
expertise is and certain things right I

1156
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,240
need other people to be involved and if

1157
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,710
not other people are interested okay

1158
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,330
well nobody's interested I'll go move on

1159
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,340
to something that people are interested

1160
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,870
on and it's pretty easy to find

1161
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,580
something that somebody's interested in

1162
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,860
right you know some relevant threat

1163
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,660
right you know obvious i'm not going to

1164
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,890
go after something that's that's

1165
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:20,040
nonsense or you know some some low-rent

1166
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,690
stuff unless there's a good reason for

1167
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,480
me to do it right Third Point you know

1168
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,280
thorough knowledge you know of the

1169
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,050
primary and backup means a communication

1170
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,700
right I don't want to shoot something in

1171
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,290
the head and only hit its foot you know

1172
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:32,820
I want to kill I don't want a flesh

1173
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,770
wound you know I'm the only way to do

1174
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,270
that is know how it communicates and

1175
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:38,160
then you know you're going to run into

1176
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,190
tour and I to pee stuff that is

1177
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,240
complicated but not impossible to

1178
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,580
resolve right which might you know but

1179
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,870
there might be a case is like I really

1180
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,790
want to kill this but I can't because I

1181
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,320
can't get to all of the resources

1182
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,870
necessary to do it right you know and

1183
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,550
doing that risk analysis that I

1184
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:54,750
mentioned is like you know what's the

1185
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,240
risk of collateral damage you know when

1186
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,620
what's the risk of deception which I'm

1187
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,870
not talking about a great deal here but

1188
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,490
the attackers note we're looking at they

1189
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:04,800
know how to deceive us right and it's

1190
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,630
very it's a lot easier than we think

1191
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:09,660
right so making sure that is this am I

1192
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,250
really shooting what I think I'm

1193
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:11,700
shooting

1194
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,920
or they somehow you know screwing with

1195
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,550
my intelligence wrapping it up you know

1196
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:19,200
takedowns just another form of

1197
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,849
disruption that we do every day right

1198
00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:22,290
it's not something unique and distinct

1199
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:23,430
it's just part of the spectrum of

1200
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:26,700
operations you know Mikey having some

1201
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,800
ultimate objectives you know is the key

1202
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,390
of you know what do I want to accomplish

1203
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:32,430
not a takedown for the sake of a

1204
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,589
takedown and marketing right you know

1205
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,570
and D conflicting at least with law

1206
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,490
enforcement if not working right you

1207
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:40,560
know to make sure that I don't Scotch a

1208
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,170
case to put somebody in jail because I'd

1209
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,089
rather have people in jail than to have

1210
00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:47,820
a notch in my belt on a takedown you

1211
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,130
know cooperation you know having you

1212
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,570
having broad cooperation across

1213
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:54,329
jurisdictions right global problem you

1214
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:56,450
know needs to have global partners right

1215
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:59,760
and being better the last point if you

1216
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,170
informing the public right is taking

1217
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:03,089
these opportunities when you know there

1218
00:45:03,089 --> 00:45:04,410
is actually a lot of media around

1219
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,060
something and say hey you know what yeah

1220
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,500
we took this down you know this

1221
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,780
ransomware family you know but really

1222
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,300
pay attention to not opening zip files

1223
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,579
with an HTML file that redirects and

1224
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:17,220
then involve infects your machine with

1225
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,540
ransomware don't do that because it's

1226
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,000
not legitimate email certainly take some

1227
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,849
of those steps to just inform you know

1228
00:45:22,849 --> 00:45:25,880
Joe Sixpack or whatever the equivalent

1229
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,200
expression is in other countries for the

1230
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,930
common and teach them something about

1231
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:35,460
security alright so I forgot all my

1232
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,930
business cards because I dropped my

1233
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:38,609
laptop up from the hotel but there's my

1234
00:45:38,609 --> 00:45:40,050
information if you want to get in touch

1235
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:41,910
with anything that I do there's a bunch

1236
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:43,829
of groups that I Ron feel free to get in

1237
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:45,089
touch because I'm always looking for

1238
00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:47,010
more people to do more things so

1239
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,760
questions

1240
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:07,300
leagues it was revealed that after a

1241
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,940
botnet is take down it is transferred to

1242
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,730
FBI and it is transferred to NSA and

1243
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:16,600
they filter the target for some juicy

1244
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,730
victims and God knows what happens with

1245
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:21,010
that what is your short opinion about

1246
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:26,440
this my short opinion is is that if I'm

1247
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,540
doing a take down and we're sink holing

1248
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,370
the sinkholes for victim notification

1249
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,310
and odds are i will probably use shadow

1250
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:34,840
server for that because they're set up

1251
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,600
for it I and i I do do tactical sync

1252
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,730
holing right you know of to gather

1253
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,590
intelligence but doing kind of long-term

1254
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,020
stuff let's shadow server do it victim

1255
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,370
notification if shadow service

1256
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:47,830
cooperating with the NSA I guess

1257
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:49,150
eventually somebody will figure that out

1258
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:51,280
we use somebody else right that's just

1259
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,790
not what that's for right so you know if

1260
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:57,640
I caught that then you know I'd there be

1261
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,290
a lot less cooperation with me with

1262
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:01,060
whatever Party was playing that stunt in

1263
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:08,020
the future free uh-huh yeah you

1264
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:11,290
mentioned earlier in your slides about

1265
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,680
limited success of dry docks campaign

1266
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,290
could you elaborate why wasn't that

1267
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:19,480
enough people sent to gallows pole or or

1268
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,630
or what I wasn't part of that operation

1269
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,060
but there was there were aspects of it

1270
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,620
that I thought were going to be done

1271
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:29,890
that weren't done and I said this is

1272
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,750
where I'm kind of being intentionally

1273
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:38,020
vague but you know it's not dead and

1274
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,910
gone right right you know there was an

1275
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:43,180
arrest an arrest is good not having

1276
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,830
firsthand intelligence about who it is

1277
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,300
it seems like they arrested one of the

1278
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,340
affiliates and not necessarily there was

1279
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:51,070
a primary actor so arrests are good

1280
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:53,860
right you know you know Eric arrest more

1281
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:57,040
people have fun right yeah you know but

1282
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,920
still a threat still out there right so

1283
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,230
i would say limited success I mean it's

1284
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,330
still I said successes I'll take

1285
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:06,280
anything right you know I'm a beggar

1286
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,470
right married for kids driver carries no

1287
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:11,470
cash I'll take anything so it's not yet

1288
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:15,820
over right okay thanks last question

1289
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:22,990
over there yeah hi oh my god would you

1290
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:25,300
say about the idexx that sends the rest

1291
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,360
there was significant change in activity

1292
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:34,450
in latex activity I don't know if my

1293
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,790
data has test full visibility in a dry

1294
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:37,900
decks to be able to answer that

1295
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,900
authoritative Lee my and it's not

1296
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,730
something that that I personally looked

1297
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:45,160
at in the past few weeks my impression

1298
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,600
is I don't know if there's been

1299
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,930
significant changes or what I would

1300
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,480
describe the significant changes now

1301
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,770
that being said there's certainly a

1302
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,240
place for arresting affiliates and I

1303
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,280
