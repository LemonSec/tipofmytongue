1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
veronica is the last presentation before

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:10,349
the break so be nice with her as you see

3
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,620
from the title the presentation might

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,750
raise a number of questions so think

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,750
about it and when you do ask questions

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,990
later make them short and quick so the

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,359
only guy can have time to to answer all

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,189
of them the only guy you have the floor

9
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,949
ok thank you I hope you guys hear me

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,110
yeah responsible ok so my name is

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,899
Veronica I work for the cognitive tried

12
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,059
analytics team in cisco czech republic

13
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,690
and i'm going to talk about an analysis

14
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,920
of network traffic that of a mal work

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,739
that we run in our lab and that in that

16
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,969
in it end up in a brute forcing attack

17
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:03,420
so if you have questions you can ask

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,590
them later or feel free to ping me later

19
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,380
so okay so as many of you I work

20
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,110
studying and analyzing network traffic

21
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,590
from alwar mostly from different sources

22
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,570
usually these sources are very small

23
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,619
like blogs Twitter trackers every source

24
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,320
of intelligence that many of you had to

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,460
create but so these are usually small

26
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,729
sources and then I can apply to the

27
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,740
Tecton identify tried seen like large

28
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,380
amount of data like real traffic in

29
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,229
insider or company and customers and so

30
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,409
on but most of these sources of data

31
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:52,770
from my world has been run for mostly

32
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,750
from one to five minutes that's the

33
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,620
usual sandbox in time for example

34
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,350
most of the blogs and reports some

35
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,750
sometimes cover this time maybe more

36
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,130
than me its top maybe one hour but

37
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,570
usually there is no more intelligence

38
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,270
more than one hour maybe some hours but

39
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,970
not so much so the question is like what

40
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,740
happened next what the malware does

41
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,470
after one hour of infection what the

42
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,600
malware does after one week of infection

43
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,000
what the mango does when has been

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,280
running for a month is something changed

45
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,740
it is like worse to run mad one more

46
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,810
time or not maybe maybe it's not maybe

47
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,550
it's just five minutes we have

48
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,120
everything we need right so I was

49
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,700
curious about the about this so I want

50
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,700
to try it so I run it this malware in

51
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,480
your love is the sandbox environment is

52
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,490
very basic is not nothing from nothing

53
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,180
complex it runs filter box I don't have

54
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,870
any until Tony station tricks is just

55
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,730
normal BM they actually the malware is a

56
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,590
camera and Romelu malwa it was come

57
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,320
categorization his car we base or

58
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,570
judgment on some virus total results

59
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,660
also from the traffic and also Jose is

60
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,940
going to talk about Toro about Gamma Rho

61
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,709
and remain as well so he also

62
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:28,270
double-check these so we took this

63
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,690
malware run it in your laugh and we let

64
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,940
it run for a month and this is called

65
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,140
them malware infection is an area looks

66
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,250
like so the infection started in May 12

67
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,110
and we let it run until june twelfth and

68
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,090
you can see well infections started and

69
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,540
the first 10 days

70
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,480
the bonnet was alive the command control

71
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,439
was was active there was some

72
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,180
communication but there was no

73
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,519
instruction from the one master the

74
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,920
bonded the boat actually was kind of

75
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,310
either we call it so there was nothing

76
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,140
happening but from from the one master

77
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,849
point of view this is our waste of money

78
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:17,649
because you have some machine in fact in

79
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:20,440
even if it's in a sandbox environment it

80
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,120
is kind of not giving any profit so

81
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,800
after some time it seems that something

82
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,770
happened and that the behavior change

83
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,110
the body was instructed to start

84
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,520
downloading new pilots it attempted we

85
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,979
are going to see later how many it tried

86
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:42,130
to the Lord and then some of them worked

87
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,360
and we can see that at some point it

88
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,190
trigger another infection and from that

89
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,470
moment on the word the body was infected

90
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,430
like twice and we have like two common

91
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,169
controls communicating at the same time

92
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:58,419
and that new behavior was the brute

93
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:00,389
forcing the time going to cover later

94
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:04,210
but if you can see the graph the route

95
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,460
14 behavior lasted only four days and

96
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,460
after that the primary component control

97
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,610
was he was instructing about to start

98
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,960
download new fails to change the

99
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,650
behavior again but it seems that I don't

100
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,690
know something happened there wasn't

101
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,000
nothing interesting in the last end of

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,240
the capture so this is called the

103
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,289
traffic looks like from the camera

104
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:31,349
common control it's a simple HTTP

105
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:34,120
request post request you can see that

106
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,669
there is and keep the traffic being sent

107
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,760
and received I didn't reverse the vinery

108
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,010
so I'm just focusing network traffic so

109
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,139
because I from the network perspective I

110
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,550
cannot do anything about this so i

111
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,190
calculated some statistics

112
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:56,740
characteristics about the traffic so I i

113
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,889
took some values about the amount of ID

114
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:01,630
sense without headers

115
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,520
like the beer data transmitted over time

116
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,640
in a daily basis and you can see that

117
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,380
the bot contacted actually three

118
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,590
different servers but only one was

119
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,900
active and that's the red one was alive

120
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,350
during the 30 days but there was no

121
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,000
difference with it with the other two

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,150
the amount of data sent by the bot it

123
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,200
was a very stable along the the

124
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,600
infection it wasn't the same with the

125
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,470
receive advice we can see here that in

126
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,830
red there is the active command control

127
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,490
and the amount of fights was very small

128
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:43,750
on the contrary w1 the server was

129
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,410
responding but it actually it was an

130
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,650
error code and it seems like a not

131
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,990
crafted ever call it was just normal one

132
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,280
and I think that probably server was on

133
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,950
the and after some days he'd stop trying

134
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:04,330
to contact that server and in the end of

135
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,920
the capture we tried the boat righted

136
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,200
attempted to contact another common

137
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,680
control server but while it was replying

138
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,190
it was replying with zero white so I

139
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:20,380
think it also wasn't very alive so this

140
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,860
is the activity of how the Gamma Rho

141
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,250
command control was downloading new

142
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,990
instruction the WOD to download new

143
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,000
pilot and this is very interesting

144
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,430
because this is a primary command

145
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,290
control that was leaned infection and

146
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,470
was said telling the machine how to

147
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,910
behave and you can see that it was very

148
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,860
busy and most one of the most

149
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,840
interesting the second one more

150
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,270
interesting part is the one that you can

151
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,790
see in the middle that I don't know if

152
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,980
you can read the names of it since I is

153
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,620
the same file name but version so maybe

154
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,569
somebody was trying new versions of

155
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:02,929
work and see if they worked or not but

156
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:05,679
we are going to focus on the fifth one

157
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:07,639
because that's the one that triggered

158
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:13,610
the brute force and activity so then

159
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,129
this file was not loading downloaded

160
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:19,429
from this server it was a HTTP request

161
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:22,879
like this like very plain downloading

162
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,179
some excellent if you're in a network

163
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:31,639
this is very suspicious you can have the

164
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,539
cash here later the the malware was a

165
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:38,269
very simple functionality it was capable

166
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:42,110
of performing logins to WordPress sites

167
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,208
and then communicating with the command

168
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,920
and control in in different ways

169
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,959
informing whether it was successful or

170
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:51,350
not so from the traffic point of view

171
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,990
and the command and control

172
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,600
communication of this malware was HTTP

173
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,149
and there was no encryption nothing

174
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:02,779
she's plain text and the communication

175
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:05,209
can be splitted in three different

176
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:08,720
behaviors the first behavior is were the

177
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,050
first request you consider where the

178
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,639
boat was communicating the status of the

179
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,630
of the brute forcing so there are some

180
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,389
parameters like which gate he was used

181
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:26,180
how many good but unlucky results and so

182
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,560
on and the second behavior was where the

183
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,949
world was retrieving the files txt files

184
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,259
containing a list of work besides to

185
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:41,720
root for lady and it was also the answer

186
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,329
in plain text plain text as we are going

187
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:45,270
to see and

188
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,510
the third one was were a special request

189
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,780
that happened in very low volume that

190
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,680
the body used to actually report the

191
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,990
successful attempts especially the

192
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,310
successful attempts so this is an

193
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:07,350
example of report status request and we

194
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,420
can see that how these requests is

195
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,760
linked it to the second behavior because

196
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,580
in the answer there is a next file that

197
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,390
the board should retrieve and this is

198
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,730
the file that is retrieve a devout and

199
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,370
you consider the list of sites that is

200
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,750
just ally of txt file with maximum 1000

201
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,390
sides or their alphabetically and

202
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,000
sometimes the files containing just

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,080
1,000 sites starting with a sometimes

204
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,190
starting with g and so on here is an

205
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,870
example of one of these sites you can

206
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,970
see that it's possible that they are

207
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,870
WordPress race and this one is kind of

208
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,660
shedding I'm not sure if it's legit but

209
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:57,540
anyway and this is where the bot sends

210
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,050
the success data you can see the request

211
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,170
is is interesting because is it split so

212
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,780
you are not going to see it quite well

213
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,470
even a proxy log but extending the

214
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,460
domain that was successful as part of

215
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:20,730
the post request so this is this is the

216
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,550
brute force in activity overview in the

217
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,500
in the the white is the amount of

218
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,530
requests per day HTTP requests and you

219
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,540
can see that only the fourth day the

220
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,900
first four days where the brute forcing

221
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,640
was active and the the red one is where

222
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,250
it was how many files were retrieved and

223
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,550
you can see that this about once a 100

224
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,420
per day mostly and there were also some

225
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,550
success data requests which is quite

226
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,170
interesting because it seems that did

227
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:52,980
work

228
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,620
right so there isn't a brute forcing I

229
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,300
say it's horizontal but forcing because

230
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,250
it's not that the boat was attempted

231
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:08,940
attempting to access us website trying a

232
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,589
thousand different password user

233
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:13,350
password combinations for each side it

234
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,110
was updating just one or two

235
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,820
combinations / / site and trying many

236
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,949
sites at the same time so i couldn't i

237
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:28,350
had only pick up so I could see what

238
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,570
user password combinations it had a

239
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:34,470
tried and most done more than fifty

240
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,570
percent of the cases it tried admin and

241
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,959
mean I guess it was hard-coded in the

242
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,120
binary because the word didn't retrieve

243
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,690
any password leads from anywhere the

244
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,149
other combination was mean and some

245
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:50,699
custom password and this is interesting

246
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:54,389
because the bot had the functionality to

247
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:58,160
some somehow craft the domain the

248
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,870
possible potential password for that

249
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,319
site based on the name of the domain

250
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:06,449
that was attempting to logging so if you

251
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:08,550
have for example we wanted come it will

252
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:13,829
try admin Google and yeah it worked so

253
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:17,839
in total there were more than 8,600

254
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,860
Samsung custom passwords attempted you

255
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,750
can see here some examples there are

256
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,740
some Slavic wars that are interesting

257
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:34,319
some polish cities and some typically

258
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:36,420
this this custom passwords are

259
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,220
associated with domain name so it makes

260
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,370
sense

261
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:48,200
okay some how aggressive it was so every

262
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,470
day if there were more than 40,000 sites

263
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,540
that devote attempted to logging and

264
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,790
that's a lot and in total you can see

265
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,650
that it was very aggressive border for a

266
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,550
very short period of time and that's it

267
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,640
so it was it was my interesting to see

268
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,920
and so in total devote alone one bottle

269
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,140
own tried to login into more than

270
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,290
150,000 work besides with only 23

271
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,580
success cases so the ratio of successful

272
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,030
pneus is it is also interesting to have

273
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:33,410
in mind for this type of automated work

274
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,130
that the boat was doing this is an

275
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:42,110
example of a website that was actually

276
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,890
the boat was able to log in and you can

277
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:49,070
see that is a Brazilian blog there is

278
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,400
nothing seemingly wrong with it and if

279
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,890
you I don't know if you can read but by

280
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,350
stata have a report on that I piece with

281
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,660
some malicious heat on August that's a

282
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,660
couple of months later since my boat was

283
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,960
able to log into the site so you can you

284
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,660
can get the economic cycle here like we

285
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,610
have about that is just attempting to

286
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,400
massively login into size and you can

287
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,500
sell them and then other people install

288
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,540
malware and then you can send a phishing

289
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:23,780
email to get more users infected I'm not

290
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,810
sure about how much access to this type

291
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,150
of sites cost but you can make the

292
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:35,180
control how profitable this can be in

293
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,090
just one board was in my point of view

294
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,390
was kind of very successful getting six

295
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,910
new sites for free every day

296
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,210
if you have like 100 baht 1,000 baht

297
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,970
that's a lot and there is a lot of

298
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,040
bondage like for example crypto wall

299
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,530
that when you analyze their command

300
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,330
control traffic they are all using

301
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,570
WordPress Hackett sites to communicate

302
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,940
with to Costa Rica man controls

303
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,220
momentarily and then they just move on

304
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,160
to another server so the question of

305
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,220
world oh how do they get this type of

306
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,950
site may this might be an answer right

307
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,640
in the end i did a analysis of how these

308
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,730
targeted sites were distributed because

309
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,640
i was just worried if this was a

310
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,970
targeted attack on so i was part of the

311
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,180
source of the dark so I was kind of

312
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,570
concerned but as you can see there was

313
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:42,960
no special distribution of targets the

314
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,780
only word besides were kind of well

315
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,540
distributed among the world and there is

316
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,900
of course a high amount of sites in US

317
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:57,300
but that's I guess that's okay so there

318
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,240
wasn't any special this is not a

319
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:07,380
targeted attack so it's cool so my

320
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,730
conclusions were that yeah we would we

321
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,730
would have never seen this type of

322
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,060
malware behavior ever even the this type

323
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,359
of payload vein job if we run the

324
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,280
malware choose one hour so it's kind of

325
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,380
worth not for all the Marvel of course

326
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,280
but maybe some samples it is called also

327
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,380
it's important to execute the malware in

328
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,900
like with real internet access many some

329
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,930
boxing solutions don't do that and it's

330
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,820
not really possible to see what the

331
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,370
Manoir really does if you are emulating

332
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:47,130
it also sometimes there are reports

333
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,890
saying this man washes behaving this way

334
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,299
tomorrow is Justin

335
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:54,239
motion stealer yeah we cannot define a

336
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,190
bond that anymore by a single behavior

337
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,809
they can update themselves like very

338
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:02,820
fast so and all the route 14 actually

339
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,669
work because we are still having

340
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,739
credentials with a mean and mean and

341
00:18:07,739 --> 00:18:13,619
mean google and mean my side so all the

342
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:15,509
work we are doing in education I think

343
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:20,070
still is not enough so we should work

344
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,470
more than that and if you have questions

345
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,129
we have some minutes

346
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,370
so we have some time for a few questions

347
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:43,159
in the middle introduce yourself table

348
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,570
ok my name is tebow I work for the

349
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,030
sorter G and with Thomas you may know

350
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,850
him I was asking did you make any

351
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,040
statistics about the websites that were

352
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,020
attacked by these botnets you talk about

353
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,870
WordPress you saw a lot of it it was

354
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,750
specifically corporate ok and it seems

355
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,780
that the malware has like some kind of

356
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,750
hard coded the way how to create the

357
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,230
post request ok so the WP login excited

358
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,520
PHP exit route before single ok ok and

359
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,070
any kind of website young WordPress to

360
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,200
all purple all my always WordPress

361
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,570
without any kind of website it can be

362
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,370
you just a blog or something or

363
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:29,090
corporate websites yeah it wasn't any

364
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:35,550
yeah only on the targets were of people

365
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,030
creating work besides that hosted on

366
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,710
their own domains there wasn't any

367
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,680
domain something that wordpress.com it

368
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,350
was just it seems that people buy that

369
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,970
kind of site and they create their own

370
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,320
blog or site thank you very much yeah on

371
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,520
the right here when did you analyze the

372
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:03,980
sample when did you receive it roughly I

373
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,170
found them all or around april and i

374
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,160
started the infection on me and for for

375
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,430
a month so okay yeah i just found like

376
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,440
early samples all the way from back to

377
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,930
May 5th listed on malware calm so it was

378
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,810
interesting that it was very close yeah

379
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,810
well I didn't submit it there so maybe

380
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,440
somebody else was trying to shake it up

381
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,850
yeah but thinks yeah Andromeda is a

382
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,029
plug-in based yeah I started did you see

383
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,860
the plugin download and did you see

384
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,710
anything else or just that well I in

385
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,320
this case I chose analysis brute forcing

386
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,110
one but you can see how it was

387
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:53,539
downloading different type of files and

388
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:55,529
Jose is going to talk about plugins

389
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:58,590
tomorrow but I I believe that many of

390
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,840
them might be some updates to London but

391
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,769
I didn't took a look at the vinery said

392
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:15,169
other questions one in the middle Dennis

393
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,230
hi hi working out work my name is Dennis

394
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,230
from IBM the question is mother was

395
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,230
running on your system for about a month

396
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,419
yeah and during this month your cisco

397
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:30,639
were contacted by any law enforcement

398
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:32,830
agency someone to say you know your

399
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,629
brute forcing our servers please stop it

400
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:42,100
no thank you answer is no but actually

401
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,000
and from my detection point of view it's

402
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,580
not that it wasn't a vertical

403
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,740
brute-forcing that someone could notice

404
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,429
right because if you are if you are

405
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:58,600
monitoring the purpose server will at

406
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,870
least one or ten more besides were were

407
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,389
hosted you will see only done request of

408
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,549
looking at least you know at least a

409
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:08,649
localized speed at cisco connected this

410
00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:10,090
year the czech republic can ask you a

411
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,500
question but since no

412
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:19,590
last question I'm retail job from

413
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,529
Microsoft I got two questions one so

414
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:25,110
you're kinda related to what yes sorry

415
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,360
running the mother in for one month is

416
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,460
it a supervised or unsupervised running

417
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,730
really you know how do you supervise and

418
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,580
taking off I decided oh maybe doing some

419
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,010
other pillows essay with the email

420
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,289
account that you have in your vm they

421
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:41,880
might send other mothers in tubs

422
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,340
something malicious activity that you

423
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,899
cannot control how do you you know

424
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:49,850
control that how do you monitor that I

425
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,429
actually these long-term manual capture

426
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:55,529
experiments were kind of unsupervised

427
00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:59,220
Aisha's infected on trying not to even

428
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,130
open the machine or use it so it was it

429
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,220
was kind of let's see I was of course

430
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,350
checking the network traffic to every

431
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,649
every day to check that this kind of was

432
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:15,600
under control kindness but i only have

433
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,669
blocked some spam because i'm not

434
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:19,350
interested in that type of traffic but

435
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,890
the race it was kind of completely

436
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:26,340
unsupervised that one more so you're

437
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,620
tracking the smaller and are you guys

438
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,230
taking note of the server where this

439
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:35,240
successful brute force has supported i'm

440
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,590
painting out like if you have a list of

441
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,590
server word rip where the mall report

442
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:45,630
this successful attacks well we have the

443
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:51,659
command and control servers and from for

444
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:54,870
the words that were successfully

445
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,000
attacked we are trying to contact them

446
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,520
before polishing any more information

447
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,830
same thing it might be interesting to

448
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,140
correlate it to the maullers that

449
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:08,730
distributed by a wordpress yeah i wonder

450
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,830
if you could share that the port service

451
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,080
yeah i think so we might talk like that

452
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,460
thank you

453
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:23,250
thank you you're breaking the braid okay

454
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:31,710
last question here hi and what is

455
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:38,100
cognitive security research we are very

456
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,970
short we are grouping site cisco that we

457
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,029
work doing animal addiction in network

458
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:49,919
traffic doing machine learning thank you

459
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,279
yeah
