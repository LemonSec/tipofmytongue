1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,510
so normally in an IT security conference

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,830
in France you get a lot of antsy talks

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,420
and actually this is I think it's the

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,790
first time she talked at bot conf yes

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,250
yeah so maybe it's a sign for more talks

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,680
in the future yep you had more

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,349
submissions yeah here yeah and hopefully

8
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:30,990
next year you'll push more of your

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,640
colleagues to do to do work for us so

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,320
they work on IT security for critical

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,360
infrastructure for the French

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,250
administration every time there's an apt

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,480
quote targeting France they have to work

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,329
on it

15
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:58,250
you guys are moved from the research

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,770
area and you work with the guys from the

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,549
deserts so they want to share about

18
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:12,900
air-gap bouncing or going over air gaps

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,180
with malware communications that make

20
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,240
possible new situations for setting up

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,780
botnets so you have the floor thank you

22
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,729
very much is it ok for the sound great

23
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,659
well a good morning boot conf I'm Josie

24
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,140
and this is Shoki and we are going to

25
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,780
present some research we did about the

26
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,409
air gap bypass techniques this work was

27
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,509
made in collaboration with our friend

28
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,500
Philip huge Murray sit under hiding in

29
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:57,439
the crowd and where is the mouse

30
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,650
so we work for the French Network and

31
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,900
information security agency and we

32
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,800
belong to the wireless security lab our

33
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,840
main research topics are electromagnetic

34
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,010
threats on information systems radio

35
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,860
communication security and we do also

36
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,709
some embedded system stuff and signal

37
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,620
processing and unfortunately we are not

38
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,739
malware or botnet analysts but we found

39
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:32,200
other ways to have fun so the agenda for

40
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,840
today we will present what is an air-gap

41
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,650
and then we will propose you a brief

42
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,860
overview of a recent state-of-the-art

43
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,730
techniques for bypassing the air gaps

44
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,810
then we will present you introduce the

45
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,769
intentional electromagnetic

46
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:53,739
interferences and we will show you how

47
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:57,160
we use this to design a new inbound

48
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,620
covered channel to send information to

49
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,959
an air-gapped computer and then we will

50
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,530
try to give you some recommendations and

51
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:14,760
a short conclusion so what is an air gap

52
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,420
in nowadays critical infrastructures the

53
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,700
users are facing working with several

54
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,650
information systems and these

55
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,540
information systems have different

56
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,269
levels of criticality and different

57
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:34,650
levels of trust and one main one

58
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,310
interesting question is if an untrusted

59
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,530
information system gets compromised

60
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,780
is it possible to mitigate the risk of

61
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,670
malware dissemination or contamination

62
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,420
of the trusted ones and is it possible

63
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,609
also to mitigate the other one which is

64
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,000
the exfiltration of data from the

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,040
trusted information system to the

66
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,840
untrusted ones so I draw a little

67
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,709
picture for you

68
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:10,629
so this represents a system or a user

69
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:12,170
which has

70
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,329
day to day work to have access to

71
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,850
untrusted information systems and

72
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,250
critical information systems this is a

73
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,860
simplified view because it's too early

74
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,080
in the morning and the social event was

75
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,500
yesterday so I simplified everything for

76
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,150
the presentation and the risk here is

77
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:39,050
the permeability from the untrusted

78
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,470
information system to the the critical

79
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,410
information system so the idea behind

80
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,230
the air gap is to physically separate

81
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:53,000
both information systems more formal

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,300
definition is the air gap is a physical

83
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,280
isolation of the information systems of

84
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,070
the sensitive ones it consists in

85
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,650
basically a removal of the communication

86
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,040
channels or interfaces with the machines

87
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,770
from different less trusted information

88
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,100
systems and the goal is to mitigate the

89
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,620
risk of interaction between those

90
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:23,120
information systems and may when you set

91
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,680
up an air gap you face many many

92
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,650
drawbacks and the first is that it

93
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,270
implies a multiplication of the

94
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,490
infrastructures so you have to duplicate

95
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,650
the machines you have to duplicate the

96
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,160
networking hardware and so on so it

97
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,250
costs a lot of money and you have much

98
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,010
less space on your desk and this

99
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,130
increases the temptation of using KVM

100
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,500
switches which is a not a good idea in

101
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,560
this case and we will see why and also

102
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,860
it introduces a lot of work process

103
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,539
constraints and organizational

104
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,729
constraints for the user in his

105
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:06,680
day-to-day work because data has still

106
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,800
to be shared in some way between the

107
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,550
information systems so there are some EQ

108
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,090
equipments that the user can use

109
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,770
sanitization devices and its

110
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:27,350
very constraining process so the result

111
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,860
is that the day-to-day life of users of

112
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,280
critical infrastructures you have many

113
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,380
computers many screens many keyboards

114
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,360
and less space on the desk now I will

115
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,460
shortly present a state of the art of

116
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,890
recent techniques it's interesting

117
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,380
because the last three years they have

118
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,360
there has been a lot of publications

119
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,510
about air gap bridging techniques and we

120
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,290
are going to pass through them now so

121
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,200
first I will introduce or remind you

122
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,110
what is a covered channel and then we

123
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,000
will move on the different techniques

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,270
that can exploit covered channels to set

125
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,270
up a communication channel between an

126
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,880
isolated system and the outside world

127
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,520
covered channel is a technique that

128
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,070
allows an information transfer whether

129
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,970
in Europe bi-directional between two

130
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,919
entities that are not allowed to

131
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,500
communicate through a channel that is

132
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,010
not intended for communication and the

133
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,110
main prerequisite for using a covered

134
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,960
channel is that the both ends need to

135
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,440
know the covered channel and they need

136
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,320
to know the communication protocol with

137
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,660
which will go over the the covered

138
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,060
channel to be able to understand each

139
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,390
other

140
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,960
so this require preliminary infection so

141
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,229
the main eye hypothesis here is that the

142
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:01,070
sensitive machine got infected by

143
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,120
malware and one of the machines of the

144
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,140
untrusted world is also infected with

145
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,450
the malware and the main goal of the

146
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,390
attacker is to be able to create a

147
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,280
communication between those two machines

148
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,419
so the first technique that can be used

149
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,320
to bridge an air gap is by using the

150
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,410
disabled interfaces the way that the

151
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,419
administrator will remove the

152
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,630
communication interfaces

153
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,370
is really important in that case and

154
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,320
disable disabling the the interfaces by

155
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,820
software is obviously not enough and

156
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,460
using a hardware hardware kill switch on

157
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,430
the computer may also not be enough as

158
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:55,160
it has been emphasizing research from

159
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,330
some guys from Intel at hakito ergo zoom

160
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,110
this year they showed that if you can

161
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,160
take control of the firmware of

162
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,390
networking controller wireless

163
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,210
networking controller then the hardware

164
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,670
kill switch had no effect and the

165
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,000
controller was still on so it is still

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,780
possible to establish a communication

167
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,150
outside and it's still possible to

168
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,980
communicate from the operating system to

169
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,580
the malicious firmware so they have

170
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,370
obviously to be physically removed those

171
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,390
interfaces it's also possible to exploit

172
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,150
a cover channel by using shared

173
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:44,760
peripherals we peripherals can be used

174
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,870
simultaneously or alternatively between

175
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,310
the trusted machine and the untrusted

176
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:55,380
machine and peripherals are in closed

177
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,050
microcontrollers and memory chips so

178
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,240
this gives persistent storage or

179
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,430
persistent state and it can be used to

180
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,960
exploit a software logical cover channel

181
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,870
so it is the case for USB devices and

182
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,660
more interestingly and surprisingly for

183
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,210
display devices which are also equipped

184
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,020
with memory chips and they are

185
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,170
accessible from the operating system and

186
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:29,550
sometimes they are writable and the KVM

187
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:34,170
switches used with vulnerable display

188
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:39,390
devices can make the situation worse so

189
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,230
to illustrate that usually a KVM allows

190
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,030
a direct communication between the

191
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,790
active-active host and the display

192
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,550
device so when the flash memory is

193
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,240
writable

194
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,900
the active host has the ability to read

195
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,270
and write inside that memory chip and

196
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:02,830
when you switch the other host becomes

197
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,800
active and he has full access to this

198
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,160
same flash memory so this is obviously a

199
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,740
way to exchange data each time you

200
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,920
switch your KVM using sound for

201
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,190
communicating is known for a while it's

202
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,480
exactly what I am doing right now and I

203
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,390
will cite some techniques that are more

204
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,490
related to to air gaps

205
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,530
the first one is google's own which is a

206
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:36,550
service that has been imagined by google

207
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,740
for sharing information between devices

208
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:46,810
by using audio waves and it uses a DTMF

209
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,560
modulation on audible frequencies so the

210
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,810
user is aware that communication is

211
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,980
going on of course this technique can be

212
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,940
transposed to other frequencies and this

213
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,830
gives some examples some works about

214
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,010
using ultrasound to establish a

215
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,110
communication channel between two

216
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,470
entities so here the scenario is that

217
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,890
the sender has two control source an

218
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,370
audio source such as an audio output for

219
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,460
example it can be also the defense speed

220
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,950
and more interestingly it can also be

221
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,140
the emanations from the internal

222
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,700
components this was published by Samir

223
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,930
and he has shown that he was able to by

224
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,750
listening to the acoustical emanations

225
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,720
of the internal components of a machine

226
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,280
to perform crypt analysis on RSI

227
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,680
ciphering and deciphering operations so

228
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,850
what that means is that if the attacker

229
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,950
can control the operations that are

230
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,880
being processed on the machine

231
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,580
you can use that and exploit the

232
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,290
emanations from the internal components

233
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:08,140
to send the data and the receiver has to

234
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,470
control the audio input so it can be

235
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,880
from a microphone or the gyroscope there

236
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,750
has been some research also about that

237
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,650
they used the gyroscope of a smartphone

238
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,410
that was on a table and they have been

239
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:33,080
able to reconstruct the speech data of

240
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,850
the people that were speaking around the

241
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,400
table just by using the the vibrations

242
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,100
it's also possible to use light to to

243
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,670
establish a communication channel I

244
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,860
refer here for example to the again

245
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,950
Shamir and his keynote last year at

246
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,090
blackhat it is depicted here but

247
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,220
basically here the sender has to control

248
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,800
a light source this can be the display

249
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,040
of a computer this can be the LEDs on

250
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,280
the keyboard for example and we can also

251
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,100
imagine controlling smart light bulbs

252
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,460
and the receiver has to control a light

253
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:21,170
sensor some people at ben-gurion

254
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,070
University has proposed a technique for

255
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,290
bridging air gaps by using temperature

256
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,220
as a physical layer to communicate the

257
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,050
proof of concept is called bit whisper

258
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,140
and here the sender controls the

259
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,930
temperature it can be by controlling the

260
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,530
room's heating system for example or

261
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:45,290
what they propose to is was to use the

262
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,930
CPU activity to increase the one

263
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,030
machines temperature and in their

264
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,910
scenario a second machine which was

265
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,360
close enough to the first machine was

266
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,080
able to use one of its many temperature

267
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,089
sensors to monitor the temperature

268
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:04,350
activity and

269
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:08,220
use that to receive information as you

270
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,850
can imagine it's it can take a while to

271
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:16,260
transmit a bit of information but it's

272
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,980
an interesting idea and finally it is

273
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,630
also possible to use radio frequency

274
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,170
waves to communicate here I'm gonna

275
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,470
refer to three works that have been

276
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,930
published in the last two years the

277
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,910
first one is a really interesting is a

278
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:37,400
Fantana and here the idea is to exploit

279
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,220
controllable wires or lines inside the

280
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,900
device and use them as an antenna to

281
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,980
send data so they're proof of concept

282
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,850
was presented at CCC last year I guess

283
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,590
and they showed that by compromising the

284
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,730
firmware of a Cisco phone they were able

285
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:07,470
to modulate an electrical signal on an

286
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,060
unused wire and they used that to

287
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,790
modulate AM and FM signals and to

288
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:20,250
exfiltrate data through the phone air

289
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,550
hopper and gsm am are also research

290
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,160
proof of concepts presented by Ben

291
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,030
Gurion ben-gurion University and they

292
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,790
exploit internal components RF leakage

293
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:41,370
so it's the same idea as tempest if you

294
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,150
know and in their first proof of concept

295
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,910
the air hopper they exploit the leaking

296
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,950
video display emanations to communicate

297
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:57,750
its rebranding of the well-known tempest

298
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,860
for Eliza which was made public in the

299
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,599
early 2000s or I guess I think it's 2001

300
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:12,810
and basically they use the the radio the

301
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:17,000
electromagnetic leakage of the display

302
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,890
they modulate their data on the video

303
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,310
stream that is sent to the display and

304
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,470
in Tampa store Eliza the proposal was to

305
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,350
use amplitude modulation and here in air

306
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,120
hopper what's interesting is that they

307
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,500
modulate in frequency and thus they make

308
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,130
it possible for a considering an

309
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,160
untrusted system as a phone a mobile

310
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,450
phone that is FM radio capable and the

311
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,090
compromised mobile phone is able to

312
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,150
receive the data and exfiltrate the data

313
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:57,380
through the 3G network and finally GSM

314
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,380
AM is the same idea they used the the

315
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,470
electromagnetic leakage that happens

316
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,630
when the CPU accesses the the memory and

317
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,690
they proved that for the specific

318
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,230
equipment that they were testing the

319
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:19,310
leakage was in the GSM frequencies so

320
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,940
they imagined a scenario where a mobile

321
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,550
phone with a custom baseband firmware

322
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,060
was able to receive these emanations

323
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,210
these radio emanations and to exfiltrate

324
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:37,520
them and today we are going to present

325
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,030
you a new technique to send data to an

326
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:44,600
isolated computer by using intentional

327
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,820
electromagnetic interferences and

328
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,910
playing with the targets temperature

329
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:56,380
sensors this is a short summary of the

330
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,070
effectiveness of the different

331
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,460
techniques I presented you but as we

332
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,210
will discussed in the end of the talk

333
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,920
this is just to have an idea because

334
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,820
it's not a reliable way to really

335
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,890
compare the different techniques for

336
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:17,540
communicating and I guess it's your turn

337
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,390
thank you so hello everybody I'm Xiao Qi

338
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,070
I'm going to talk about intentional

339
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,220
electromagnetic interferences and what

340
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,840
what can we do with such

341
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,779
system so basically I will first present

342
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:33,390
you very briefly what electromagnetic

343
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,539
compatibility and information security

344
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:39,179
then I will just provide you the defeat

345
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,559
the official definition of IMI and some

346
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,990
classification of effects induced by IMI

347
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,039
on electronic devices and some summarize

348
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,159
the effects on targeted computer in our

349
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:57,510
lab so basically electromagnetic

350
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,450
compatibility is related to

351
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,059
electromagnetic noise generated by

352
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:05,899
electronic devices also defined as

353
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:09,690
emanations and the susceptibility of

354
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,850
electronic devices when exposed to

355
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:16,500
parasitic field and when so in our case

356
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,640
we are mostly involved in the analysis

357
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,789
of this electromagnetic magnetic noise

358
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:27,059
generated by electronic devices in order

359
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:31,020
to recover possibly the information

360
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,270
processed by the information system so

361
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,029
that that topic is called Tempest you

362
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:37,620
may have heard about the research of

363
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,909
Kuhn in Cambridge so during the last ten

364
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:44,580
years where he was shown that we were

365
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,809
able to recover the computer video

366
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:51,330
screen by analyzing the electromagnetic

367
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:55,289
emanations when going into electronic

368
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:59,190
system we also can estimate or analyze

369
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,190
the electromagnetic combinations on

370
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,049
smart cards and crypto systems so this

371
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:06,120
topic is called side channels attacks

372
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,130
and so thats related to emanations

373
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,960
security and when trying to induce fault

374
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,779
on systems and possibly damage

375
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,399
electronic device using high power

376
00:21:20,399 --> 00:21:23,960
sources we are much more related to

377
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,080
intentional electromagnetic interference

378
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,799
there is also or last paper published

379
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,720
four months ago where we have shown that

380
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,880
we were also able to inject voice

381
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,880
commands into smartphones through by

382
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,190
using electromagnetic hypersensitivity

383
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:47,250
and today we're going to talk about so

384
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,060
corporate channels and when related back

385
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,020
to EMC and enforce security we have the

386
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,570
emanations so that's for data

387
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:02,240
exfiltration and by involving the

388
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,790
susceptibility of electronic devices we

389
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,870
will try to inject data if possible

390
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,540
so I what am I i'ma is the use of

391
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,720
intentional malicious generation of

392
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,520
electromagnetic energy so introducing

393
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,330
noise or signals into electronic devices

394
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,820
thus disrupting confusing or damaging

395
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,120
the system for terrorist or criminal

396
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,270
purposes so it was officially defined at

397
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:35,300
Zurich EMC symposium in 1999 and later

398
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,900
put inside the eg IC standard so here we

399
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,160
have the reference in 2005 so in our

400
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,920
case we wanted to use so high power

401
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,260
sources in order to check if it's

402
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,570
possible to gain access to electronic

403
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:56,360
devices and especially IT systems

404
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,600
so when exposing electronic devices to

405
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,780
parasitic fields you may you may want to

406
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,240
analyze and classify the effects induced

407
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,820
by parasitic field so here this is the

408
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,910
table and the levels provided by dr.

409
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,970
Sabet in 2008 and it defines several

410
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,890
levels of effects induced on systems and

411
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,510
we have been working together during the

412
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,120
last two years in order to to remove the

413
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,820
ambiguity between the unknown effects

414
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,070
that you may have missed during the test

415
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,460
and the no effect level that means that

416
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,110
you are sure that there is no effect on

417
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:40,110
your system so we applied these methods

418
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,020
in the characterization of the

419
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,420
susceptibility of computers and we have

420
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,900
seen that it's really easy to apply

421
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,970
these classifications we will show you

422
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,610
some results a few later but the main

423
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,020
drawbacks we had about this

424
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,990
technique is that it's a high-level

425
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:00,150
methodology and it does not allow

426
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,810
analyzing the effect induced of

427
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,430
electromagnetic perturbations on each

428
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,520
sub component of the system and the

429
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,160
solution we have found is to recursively

430
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,250
apply this technique combined with log

431
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,630
events and to to record them and to

432
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,070
analyze them in real time during

433
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,620
parasitic exposure so that we are able

434
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,860
to analyze the behavior of the system

435
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:30,090
when exposed to parasitic field so what

436
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,910
we did we we put some computers inside

437
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,680
the Faraday cage because we are

438
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,900
generating sometimes large amount of

439
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,530
power and for regulation purpose we have

440
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,930
to do that in a Faraday cage but what we

441
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,030
can do inside it's the same that what we

442
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,710
can do outside the Faraday cage so

443
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:50,760
that's not some limitation of the the

444
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,070
work we have down so we put this

445
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,490
computer and and we had another computer

446
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:00,390
which was connected to this targeted

447
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,840
device and we like USRP so we decided to

448
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,100
generate signals with us Serapis so we

449
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,000
used an antenna for doing radiation

450
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,060
testing and we also put an injection

451
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,100
probe into the pro-- Network in order to

452
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,230
see if we were able to induce

453
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,600
perturbations and also if we were able

454
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,680
to exploit this way of attacking

455
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,650
information system so here we have the

456
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:31,170
main effects on the IT system so we use

457
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,660
USB keyboards and also ps2 keyboard and

458
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,070
by analyzing in real-time the logs on

459
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,870
the computers or running Linux we have

460
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,000
seen that we were able to to induce

461
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,780
folds on the ps2 lines so here you have

462
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,030
a brief overview of what kind of logs we

463
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:51,690
may record we also had some USB links

464
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,880
errors so we have seen that it was able

465
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,880
to detect that some I my problems were

466
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,910
occurring so hits the first line and we

467
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:03,390
also were able to to modify and to

468
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:06,660
corrupt some descriptor inside the the

469
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,270
you in the USB port

470
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:12,220
so that was also an interesting effect

471
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,980
we also monitored the errors on the

472
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,429
internet it is a net link and we have

473
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:22,280
seen that when exposing the the system

474
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,010
to IMI we have shown that we have a lot

475
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,500
of high increase of errors on that

476
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,530
network so we also were able to record

477
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,800
that kind of effect and the computer has

478
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,190
also several temperature sensors and we

479
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,260
wanted to to see if we were able to

480
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,200
disturb such sensors and here you have

481
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,480
an overview of the the recorded the

482
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,450
recording of the temperature of the CPU

483
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,030
temperature sensor in function of the

484
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,860
time and we can see that when exposing

485
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,309
the the IT system we were able to

486
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:57,260
corrupt the data recorded by the system

487
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,380
so you may imagine that if you have some

488
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,480
warnings and some action taken by the

489
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,390
computer like to stop or to reboot due

490
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,470
to an increase of temperature

491
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,170
temperature we may be able to trigger

492
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,370
this by using IMI on the targeted system

493
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:19,520
and based on this we we went a little

494
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,040
bit further and that's this part so how

495
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,140
we explode I my effect in order to set

496
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,200
up a cover channel to inject data into a

497
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,470
computer which was so compromised with a

498
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,990
malware listening to to one or two

499
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:35,929
sensor and so I will show you so the

500
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:39,020
many prophecies in in this for this test

501
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,150
and we will talk about the charge

502
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,010
channel coding and the frame

503
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,620
decomposition we have defined for this

504
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,670
test in fact when the field amplitude

505
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,980
rises we have seen that miss your

506
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,790
temperatures Rises and it's an

507
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,429
instantaneous rising of the temperature

508
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:01,280
so it's directly related to the I am I

509
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,490
am pitch field amplitude and here we

510
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,140
have some results for several

511
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,360
frequencies you have here the

512
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,540
temperature reading error and the

513
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,940
minimum the mean field strength required

514
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:18,800
to induce such reading error and in the

515
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,410
same times as I told you we were able to

516
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,090
record

517
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:26,020
and to get all collateral effects

518
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,510
induced by our sources and we have seen

519
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,480
that frost on frequencies and four high

520
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,090
field amplitude that the fan speed

521
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:38,169
starts to increase and to stop the

522
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:41,620
network interface and also to reboot the

523
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,830
computer and some time also to damage

524
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:49,120
the computer so based on this we wanted

525
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,630
to try to inject some specifically

526
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,870
crafted signal in order to induce some

527
00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:00,190
data into that sensor and so what we had

528
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:03,940
in mind is to define a mask of data that

529
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,470
we use to modulate the continuous wave

530
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,919
signal we generate this signal and check

531
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,919
the temperature the the current

532
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,409
temperature in the computer which is not

533
00:29:17,409 --> 00:29:20,679
the real temperature but just a fault

534
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:22,750
induced on the reading of that

535
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:26,399
temperature so it's really how is that

536
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,320
to disturb the reading of the

537
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,919
temperature at a specific time

538
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,710
so for selling data you may want to

539
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,649
define some robust channel a robust

540
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:40,750
channel and colleague scheme and the

541
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:44,140
first question you may have is how can i

542
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,299
encode my data

543
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:49,320
do I have to define a synchronization or

544
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,600
maybe I don't need that do I have to

545
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,630
check the integrity to correct the day

546
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,610
the corrupted data due to the

547
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,710
propagation path and the coupling the

548
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,870
coupling part and we have seen that

549
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,390
basically the transmission was imposed

550
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:07,240
by the effect of IMI which is the

551
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,970
temperature rating error which imposes

552
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,919
to use a nice car modulation scheme

553
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,049
which is basically an on-off shift

554
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:18,399
keying of the signal in order to define

555
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,580
a robust and current scheme we we can

556
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:25,140
think a long time on that but basically

557
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,640
people during radio communications have

558
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,000
been working for right and we just try

559
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
to define the best way for setting up a

560
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,590
good

561
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:38,340
occasional so the main limitation we had

562
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,549
our the time needed to query the sensor

563
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:44,039
which is not constant the sampling of

564
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:48,630
the temperature has some jitter and we

565
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,360
have see we know as Reggio come

566
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,120
engineers that the Manchester coding

567
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,520
mask clock recovery is easier because

568
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,690
there is a transition between each bit

569
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:03,809
transmitted so that's the the main and

570
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:07,020
coding scheme we defined and the clock

571
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,450
must have a frequency twice higher run

572
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,490
the beach right in order to make it easy

573
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:17,370
that in order that when the beach right

574
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,110
sorry and the bit sequence XOR with the

575
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,200
clock sequence so that the signal is is

576
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,529
self content as it contained the clock

577
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:29,549
sequence as the consequence or the clock

578
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:32,070
is included into that signal and that's

579
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,610
why we use that that scheme the frame we

580
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:38,250
defined his has shown here so we have a

581
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,309
preamble so that the the malicious

582
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:44,330
software is detecting that a command is

583
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:50,159
is under emission in order to have good

584
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,440
autocorrelation function we used the

585
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,110
well-known broker sequence which is also

586
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,669
used in Bluetooth so it's a seven bits

587
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:00,270
seven bit mask

588
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,909
we've prepared it with a zero in order

589
00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:07,140
to have a bit in fact in our frame we

590
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,010
also define the reading of zero and one

591
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,950
based on the current reading temperature

592
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:17,610
value and we we define a mean

593
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,320
temperature sequence in order to check

594
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,289
if the signal is over this mean or below

595
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:24,840
this me so that we can define we can

596
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,590
recover the zero in the one when it's

597
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:32,399
generated and for getting one bit it we

598
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,679
need for measles or disease based on the

599
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:37,110
sampling theorem so we define this frame

600
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,549
decomposition and this is that's

601
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:41,539
incurring scheme and the malicious code

602
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:45,360
should be able to do to decode this kind

603
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,690
of data we are generating

604
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,550
so here we have the result so it's

605
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:54,170
basically the temperature read by the

606
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:57,360
the sensor during parody parasitic

607
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,750
exposure and that's the containing a

608
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,810
command we are sending to the targeted

609
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:11,490
computer we have also seen that when

610
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,520
using the condom with the conducted case

611
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,070
so basically we are connecting the

612
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,620
injection probe to the into the Pro

613
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,690
Network we have seen that we need much

614
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,350
less power than the redheaded case so

615
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,510
that means that we were able to increase

616
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,790
the range between the targeted computer

617
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:33,960
and the source and concerning the bit

618
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,780
rate we expect and we have we have

619
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,730
estimating doing our measurements we

620
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:42,680
were able to send 2.5 bits per second

621
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:47,490
though to switch back to the summary

622
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,740
that shows I show you a little bit

623
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:53,280
earlier our effort is based on a soft

624
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,930
when different radio and low cost

625
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,880
amplifier we are targeting the heat

626
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,120
sensor like beach whisper but in our

627
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,560
case we are exploiting the effects of

628
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,090
electromagnetic interference in order to

629
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:10,199
send data it's for data injection inside

630
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,449
the computer which is not classical in

631
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:16,440
the field of correctional which mostly

632
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,760
focus on the exfiltration of data and

633
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,100
some time also the injection but very

634
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,340
few of them we have seen that the the

635
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,810
distance between the target and the

636
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:32,010
source can be about 5 meters in the

637
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:35,340
rejected case but we were able with less

638
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,600
power to go up to 430 meters and the

639
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:44,310
bitrate is 2.5 so that's let us switch

640
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:47,480
back to the recommendations

641
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:54,659
so now we are going to present you some

642
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,010
recommendations I guess it's more some

643
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:03,150
reasonable thought about the problem so

644
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,870
first we address the administrators and

645
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:10,020
of course we emphasis the necessity to

646
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:13,080
remove any analog or digital i/o

647
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:18,000
interface and we insist on the point

648
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,870
that we have to in this case consider

649
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:27,810
any sensor as an input interface so it's

650
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:31,740
not only focusing on the network

651
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,790
communication interfaces of course try

652
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:38,880
to monitor the remaining ones for

653
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,320
example for the temperature sensor

654
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,120
noticing very fast increases of

655
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,270
temperature is not a realistic case so

656
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,640
it can give a clue that something is

657
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,440
going on on the machine and of course

658
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,330
the recommendations presented here are

659
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:03,920
not adapted to any kind of machines it's

660
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,690
only dedicated to really critical

661
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:10,770
machines so everyone does not need to do

662
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:14,480
that but it has to be thought

663
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,280
accordingly to the risk analysis that

664
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,860
has been made on the considered

665
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,740
computers one question that is

666
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,440
interesting is is the colocalization

667
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,890
with untrusted devices admissible and if

668
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,590
yes what is the range the admissible

669
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:37,890
range to be sure that we are safe and of

670
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,920
course the different tools that are

671
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,200
available to push further the isolation

672
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,540
are dedicated rooms blind rooms

673
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,150
fertilization is also a technology that

674
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:58,920
can be used there exists a lot of power

675
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,790
network filters

676
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:08,200
to filter the the the current that is

677
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,520
passing through the power network and

678
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:16,840
for the sound anechoic chambers and of

679
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,640
course the main point is to educate

680
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,270
educate the users because as we have

681
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,550
seen the main prerequisite for

682
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,530
exploiting this and bypassing air gaps

683
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:30,250
is the primary infection so if we can

684
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,430
limit the probability of primary

685
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:36,730
infection then the these problems are

686
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:41,350
not so big problems so for the users the

687
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,090
main recommendation is to follow the

688
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:48,610
rules and the security policy the air

689
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:52,060
gap robustness the isolation relies on

690
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:56,590
the user behavior and specifically

691
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,440
because of the main constraints that the

692
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:05,470
air gap implies and of course if

693
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:08,400
computer is totally isolated from

694
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,590
untrusted networks it should not be a

695
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:15,400
reason to deceive because it's the best

696
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,340
way to introduce communication channel

697
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:22,300
or to ferberize the the primary

698
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:29,460
infection here are some clues for you

699
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,730
guys maybe that's not the the main

700
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:37,210
points you you you try to find when

701
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,350
analyzing analyzing pieces of malware

702
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:46,930
but if you are interested in in

703
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:50,200
detecting the exploitation of physical

704
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,860
covered channels by malware that's what

705
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,040
you should look for the so first is the

706
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,530
enumeration the discovery of the the

707
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,780
send or receive capabilities of the

708
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,540
targeted machine so the identification

709
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,270
of the sensors and the interfaces that

710
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:11,990
load to send or to receive data and also

711
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,950
physical layer and mac layer

712
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,460
communication protocol routines so the

713
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,799
modulation the detection of the preamble

714
00:39:19,799 --> 00:39:22,740
that Barker sequence for example in our

715
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,859
case the decoding or the encoding of

716
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:29,430
data the error correction codes that can

717
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:32,099
be involved for making the transmission

718
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:35,040
more robust and of course the packet

719
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,619
parsing of frame parsing routines here a

720
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:43,910
little world 2 word to our french

721
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:47,970
researchers that do research for air gap

722
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:52,200
bridging techniques often the results

723
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,290
that are presented and it's the case in

724
00:39:54,290 --> 00:40:00,210
the sheets that we presented here the

725
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:03,750
results are highly related to the test

726
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:06,500
conditions and the proof-of-concept so

727
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,750
the physical medium choices the

728
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,510
transmission choices and party more

729
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,020
particularly the target capabilities so

730
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,599
the the sensitivity of the sensors or

731
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:21,299
the emissivity of the target for example

732
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:26,760
and unfortunately when looking to the

733
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,930
results of the these different research

734
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:34,230
it's really hard to come to a conclusion

735
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:37,200
about the risk and to evaluate and

736
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,730
estimate the risk during a risk analysis

737
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:46,440
so our our points of view is that in

738
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,930
that particular field there is a lack of

739
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:53,369
a common metrics to really reliably and

740
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:55,470
scientifically compare the different

741
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:59,549
techniques that are presented of course

742
00:40:59,549 --> 00:41:01,200
the the range and the bit rate are

743
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,349
really insufficient for example you you

744
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:06,869
never know if the the researchers the

745
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:10,440
made the best choices in a transmission

746
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,470
point of view for the modulation for the

747
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,780
the encoding and so on and maybe the

748
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,550
throughput can be increased

749
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:22,370
so it's really hard to take that into

750
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:26,180
account in risk analysis and I let

751
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,840
chalky finish with the conclusion

752
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,680
so in fact we have shown that we

753
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,420
designed a new technique for command

754
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:39,530
channel for a gap computer Marwar we

755
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,390
also improved the range and the beach

756
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,220
rage with beach weight regarding state

757
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,790
of the art of coverage channels and

758
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,580
another point so that's what we think

759
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,390
about

760
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:53,300
I am I is that smart I am I can be an

761
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,160
efficient attack vector against ice I

762
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,710
guess so this is the second presentation

763
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:03,290
we do about about this as I am I is not

764
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,360
limited to general of services attacks

765
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:11,270
as they were designed to we are able it

766
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,100
is more and more affordable to design

767
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,970
such electromagnetic high purses based

768
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:20,390
on numerous software different ratio we

769
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,940
were able to buy for very very cheap

770
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,660
software different radios and based on

771
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,940
those publications we think that we

772
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,860
should take them into account into risk

773
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:34,340
analysis as we may be able to do very

774
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:43,160
very malicious activities with IMI also

775
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,290
air gap can be really efficient but it's

776
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:49,520
very constraining and fragile and based

777
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,370
on the publication's Josey summarize to

778
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:55,070
you this morning it's still can be

779
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:58,970
bypassed and there is a real active

780
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:01,100
research activities in the world so as

781
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,660
Josie told you about the ben-gurion

782
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,590
University and other guys air gap bypass

783
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:09,050
techniques are going more and more

784
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:11,870
people published in the in the future

785
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:16,700
and the main limitation we can see today

786
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,740
it's that it needs a high AR chakra

787
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,680
profile and that's something interesting

788
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,420
to keep in mind though you have some

789
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,450
references you also are able to found

790
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:32,770
them into in the proceedings

791
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:34,690
thank you very much and if you have any

792
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:37,029
questions you have

793
00:43:37,029 --> 00:43:39,609
our email addresses and thank you again

794
00:43:39,609 --> 00:43:41,200
for your attention if you have any

795
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:50,319
questions well we'll take just one

796
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,789
question so it better be good

797
00:43:51,789 --> 00:43:55,920
I hope so it's an amazing work Thank You

798
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,309
congratulation

799
00:43:57,309 --> 00:43:59,859
have you tried to correct or control the

800
00:43:59,859 --> 00:44:02,740
errors on for example on the USB or a

801
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,680
ps2 in the way to interact with the

802
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,200
computer or maybe a change targeted bits

803
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:18,730
oh we we conceived that the other way we

804
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:24,549
tried to design a tool that would more

805
00:44:24,549 --> 00:44:27,700
or less reliably detect that there is a

806
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,089
an electromagnetic activity around the

807
00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:36,690
target computer by watching these

808
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:41,670
information these log informations so

809
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:44,559
your question was if it was possible to

810
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:48,069
exploit the the other logs the other

811
00:44:48,069 --> 00:44:50,920
effects - yes you had further

812
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,430
communicate and to change bit change

813
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:57,400
bits in the the protocol and now in the

814
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,410
computer alright

815
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:02,740
make sure the on USB or ps2 to control

816
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,010
something that's an interesting research

817
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:09,760
area we may talk about this if you later

818
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,849
when we will remove the mic thank you

819
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:14,770
okay thank you thank you very much thank

820
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:17,250
you thank you
