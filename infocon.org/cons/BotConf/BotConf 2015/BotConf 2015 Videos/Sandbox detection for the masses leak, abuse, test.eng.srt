1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,389
ok the first short talk of the afternoon

2
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:08,280
Zartan Baloche on the sandboxing sandbox

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,450
detection actually you have the floor hi

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,670
everyone you have to know that this is a

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,100
45-minute presentation compressed into

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,830
20 minutes so first I you are seen that

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,930
because we will travel with hyper speed

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,840
this slide is dedicated about cyber to

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,279
cyber Peter cyborg leitner cyber cyber

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,840
and these are the things I have done

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,629
these are my researches but we don't

12
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,640
have time for this this is the company I

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,079
work for and show me your hands how many

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,350
of you try to analyze mother in us never

15
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,680
analyzes sandbox but it fair to run

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,309
hands up ok great how many of you guys

17
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,460
try to have a right mother and try to

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,769
bypass the mother analyzes sandboxes ok

19
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:08,100
great and how many of you tried to

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,320
create a new mother analyzes sandbox

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,979
like the guys from checkpoint ok or how

22
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,490
many of you are into buying a new mother

23
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,220
analyzes sandbox to protect your company

24
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,900
for example ok great so this

25
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,320
presentation is for you as you love know

26
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,770
this the current mother and I see

27
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,020
strengths are that there is static

28
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,329
analysis there is dynamic analysis and

29
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,090
there is manual analyzes the static and

30
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,970
dynamic ones can be automated the manual

31
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,780
cannot be automated it is very easy to

32
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,869
be bite as the static and the dynamic

33
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:57,240
analyzes it is very hard to bite us a

34
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,890
good manual analyst but if there are

35
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,960
400,000 new mother samples every day

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,770
then you can also bypass the manual

37
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,860
analyst so what are my problems with the

38
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,560
malvern Eliza Stein boxes these were

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,110
very great tools in the hands of mavar

40
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,320
analysts and this was just one way of

41
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,110
detecting new unknown matter on the

42
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,330
network but the problem is that nowadays

43
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,150
these sand boxes are sold to companies

44
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,910
and they usually lack the resources

45
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,480
skills or people to know how to

46
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,820
interpret the reports from these magic

47
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,160
sand boxes which say that they will

48
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,800
detect every new advanced persistent

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,220
threats on your network nowadays it is

50
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,340
pretty common to do sandbox detection in

51
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,760
almost every matter but in the past they

52
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,520
have focused way too much on detecting

53
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,050
virtualization systems and kind of good

54
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,660
but i think is right nowadays a little

55
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,320
bit outdated most of the techniques are

56
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,770
flagged as malicious or they are

57
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,049
circumvented or simulated or whatever so

58
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:22,230
these are not the best ways to detect

59
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,450
sandboxes anymore if you write a new

60
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,890
member and in these screenshots on the

61
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,780
left you can see that I have created a

62
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,130
new red sample I have ticked all the

63
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,980
anti analyzes checkboxes on this sunday

64
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,610
on this red sample and I ran it on a

65
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,390
system which was protected by a special

66
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,600
defensive software and this software

67
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,799
tried to emulate the desktop machine as

68
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,370
it is a virtualized environment so first

69
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,370
of all the malware detected is as is

70
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,160
virtualized so it quit so it didn't in

71
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,459
fact deal 30 user workstation and on the

72
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,700
other hand the binary was flagged as

73
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,190
malicious so this is not the best way

74
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,720
nowadays to do sandbox detection so I

75
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,690
have created a new mavar and i have

76
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,918
uploaded it to the publicly available

77
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,599
sandboxes and some of the private ones i

78
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,380
had access to

79
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,380
the my mother can extract information

80
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,260
from these memorizes sandboxes I

81
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,100
implemented both known methods and I

82
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,550
have created new ideas to detect these

83
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,960
sand boxes and the easiest way to

84
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,380
extract data from these navin Isis

85
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,620
sandbox if I have direct HTTP connection

86
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,230
to the internet so I can leak every data

87
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,950
to my server there are some sand boxes

88
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,980
which block direct connection to the

89
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,650
internet but they still try to resolve

90
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,400
the domain names to IP addresses so for

91
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,700
example if my mother tries to connect

92
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,790
microsoft office is installed on this

93
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,170
box dot my domain com and I operate the

94
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,810
DNS server for my domain com I would

95
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,590
wish I can know for sure that on these

96
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,630
sandbox microsoft office was installed

97
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,630
because i get the data through DNS

98
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,200
tunneling and last but not least I can

99
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,900
also use the report whether it's

100
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,960
publicly available or someone who

101
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,540
operates this sandbox can send it to me

102
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,770
and I can hide these information in the

103
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,200
report like creating new files or

104
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,010
something like that but let me show you

105
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,200
it in action how it really looks like

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,090
so here what you can see that i upload

107
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:08,730
my mother to these very good free online

108
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,480
sandbox called mother it uses cuckoo and

109
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,520
it's a really good service i use it time

110
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:22,830
to time and here you can see that my

111
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,500
server is waiting for the new

112
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,280
connections and for example you can see

113
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,520
that this matter and I see sandbox is

114
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,760
using pretty old and small screen

115
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,160
resolution you can see what that for

116
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,450
example it is running on VirtualBox you

117
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,370
can see that it is a Zeon based

118
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,669
processor and so on and so on so you can

119
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:52,080
leak an awful lot of different

120
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,669
information here you can see that the

121
00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:00,180
mouse event was emulated so the terror

122
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,400
between different times the most

123
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,280
position was different and so on and so

124
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,919
on so you can get a lot of interesting

125
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:15,630
data from these sand boxes but when I

126
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:20,070
checked the report for the results of my

127
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:24,450
neighbor I was able to see that where my

128
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,210
mother was connecting by leaking all the

129
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:32,669
data and you can see soon that it was

130
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:35,250
also flagged as malicious because i have

131
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,460
already implemented all known techniques

132
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,340
to detect some boxes and this cuckoo

133
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,800
sandbox was detecting it that i try to

134
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,460
detect it

135
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,139
okay so in the next slides I'm going to

136
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:01,540
show you some of the tricks i have used

137
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,740
in my mother and whenever you see this

138
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,220
red big red thing it means that district

139
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,050
has a good sandbox detection

140
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,150
effectiveness it's a small it's not a

141
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,220
very effective way to detect some boxes

142
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,490
and when you see a trap and it's big it

143
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,009
means that this technique can be easily

144
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:23,710
flagged as malicious or it is already

145
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,139
flagged as malicious in lot of times but

146
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,960
if it's a small trap than us an attacker

147
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,180
know that this is a good way to detect

148
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,580
some boxes because your mother won't be

149
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,940
flagged as malicious the first one was

150
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,339
the screen resolution and here you can

151
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:41,760
see a statistics from a browser

152
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,229
statistics company and as you can see

153
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:47,680
it's around the seven percent of the

154
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,910
users on the internet who are using 1024

155
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,750
square root 768 screen resolution or

156
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,839
lower but let's see the sandboxes

157
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,730
forty-three percent used this kind of

158
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,810
resolution and forty-six percent used

159
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,110
800 600 resolution which is a big

160
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,540
problem but there was even some one

161
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,250
sandbox with 640 and I mean it's they

162
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,470
didn't even try to hide this is another

163
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,709
analyzing sandbox I have checked what

164
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:25,870
kind of software is installed on the

165
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,130
sandbox which is usually not seen on

166
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:33,850
usual user desktops and the best one i

167
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,360
have seen was this we either tools and

168
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,690
the story behind this is that there are

169
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,120
some other which automatically checks

170
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,170
for the presence of vmware tools and the

171
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,510
sandbox developer food that is a great

172
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,930
idea to rename the vmware tools to be

173
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,640
ver tools these are very common

174
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,010
processes you can find on a ver analysis

175
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,279
10 boxes but they are not very common on

176
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,470
user desktops one of my favorite

177
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,310
techniques

178
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,880
is the check for the processor type

179
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,760
because usually people don't care to

180
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,690
fake it and for example if you are an

181
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,000
exploit kit operator you know for sure

182
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,610
that you are targeting desktop users or

183
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,130
notebooks or something like that and if

184
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,210
you see that the processor type is some

185
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,950
eight-core processor or something

186
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,980
specialized for servers like xeon

187
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,440
processors or up their own bonds then

188
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,089
you can be sure that this is not your

189
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,060
target but this is a sandbox and i have

190
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,460
seen some very old processors as well

191
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,980
like in Turpan tube to and into panting

192
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,790
pro i have no idea what that was but

193
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,730
there were some sun boxes which used or

194
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,760
at least fade real desktop processors

195
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,610
like intel atom or inter corepressors it

196
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,310
is again a well known way to detect some

197
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,310
boxes at least among penetration testers

198
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,620
to check for the number of course of the

199
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,710
processor and it turned out that it

200
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,430
works but not every time for example i

201
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,070
have seen one sandbox from ukraine which

202
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,770
used for course or at least it faked it

203
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:29,080
i have also checked for the computer

204
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,170
system and if you see for example box

205
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,660
then you can be sure that this is not a

206
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:40,630
real user workstation and in my research

207
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,970
I have found that almost seventy percent

208
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,760
of these sand boxes were using some kind

209
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,740
of virtualized environment almost 20 was

210
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,470
some which looked like a desktop but I'm

211
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,650
sure they just fade it and around the 14

212
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,290
was something which looked like a server

213
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,670
I have also checked the mouse movement

214
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,040
whether it's simulated that there is a

215
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,290
user moving the mouse during the

216
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,050
analysis and it was pretty shocking to

217
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,050
see that only twenty percent simulated

218
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,660
the most movement and there were some

219
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,230
very basic positions on the screen where

220
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,810
the Mo's was you so

221
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,810
that was kind of shocking i have also

222
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:29,070
checked the memory size because nowadays

223
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,740
i'm not sure that a lot of people use

224
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,660
computers with one gigabyte of memory

225
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,230
you can even start youtube with it but

226
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,200
still an awful lot of sandboxes use the

227
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,980
low amount of memory mostly because of

228
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,410
the effectiveness and if they if you

229
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,230
have to run multiple sandboxes multiple

230
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,089
virtualized environments in parallel

231
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:55,600
then you have to keep short your memory

232
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,180
assignments but again there was still

233
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,180
some good sand boxes which used for

234
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,260
gigabyte of memory just for fun I have

235
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,660
checked for the machine name and I have

236
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,000
found some interesting strings there for

237
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,490
example someone named his sandbox to

238
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,270
sandbox a or Vanek's be more tests well

239
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,580
this is not the best idea but most of

240
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,800
them were quite random this is an actual

241
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,870
real screenshot from one of the never

242
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,110
analyzed Eastern boxes and I want to ask

243
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,920
you to shout some of the tips for me why

244
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,870
this is a material mavar analyzes

245
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:41,339
sandbox and not a user desktop sorry

246
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:48,700
yeah nothing is installed yes louder

247
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,680
please sorry

248
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,290
yeah there is no applications running

249
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:01,630
exactly yeah default background no one

250
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:08,980
uses that yeah it's windows XP yes trash

251
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,950
bin is empty so there are so many things

252
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,700
on this picture again this is another

253
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,890
never analyzes sandbox with debug data

254
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,810
another methanol Isis sandbox with debug

255
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,290
data pretty interesting but when you

256
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,290
look at a real user workstation this is

257
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:34,270
how it looks like actually I stole this

258
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,940
screenshot from the hacked team torrent

259
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,910
file there one of the administrators of

260
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,580
hacking team was hacked and the guy who

261
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,649
attacked them toward the screenshots

262
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:49,420
while he was busy working so if you see

263
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,610
this you can be sure this is a real user

264
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,620
desktop there's no question about this I

265
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,900
have also checked for the number of

266
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,720
flash drives used in the sandboxes

267
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,330
usually it was zero but there were some

268
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,180
cases where only one flash drive has

269
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,520
been used so if you want to detect some

270
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,430
boxes right this way I recommend to set

271
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,339
the trash for 22 because none of the

272
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:18,010
sandboxes have used to flash drives but

273
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,800
I have never seen any user desktop with

274
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,900
only two flash drives used again this is

275
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,490
one of my favorites checking for

276
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,070
printers none of the Sun boxes have

277
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,740
printers installed accept the default

278
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,740
ones like the windows the adobe or the

279
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,950
office ones but all user workstations

280
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,000
and stack stop has a printer I also

281
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,339
checked for the number of recently

282
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:48,790
created or modified files in common

283
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,620
directories like desktop documents

284
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,360
folders AppData temp and so on it was

285
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,260
not a surprise that almost all sandboxes

286
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,440
had really low value on these but if you

287
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,570
check a real user workstation you will

288
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,480
see a lot of recently modified files in

289
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,500
these directories now if you are

290
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,680
implementing all these sandbox detection

291
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,290
techniques in your mother there are at

292
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,510
least four levels where you can do that

293
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,269
the first level is in JavaScript if you

294
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:25,570
are into exploit kit development you can

295
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,579
still check for some things in

296
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:29,410
JavaScript for example the screen

297
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:33,670
resolution you can also make automated

298
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,160
decisions in your mother hard coded

299
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,709
which is good because via the dynamic

300
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:41,709
analysis you won't leak your cnc server

301
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,850
data but again this is not something

302
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,880
super sophisticated so not everything

303
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,850
can be implemented here or you can do

304
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,690
another way that you leaked some data to

305
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,290
your cnc server and the logic on the C&C

306
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,389
server decides whether it's your target

307
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:04,480
or not or last but not least you can eat

308
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,760
for example leaked screenshots to your

309
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,549
C&C server and check three different

310
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:11,919
screenshots whether it is your target or

311
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,589
not but the best approach is to

312
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,619
implement all of these layers and quit

313
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,619
or modify your behavior at the first

314
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:24,429
layer when you detect your sandbox there

315
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:26,949
are also some heart problems for neither

316
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:29,530
analysis sandbox developers for example

317
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:34,210
when it comes to they emulate the slip

318
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,330
functions or not it turned out that in

319
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,030
my key test cases most of the sandbox is

320
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,520
never even tried to emulate the slip

321
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,650
course so if you implement the

322
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,020
four-minute sleep in your mother you

323
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:52,540
will just skip the behavior analysis but

324
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,390
it is very easy to detect whether sleep

325
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,790
is immolated or not for example by

326
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,700
creating new freds and one Fred sleeps

327
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,290
the other creates some heavy

328
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,750
calculations like hashes and based on

329
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,620
which of red finishes of sooner you know

330
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,919
the better sleep is simulated or not and

331
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,540
there is no desktop on the world via

332
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,880
sleepy simulated so it's again for sure

333
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,850
you know that this is a sandbox there is

334
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,770
a solution to solve that called

335
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,490
continuous

336
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,070
unboxing which I don't have time to tell

337
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,140
you how it works but unfortunately it

338
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,920
has own own problems as well another

339
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,320
hard problem is the network connection

340
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,230
whether it's simulated whether there is

341
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,390
a real connection or there is no

342
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,320
connection at all no matter which way

343
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,080
you choose in your sandbox you can be

344
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,750
detected so these are very hard problems

345
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:52,480
and my lessons learned for this

346
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,220
presentation is that if you are neither

347
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,490
writer there are many many ways how you

348
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,370
can bypass static and dynamic analysis

349
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,270
and if you are sandbox developer

350
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,580
especially if you are born selling your

351
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,940
sandbox to customers for a lot of money

352
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,309
then I think you should really try

353
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:16,000
harder because nowadays de level is not

354
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,220
what I would expect from these sand

355
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,190
boxes and if you are on the blue team or

356
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,230
defensive side you should really test

357
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,720
your sandboxes against these anti

358
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,120
steinbach solutions and what I really

359
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,059
recommend to customize your sandboxes so

360
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:33,190
it really matches your desktop

361
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,990
environment so that's all thank you for

362
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,350
your attention

363
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:57,610
we have time just for one question over

364
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,940
there over there I cannot tell you the

365
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,010
question was what is the best sandbox

366
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,950
out there but I can't tell you but if

367
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:11,440
you pay me I can tell you okay well

368
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,539
that's a first try yeah thank you thank

369
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:15,750
you
