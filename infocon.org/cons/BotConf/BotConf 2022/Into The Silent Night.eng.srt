1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
case for three of the presentations

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,000
um

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,200
utah sawabi and yuchitan a bit today

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,599
from japan um so

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,440
to be precise in japan today the

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,200
situation is that uh

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,040
in practice it's very difficult to

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,560
travel

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,720
you have a seven days lockdown when you

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,960
come back etc so

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,640
it's uh it was impossible for their

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,519
company to authorize them to leave

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,960
so they recorded their presentation

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,840
and we have two other talks like this uh

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,440
one this afternoon

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,079
and one tomorrow morning

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,879
uh for the talk this morning uh there

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,200
will be no uh interaction with the

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,879
speakers because they cannot connect

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,520
with us today

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,840
but for the presentation this afternoon

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,360
uh

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,199
and tomorrow morning

24
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,440
we will have a zoom uh connection with

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,079
the the speakers uh to to be able to ask

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,199
questions

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,000
so please bear with us this is just a

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,559
recording but uh it's uh it's the best

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,720
way we we found to uh

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,880
uh to be sure that that you get all the

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,560
other presentations

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,360
so

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,360
hoping that it's okay i'm going to

34
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,040
launch it

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,320
and um

36
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,880
so uh

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,600
silent knight

38
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,320
it's the the new name of z loader

39
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,240
for a number of times

40
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,600
for a number of years actually and uh

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,280
and they've been studying it for some

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,040
time since the end of

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,920
2019 and they wanted to uh share their

44
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,560
work with us

45
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,400
hello everyone

46
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,159
we are entity security holdings

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,439
today

48
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,040
we are going to talk about our system

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,240
and case studies

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,720
the target malware is z loader

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,840
this is our motivation and goal

52
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,200
our motivation is to track c loaded c

53
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,880
two servers

54
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,479
however tracking the city servers is

55
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,680
challenging

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,160
because seal order uses domain

57
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,640
generation algorithm

58
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,520
called

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,000
dca

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,760
to accomplish it

61
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,200
we constructed a system and we observed

62
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,480
data

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,679
from this system

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,040
first this system collects zero order

65
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,560
samples

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,200
and the base configs

67
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,080
then

68
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,720
it tracks the city servers

69
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,640
and collects information from the

70
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,480
servers

71
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,239
finally we analyze the data

72
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,560
and generate threat intelligence

73
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,560
we are going to introduce the case

74
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,360
studies in this presentation later

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,959
and then discuss the result

76
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,920
before explaining about our system

77
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,280
we introduce about silent knight

78
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,640
satellite

79
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,120
is a new variant of sea lorder

80
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,480
of z loader

81
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,440
is a module banking trojan

82
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,159
from this family

83
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,680
and the

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,799
silent knight is a final phase malware

85
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,640
by explicate

86
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,480
fake software

87
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,159
public milestone

88
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,480
and so on

89
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,799
it has been used some dac campaigns

90
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,840
to

91
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,360
to communicate its c2 servers

92
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,920
this malware uses hardcoded urls

93
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,640
in its base config

94
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,080
and also

95
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,560
it uses dga

96
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,280
domain generation algorithm

97
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,040
to connect the c to servers

98
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,959
the loader calculates the dj domains

99
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,920
with the rc4 key and the base config

100
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,159
this table

101
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,238
shows the contents of this config

102
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,000
as you can see here

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,759
it contains

104
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,360
c2 servers url

105
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,479
and an rc4 key

106
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,159
to generate dga domain

107
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,960
in the next slide

108
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,639
we talk about

109
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,199
c2 server

110
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,400
these are the contents

111
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,240
of the

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,560
z loaders city domain server

113
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,880
but in this presentation

114
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,160
we focus on the three contents

115
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,960
cp.php

116
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,280
a dot php

117
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,400
and logs directly

118
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,479
first

119
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,520
cp.php is a login page to access the

120
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,680
control panel

121
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,560
next

122
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,639
gate.php is a file for the box to start

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,840
and

124
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,880
locks directory

125
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,240
there are logs

126
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,120
about the control panel

127
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,639
for this study

128
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,919
we used

129
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,240
nv.log

130
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,199
to check the trend of the attack cases

131
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,919
this service law contains information

132
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,240
about infected hosts

133
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,880
as shown here

134
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,160
now from here we're going to explain

135
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,199
about our system

136
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,880
this is our

137
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,639
this is our

138
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,919
systems overview

139
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,080
first

140
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,880
collect our samples

141
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,240
from the sample sharing sites shown here

142
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,360
next

143
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,759
extract base config

144
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,440
using the online sandbox service

145
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,759
here

146
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,240
then

147
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,639
dji calculated

148
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,080
using rc4 key from extracted base config

149
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,680
and finally

150
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,720
collect the log

151
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,720
from running cto servers

152
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,039
here

153
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,759
our system

154
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,479
collects still loaded samples from these

155
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,960
sites

156
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,360
here

157
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,599
aristotle and iran

158
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,560
and troyage

159
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,479
the system

160
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,919
searches for the latest smaller samples

161
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,919
based on the tags z loader

162
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,560
after collecting sound groups after

163
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,400
collecting the samples

164
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,240
our system will extract the base configs

165
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,960
using the online sandbox site

166
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,240
our system

167
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,440
uses triage

168
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,880
because triage provides a

169
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,919
service

170
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,599
to extract config files

171
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,440
when you upload malware samples

172
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,319
the extraction will be completed

173
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,639
automatically

174
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,360
and the extracted base config is like

175
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,360
this

176
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,759
as you can see here faceconfig have the

177
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,280
see the servers url

178
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,919
here

179
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,960
and on our c4k value

180
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,280
here

181
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,479
the next step

182
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,080
we're going to use the rc4 key

183
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,800
from the base config

184
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,759
uh after extracting base config value

185
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,120
values

186
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,519
our system calculates the

187
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,479
zero does these year domains

188
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,200
the domain generation algorithm has four

189
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,440
characteristics

190
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,640
first

191
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,839
input values are date

192
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,399
and analysis for key

193
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,600
second

194
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,640
generate

195
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,040
32 domains per

196
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,080
these inputs

197
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,360
third

198
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,320
using randomized 20 characters alphabet

199
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,399
string

200
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,519
for the domains

201
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,040
and

202
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,360
top level domain is dot com

203
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,519
then after

204
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,839
calculating the domain our system

205
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,680
collects log

206
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,880
from the

207
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,160
running cd servers

208
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,720
so

209
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,959
from here we are going to talk about the

210
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,360
data results

211
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,200
created by our system

212
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,440
we analyzed the

213
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,279
453

214
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,560
samples

215
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,800
and extracted 22 rc4 keys

216
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,519
from this sample

217
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,600
and we will observe the number of

218
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,519
infection and infection rates

219
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,040
by country

220
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,160
for six month things

221
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,399
first march 2021

222
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,920
the graph on the left shows the number

223
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,279
of infected costs

224
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,079
as you can see here

225
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,200
the number

226
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,079
intentionally increased

227
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,760
in september here

228
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,440
in the same period

229
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,320
when you attack chain to infect the

230
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,880
water by a fake software was reported

231
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,079
so we assume we assume that

232
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,959
this neon chain affects the number of

233
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,079
infected hearts

234
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,440
and the graph on the right shows the

235
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,120
eviction rates by country

236
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,760
most of the infected costs

237
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,120
were in the u.s during the observation

238
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,720
period

239
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,880
however

240
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,200
according to the results

241
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,440
we observed that the

242
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,040
infected

243
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,800
horse

244
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,360
some infected hearts

245
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,320
were from other countries

246
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,399
and from here we are going to introduce

247
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,360
case studies

248
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,160
before that we are going to talk about

249
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,560
the investigation period

250
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,880
for the case studies

251
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,480
we use the generated dj domains

252
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
for the case studies

253
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,399
and as we can

254
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,600
and as we explained before

255
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,480
sea lords dg domain

256
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,480
is generated by an rlc for key

257
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,240
in a base config

258
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,040
and update

259
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,639
we used 22 extracted keys

260
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,560
and a specific date

261
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,279
30th september 2021

262
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,959
but we generated the dj domains not only

263
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,720
that date

264
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,639
but also before and after the

265
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,399
investigation gate date

266
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,440
as shown here

267
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,399
was that 90 days as an

268
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,600
investigation period

269
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,079
and we divided this barrier into two

270
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,600
part

271
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,839
the first part

272
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,320
is past 60 days

273
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,920
from the investigation date

274
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,399
and second part

275
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,639
is until 30 days

276
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,120
later from the investigation date

277
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,920
this is the first case study

278
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,320
in this case study we are talking about

279
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,680
the

280
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,600
relation

281
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,880
between

282
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,399
activities

283
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,600
and the rc4 keys

284
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,720
we resolved the

285
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,519
digit domains

286
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,959
generated by 22 rc4 keys

287
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,639
and

288
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,839
we found that eight keys could generate

289
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,600
the active dj domains

290
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,079
the keys are shown on the right side of

291
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,040
this slide

292
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,360
here

293
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,680
face config contains a port id

294
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,600
accounting id

295
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,199
and all simple key

296
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,680
so it can be said

297
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,920
if the dc domains generated by the rc4

298
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,040
key

299
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,160
can be resolved

300
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,600
the attack campaign

301
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,639
can be active

302
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,160
here is the second

303
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,720
case study

304
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,760
in this case study we focused on

305
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,639
timeline based domain acquisition rate

306
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,560
in the previous slide

307
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,040
we said that eight keys

308
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,680
could generate the valid digit domains

309
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,639
balik

310
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,920
means the

311
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,720
domain could be resolved

312
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,959
in the investigation period

313
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,480
we investigated if the attackers had

314
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,160
acquired

315
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,480
the dj domains

316
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,279
for the future period

317
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,399
the results are shown here on the right

318
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,399
side

319
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,360
here

320
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,920
this table

321
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,600
the acquisition rate

322
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,160
for the future date

323
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,639
was not so much

324
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,440
shown here

325
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,040
less than 40 percent

326
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,560
but existed

327
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,518
as you can see here

328
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,279
especially

329
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,279
g a

330
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,360
generated

331
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,680
the domain

332
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,239
for months for one month later

333
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
this indicates

334
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,320
that the attackers tend to get the dc

335
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,959
domains in advance

336
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,440
and prepare a resolvable environment

337
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
therefore

338
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,639
resolving the dc domain names that will

339
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,199
be used in the future

340
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,639
can trace the future activity of the

341
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,800
over particular that campaign

342
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,639
this is the third third case study

343
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,440
as we explained before

344
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,360
sea loader generated 32 domains per day

345
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,680
if the loader cannot connect to a

346
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,759
generated domain

347
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,440
it will generate

348
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,360
and connect

349
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,399
to

350
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,560
another

351
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,759
domain

352
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,199
up to the

353
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,160
30 second 30 second domain

354
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,519
in this case study we investigated how

355
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,920
many domains we could resolve

356
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,079
as a result

357
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,880
shown here

358
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,599
here

359
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,959
the first

360
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,240
the second

361
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,919
and the third

362
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,359
domain

363
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,399
can be result

364
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,000
this means that the attackers used only

365
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,119
a part of the generated dj domains

366
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,320
and sock

367
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,160
and scissors can use these results

368
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,039
to monitor the sql servers effectively

369
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,039
they don't need to add

370
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,360
all of the easier domains into their

371
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,360
blacklists

372
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,719
here is wrap up

373
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,559
today we talked about tracking the

374
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,440
loader especially about its dji domains

375
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,480
we proposed a system

376
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,240
that automatically traces the loaded c2

377
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,000
server

378
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,799
this system collects samples

379
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,960
analyzes the configuration data

380
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,640
and calculates

381
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,400
these yet domains

382
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,360
that we

383
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,120
there will be

384
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,160
used

385
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,120
after infection

386
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,880
this system

387
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,120
can catch

388
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,039
attackers platform

389
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,880
even if new zealander samples appear

390
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,400
or see the server's ip addresses change

391
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,080
in addition

392
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,799
we can check the attack trend

393
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,280
to correct the log

394
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,799
log files

395
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,760
about the infected host

396
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,360
from the doctor's servers

397
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,280
we investigated whether the dj domains

398
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,879
could be resolved or not

399
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,120
we discussed the results showed that the

400
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,280
acquisition rate

401
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,120
of the domain name was biased

402
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,120
from these results

403
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,440
we discussed

404
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,360
that it is possible to predict the trend

405
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,840
of attacking pains

406
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,039
and the effective way to manage

407
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,600
blacklist

408
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,360
uh this is just additional information

409
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,200
about z loader

410
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,799
on 13th

411
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,120
april 2022

412
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,000
microsoft reported that

413
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,720
they disrupted a similar

414
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,360
botnet

415
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,160
so

416
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,320
this can be your turning point for

417
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,600
researching g folder

418
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,960
that brings us uh

419
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,840
to the end of our

420
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,720
presentation thank you for your

421
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,200
attention

422
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,640
okay

423
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,840
i won't take any questions

424
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,200
um but actually if you if you put uh

425
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,360
questions inside the the feedback form

426
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,440
on the the scad we will forward them to

427
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,400
uh

428
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,400
uh yuichi and utah and uh and

429
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,080
they'll come back to you

430
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,039
okay

431
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,760
is that okay
