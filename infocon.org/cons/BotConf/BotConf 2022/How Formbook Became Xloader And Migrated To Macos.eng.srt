1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,600
video and we'll be able to

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,759
ask questions and interact with the the

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,440
speakers

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,559
is everything

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,519
all right with you guys in the room

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,759
yeah

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,840
okay

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,920
alex don't worry you you will hear the

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,520
questions normally

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,240
but

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,320
if needed we will repeat them so first

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,439
we put the video and then you uh and you

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,039
can watch the video on youtube it's

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,679
easier

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,079
okay

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,960
hi everyone this is a tactile top

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,520
prevalent malware migrates to my quiz or

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,440
the story how from book turned into

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,039
xlover

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,920
first of all let us introduce ourselves

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,239
my name is ramon and my colleague is

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,360
alex a

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,280
we are malware researchers from

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,120
checkpoint

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,920
this talk is divided into six chapters

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,719
we start with an overview of the malware

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,959
then we speak about important milestones

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,280
in the malware lifecycle

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,880
in the third chapter we get our hands

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,479
dirty with form book analysis we

31
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,560
conducted four years ago

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,080
and discussed the complications we

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,600
encountered

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,680
then we speak about excluder analysis we

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,320
conducted a year ago and compare it to

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,759
form book

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,600
in the fifth chapter we speak about

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,680
network infrastructure and discuss its

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,400
organization as a final touch we

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,079
describe the exploder version for macos

41
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,159
and now let's start with an overview of

42
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,759
the malware

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,159
phonebook can be described as banker and

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,159
distiller which is targeting more than

45
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,720
100 different applications

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,040
though it's simple in the description it

47
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,320
is very sophisticated under the hood

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,159
form book is very high demand malware

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,399
with a lifespan of 6 years and more than

50
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,560
3 thousand campaigns

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,960
forum book reached its peak in december

52
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,079
2020 when it was included into the top 3

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,000
malware prevalence list and was

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,320
targeting 4 percent of organizations

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,079
worldwide

56
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,239
more than 100 countries were attacked by

57
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,280
forum book in the last 12 months

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,599
with india and ecuador constituting

59
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,560
one-fourth of all the victims worldwide

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,040
usa is on the third place with seven

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,480
percent of victims around the world

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,840
now new horizons opened up with a newly

63
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,680
developed branch of form book which is

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,800
called xloader xloder is able to target

65
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,760
macos along with windows

66
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,160
which makes itself significant milestone

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,319
in malware evolution process for this

68
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,359
reason alone

69
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,840
and now after we got ourselves familiar

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,160
with the malware let's get some facts

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,879
from its history

72
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,120
forum book was first spotted in the wild

73
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,519
in january 2016.

74
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,680
just one month later form books started

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,640
to be sold under underground four

76
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,760
october 2017 form book sales stopped

77
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,680
abruptly and we will get to this fact a

78
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,120
bit later

79
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,080
in may 2018 formbox oscar made his last

80
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,760
post on their underground forum

81
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,599
vanishing into shadows

82
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,640
however its activity has not stopped

83
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,360
in october 2020 xloder started to be

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,519
sold under underground form

85
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,799
as indicated by x-loaders seller

86
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,280
formbox also contributed a lot to the

87
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,360
development of x-loader

88
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,280
however two malware are different

89
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,040
and now it's time to speak about selling

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,239
schemes of two malware and compare them

91
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,159
forum book was offered for quite

92
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,239
affordable prices but the most

93
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,920
interesting option was the possibility

94
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,519
to obtain panel source code to be

95
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,760
deployed on the customer's own domain

96
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,000
speaking about xloader we still see the

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,480
affordable prices but there is no option

98
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,519
of getting the panel source code

99
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,680
so if we compare the selling themes of

100
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,760
two malware we will notice

101
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,400
only one but important difference

102
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,879
no source code of anything is available

103
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,920
for sale anymore

104
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,920
and now let's get back to the event of

105
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,959
stopping for book sales as stated by

106
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,959
form book saucer form book was meant to

107
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,199
be a simple spyware but customers

108
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,880
started using it for massive spam

109
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,240
campaigns

110
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,720
that's why form book sales were stopped

111
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,199
and users involved into such activity

112
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,600
were banned as side note we have to

113
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
mention that phone book saucer and

114
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,479
excluder seller are different avatars

115
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,199
and now we have two facts form book

116
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,600
sales stopped index order selling seemed

117
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,800
changed

118
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
and these two events may be actually

119
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,479
connected

120
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,960
we discovered formbox oscar email and

121
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,720
analyzed it for connections with

122
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,759
formbooks campaigns and domains

123
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,160
we found three campaigns and 11 domains

124
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,280
that have connections with this email

125
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,960
this led us to the conclusion that

126
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
frombox usage in massive spam campaigns

127
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,280
interfered with the author's interests

128
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,280
as such activity increased the

129
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,440
possibility of form book being detected

130
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,120
by the antivirus vendors

131
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,440
we detected an individual activity of

132
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,960
form book samples linked to these

133
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,080
campaigns in 2020 three years after

134
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,400
forum book sales were a stop

135
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,800
and this fact actually supports our

136
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,360
conclusion

137
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
let's speak about form book analysis we

138
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,639
conducted four years ago and discussed

139
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,479
the complications we encountered

140
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,280
but first let's start with the approach

141
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,360
we usually use for malware analysis

142
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,800
before we get to the nitty gritty

143
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,120
details

144
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,199
we start the analysis with checking used

145
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,360
strings and function calls

146
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,280
then with the help of cross references

147
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,440
to these key pieces we reconstruct the

148
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,000
logic of the application

149
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
however in the case of form book the

150
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
whole process is not unfolding that

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,160
simply when we check the top with

152
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
functions we don't see a single function

153
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,520
there

154
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,120
just like no function is being called

155
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,639
inside which is of course not true

156
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,160
after digging deeper we see the

157
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
mechanism of how the functions are

158
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,360
called

159
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,120
hash values are passed to the resolution

160
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
function and only then the target

161
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,199
function is called

162
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,120
and strings don't make the analysis

163
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,800
easier as they are present only in an

164
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,319
affordable form

165
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,240
most of the strings are encrypted and we

166
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,759
can see them

167
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,199
if we check

168
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,720
if there are any meaningful strings

169
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,520
inside at all we will see these

170
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,360
and this is of course not informative at

171
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,440
all

172
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
we discovered quite a few cryptographic

173
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,600
algorithms inside which are used both

174
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,360
for internal encryption and network

175
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,080
communication

176
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,919
for persistence formbook creates a

177
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,680
random directory

178
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,720
with a random executable name there

179
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,120
the malware uses random directory with

180
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,639
random file names

181
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,199
to store stolen data which will be later

182
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,240
sent to the server

183
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,880
so as we have just seen in brief form

184
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,039
book can be described in just two words

185
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,680
a position everywhere

186
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,520
still we needed to analyze this piece of

187
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,400
malware

188
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,360
and so

189
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,800
despite all the obstacles and

190
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,960
complications we managed to analyze it

191
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,280
with the help of the dedicated tools and

192
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,759
patients

193
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,840
we managed to decrypt

194
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,479
key strings used inside the malware and

195
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,160
reconstruct cross-references to

196
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,400
understand what are the places where the

197
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,039
strings are used

198
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,759
we were also able to reveal the key

199
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,240
functions used inside and understand

200
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,840
from where they are used

201
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,840
we have completely reconstructed the

202
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,319
form book execution flow and here is the

203
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,319
theme

204
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,160
it all starts with the dropper which

205
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,800
unpacks the malware at this stage the

206
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,599
equations are checked for the first time

207
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,759
then the first injection to the explorer

208
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,000
process is performed

209
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,080
after this step the malware makes an

210
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,639
injection to a random system process

211
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,160
the evasions are checked inside this

212
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,120
process for the second time

213
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,599
also at this step the privileges are

214
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,800
adjusted and the persistence is set up

215
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,560
then the injection to the explorer

216
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,240
process is performed for the second time

217
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,560
only at this point is the data grabbed

218
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,160
and the communication with the command

219
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,520
and control server established

220
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,958
speaking about evasion techniques

221
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,958
formbook implements a bunch of them

222
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,640
first one is timing checks via a

223
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,958
dedicated cpu instruction

224
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,000
the debug port is checked next form book

225
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,159
makes a snapshot of running processes

226
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,160
and checks if any of them belong to the

227
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,080
sandboxes

228
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,920
the same process is repeated for

229
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,000
particular executable names that are

230
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,480
usually used in sandboxes

231
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,120
wormbook also checks paths of loaded

232
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,399
modules

233
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,399
and as a final touch

234
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,040
a username

235
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,880
a sophisticated technique implemented

236
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,200
inside the malware is mapping of its own

237
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,360
ntdl copy

238
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,680
this trick renders all the hooks and api

239
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,920
monitors useless even when they try to

240
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,080
intercept the lowest function calls in

241
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,720
user mode

242
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,279
during form book investigation we found

243
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,519
a slight weakness among all the traps it

244
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,399
has prepared for the researchers

245
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,080
chromebook creates mutex during the

246
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,480
execution to prevent running of multiple

247
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,320
copies

248
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,560
this mutex name depends on the username

249
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,480
and is the same on the same machine no

250
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,440
matter how many launches we made

251
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,040
for us it meant that when form book

252
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,959
samples were emulated in virus totals

253
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,080
and boxes

254
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,399
mutex names were always the same in the

255
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,839
same sandboxes

256
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,480
we created a database of mutex names and

257
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,959
counter to different sandboxes

258
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,880
and this greatly assisted us in

259
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,040
uncovering more samples and tracking new

260
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
ones

261
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,200
speaking about network infrastructure

262
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
although we have implemented a network

263
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,959
communication protocol we have not

264
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,959
discovered any live comment and control

265
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,200
servers as none of them responded to our

266
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,600
requests

267
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,360
we saw this course of events as a

268
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
development opportunity for the batch

269
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,519
analysis solutions that could assist us

270
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,200
greatly and process a lot of samples

271
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,279
automatically extract indicators from

272
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,600
there and help us create a more complete

273
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,800
picture of the analyze malware

274
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,720
and this is where the exodus story

275
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,279
starts i'm now giving the microphone and

276
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,079
the stage to alexei

277
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,519
thank you roman

278
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,680
in the next part of our presentation we

279
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,279
will tell you about the form books

280
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,480
rebirth under the new name xlr

281
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,720
when we saw exploder ads for the first

282
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,640
time we thought that it was a completely

283
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,880
new malware it was advertised as a

284
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
cross-platform botnet with infostiller

285
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,320
functionality

286
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,720
we tried to find xlr samples but we

287
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
couldn't because we didn't know how to

288
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,680
search

289
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,600
in fact at the time we already had a

290
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,680
large number of exploder samples at our

291
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,839
disposal

292
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,000
but we thought it was a new version of

293
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,240
form book because the samples are very

294
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
similar and exploder was detected as

295
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,000
firm book in our systems

296
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,640
later on we found specific signatures

297
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,720
that allowed us to update our scripts to

298
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,320
automatically distinguish between

299
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,880
xloader and formbook and even extract

300
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
the malware version encryption keys and

301
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,079
other useful data from samples

302
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,000
exploder shares their form books code

303
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,519
base and they have many similar

304
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,120
functions as you can see on this

305
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,839
screenshot from iodine diaphragm

306
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,519
they also use the same protection

307
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,480
methods

308
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,320
the most important pieces of malware

309
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
data in both form book and excluder are

310
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,040
stored encrypted in special buffers

311
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,959
the buffers are designed to look like a

312
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,959
valid function code with a prolog and

313
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,519
the return instruction at the end

314
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,600
each encrypted buffer is preceded by a

315
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,000
small function that is used to access

316
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,279
the buffer

317
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,959
some of the encrypted buffers contain

318
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,639
data while other buffers contain

319
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,959
decryption keys

320
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,040
the cnc communication protocol also

321
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,200
appeared to be very similar but slightly

322
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,040
changed in x-loader

323
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,720
exploder implements an additional

324
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,720
encryption layer using the key stored in

325
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,399
the malware configuration which is

326
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,240
unique for each campaign

327
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,560
therefore it's impossible to decrypt xlr

328
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,639
network traffic without analyzing the

329
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,560
sample

330
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,480
when we learned how to decrypt the data

331
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,120
in samples decrypt communication we were

332
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,680
able to develop automation for analyzing

333
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,880
thousands of xlr and for book samples

334
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,639
the samples are emulated in several

335
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,760
sandboxes we use them to extract memory

336
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,959
dumps while the malware is running

337
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,120
this allows us to get unpacked samples

338
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,079
regardless of the used packer or crypter

339
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,000
the produced memory dumps

340
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,600
are processed by the malware

341
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
configuration extractors

342
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,279
all the data

343
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,600
extracted from samples is stored in a

344
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,440
single database so called mwdb

345
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,160
and the entire process is orchestrated

346
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,920
by the open source carton system

347
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,440
during 2021 and 2022 in our system we

348
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,320
processed more than 20 000 form book and

349
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,959
exploder samples and extracted more than

350
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,639
4 000 unique malware configurations

351
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,959
the data we extract contain the list of

352
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,399
accessed domains

353
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,720
campaign name malware version and

354
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,120
encryption keys

355
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,440
we have collected a lot of data but our

356
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,160
goal was to find real synthesis servers

357
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,000
to know how effectively protect our

358
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,360
customers

359
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,480
and this appeared to be really difficult

360
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,959
now we will tell you why

361
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,279
the malware creators sell other cyber

362
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,000
criminals access to their servers along

363
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
with the malware binary however

364
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,720
malicious servers remain invisible for a

365
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,880
very long time

366
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,639
first of all this happens because the

367
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,040
malware disguises its communication

368
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,120
by directing most of its traffic to more

369
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,079
than 100 000 of legitimate servers

370
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,360
and if

371
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,839
and it may seem that there is no way to

372
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,680
distinguish a malicious server from a

373
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,959
legitimate one accessed by the malware

374
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,120
let's first take a look at how the form

375
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,519
book since infrastructure works

376
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,760
when you run form book it decrypts its

377
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,399
configuration which contains a list of

378
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,680
64 domain names and one url

379
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,560
the malware randomly selects 16 of 64

380
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,399
domains from the list

381
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,839
one of them is replaced with the main

382
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,760
domain and the selected 16 domains are

383
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,639
used for cnc communication

384
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,880
the malware sends checking requests to

385
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
all the selected endpoints

386
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,639
and the only situation where the

387
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,160
response from the server is 200 okay is

388
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,240
where the bookmaster issues a comment

389
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,199
for a bot however a legitimate http

390
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,240
server may also reply with 200 okay to

391
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,480
annex loader request

392
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,199
usually since c server replies with 404

393
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,760
not found error page the same error you

394
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,000
receive from any other websites when you

395
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,360
try to access a wrong path

396
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,760
this all was related to phonebook but

397
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,519
xloader configuration have the same

398
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,160
structure one encrypted buffer contains

399
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,639
the main url another encrypted buffer

400
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,920
contains a list of 64 domains so what

401
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,680
are the 64 domain names from the

402
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,440
configuration

403
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,160
many of them look totally legit

404
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,240
they are just registered at different

405
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,279
time periods by different entities and

406
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,600
most of them return 404 error when

407
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,839
malware communicates them at first

408
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,320
glance we didn't see any overlap in this

409
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,040
list between samples

410
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,600
for for book researchers uh supposed

411
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,519
that these domains are decoys and the

412
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,759
only one from the main url is the

413
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,399
address of a real cnc server

414
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,959
this was really true for firm book and

415
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,800
we used to think that this works the

416
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,360
same way for exploder with all the facts

417
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,120
mentioned before this assumption looks

418
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,920
really reasonable however two effects

419
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,519
made us doubt

420
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,040
the main domain

421
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,279
from each configuration appears only

422
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,279
once and don't overlap between

423
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,880
configurations

424
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,120
and some of the websites pointed by

425
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,800
these domains looked totally legit

426
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,880
when we compared thousands of exploder

427
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,240
configurations we found an anomaly

428
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,639
we found several domains that appear in

429
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,959
the list of 64 domains in different

430
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,519
configurations multiple times

431
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,360
we collected as much as possible such

432
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,680
domain names and tried to get more data

433
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,560
about them what we found out

434
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,959
exactly one such domain is contained in

435
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,120
every exploder configuration

436
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,199
and all the domains registered at the

437
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,680
same registrar

438
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,240
also the domains registered less than a

439
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,720
year ago and hosted at the same hosting

440
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,519
in a closed ip range

441
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,360
and one more important thing

442
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,600
if you try to open a root path on each

443
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,759
of the hosts it replies with the page

444
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,560
that looks like an empty open directory

445
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,480
we believe that they are real cnc

446
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,480
servers

447
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,280
now

448
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,919
if we find the entry point to the cnc

449
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,880
panel on the servers this will confirm

450
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,520
our assumption

451
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,679
we assumed that xloader panel should

452
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,199
also share

453
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,439
some code with the form book panel

454
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,119
therefore we took the leaked form books

455
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,280
panel source code to see how it should

456
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,000
be accessed well it appeared that we

457
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
should use a path containing the

458
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,120
campaign id and use a valid account name

459
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,320
as an argument for index.php

460
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,880
if we enter a wrong account name the

461
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,160
panel generates 404 error page

462
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
while testing the form book panel in our

463
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,080
local web server

464
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,480
we were glad to find that the error

465
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,840
page generated by the php script differs

466
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,919
from the page generated by the server

467
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,120
itself

468
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,720
we found the same behavior on the

469
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,080
supposed exploder cnc servers

470
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,320
unfortunately after we published our

471
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,200
findings the malware creators fixed this

472
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,440
issue

473
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,840
well one step is left to finally prove

474
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,240
that we found the real census servers we

475
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,559
need to find or guess a valid account

476
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,039
name to see the cnc panel login form

477
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,760
instead of 404 error page

478
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,840
but how to do that

479
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,240
we came up with the following trick

480
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,160
we have collected the nicknames of hack

481
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,640
forms users who contacted exlauder

482
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,679
sellers

483
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,400
then we tried to access the supposed cnc

484
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,559
servers by domain names from the

485
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,840
collected list

486
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,080
and using the known campaign ids

487
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,480
extracted from exploder samples

488
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,280
and the collected nicknames

489
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,280
after a few minutes we got lucky to find

490
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,679
an active account name and we saw the

491
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,400
xloder login page this was really great

492
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,160
success

493
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,120
using the nickname we also found an open

494
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,280
directory containing the panel scripts

495
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,639
and static files

496
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,760
but wait we told you that 16 of 64

497
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,160
domains are selected randomly one of

498
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,640
them is replaced with the main domain

499
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,799
which is also

500
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,280
appeared to be a decoy as we have just

501
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,400
seen

502
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,720
therefore the probability of the event

503
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,520
when cnc server appears in the list of

504
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,640
16 selected domains should be less than

505
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,320
25

506
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,440
really

507
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,520
this is confusing because this logic

508
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,160
significantly reduces the reliability of

509
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,840
the botnet

510
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,160
but actually we were wrong

511
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
we decided to emulate the sample in a

512
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,480
sandbox and we were surprised first of

513
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,280
all we saw requests only to 15 domains

514
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,360
in the network traffic instead of

515
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,679
expected 16.

516
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,000
and after more than 30 emulations we

517
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,919
haven't seen the expected domain in the

518
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,720
network traffic at all

519
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,400
it was a time to investigate how

520
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,200
exlauder creates a list of 16 domains it

521
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,280
wasn't easy because the part of the code

522
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,520
which is responsible for this logic is

523
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,080
additionally encrypted in the malware

524
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,640
and you can find it decrypted only when

525
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,440
it runs injected into a system process

526
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,240
it appears that uh when xlr creates a

527
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,400
list of 16 domains two of them are

528
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,720
replaced one with the main domain which

529
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,039
is actually another decoy and the second

530
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,840
with the real cnc domain which is hidden

531
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,720
among

532
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,000
63 decoys

533
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,679
the code on this on the screenshot

534
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,440
explains why we didn't see the

535
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,520
communication with the real cnc domain

536
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,240
in the sandbox the first six attempts to

537
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,039
connect the real cnc server are skipped

538
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,120
x-loader uses delays of 5 seconds

539
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,440
between connection attempts therefore

540
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,760
the first connection attempt to the real

541
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,600
cnc server is performed after

542
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,240
approximately from 8 to 10 minutes we

543
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,480
didn't see them in a sandbox because the

544
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,640
emulation timeout was less than five

545
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,039
minutes

546
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,679
the domain name selection scheme for cnc

547
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,760
lookup is as follows

548
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,520
the malware accesses

549
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,080
14 random decoy domains one special

550
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,960
decoy domain and only after from 8 to 10

551
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,039
minutes it accesses the real cnc server

552
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,280
if we run the malware in a sandbox for

553
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,360
10 minutes we see that

554
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,760
in the first six loops the delay between

555
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,080
some requests is 10 seconds while all

556
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,640
other delays are 5 seconds

557
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,360
this way we can find the skipped request

558
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,840
after six attempts to the exp

559
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,000
after six attempts the expected requests

560
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,880
to

561
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,360
the real cnc server appear in the

562
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,158
network traffic

563
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,559
after we published our research on

564
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,880
covering xlr sense infrastructure in

565
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,919
2021 cyber criminals released a new

566
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,440
version of the malware xloader 2.5

567
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,360
the main changes in this version are

568
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,679
intended to make its cnc servers even

569
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,600
more more stealthy

570
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,840
as before xloader chooses 16 random

571
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,400
domains from its configuration

572
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,120
but if we compare exploder 2.5 with the

573
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,440
previous version we see that now they

574
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,000
replace three domains in the list of 16

575
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,080
selected domains instead of two like it

576
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,280
was in the version 2.3

577
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,360
the phone now the list of accessed

578
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,000
domains looks as follows three randomly

579
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,400
chosen domains in the list are replaced

580
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,240
the first one with the

581
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,080
domain from the main url which is a

582
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,520
decoy

583
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,200
the second with another decoy from the

584
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,679
big list of 64 domains

585
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,000
and the third with the real cnc domain

586
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,400
which is also taken from the list of 64

587
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,039
domains from the configuration

588
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,440
this already looks confusing but that's

589
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,360
not all

590
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,240
excluder 2.5 overwrites first eight

591
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,240
domains in the list after each

592
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,880
communication cycle with a new randomly

593
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,400
chosen domains

594
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,240
we also should pay attention to the fact

595
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,720
that the index of the real cnc server is

596
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,520
not saved and if it appears in the first

597
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,360
part of the list

598
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,919
it will be overwritten and won't be

599
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,840
accessed during the next communication

600
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,520
cycle

601
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,919
however there is still a probability

602
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,840
that this domain will appear in the list

603
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,120
again

604
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,280
this is possible because eight domains

605
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,360
that override the first part of the list

606
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,200
are chosen randomly

607
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,440
and the real cnc domain might be one of

608
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,120
them

609
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,440
in this case the probability that a real

610
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,559
cnc server will be accessed in the next

611
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,200
cycle is approximately from 10 to 12

612
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,120
percent depending on the position of the

613
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,200
second fake cnc domain

614
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,280
at first glance we again could think

615
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,600
that this behavior reduces the

616
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,400
reliability of the botnet however

617
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,039
let's look at the next table

618
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,520
assuming the time between communication

619
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,679
cycles is approximately

620
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,440
90 seconds

621
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,679
we counted the probabilities of real

622
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,080
synthesis server being not accessed

623
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,360
again with a given time frame it appears

624
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,720
that

625
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,880
the real cnc domain will be accessed

626
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,200
once in approximately 14 minutes and

627
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
in the worst case it will be accessed

628
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,240
once in two hours with with almost 100

629
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,360
percent probability

630
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,919
the root page of the census servers is

631
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,400
now disguised as a parking domain page

632
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,919
of one of well-known service providers

633
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,360
however

634
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,840
there are some features that still allow

635
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,919
us to easily distinguish a fake page

636
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,679
displayed by the cnc server from the

637
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,880
page generated by the service provider

638
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,080
you can see them on the screenshot

639
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,279
let's sum up

640
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,240
we managed to find approximately 120

641
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,960
real cnc servers and actually this is a

642
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
needle in a haystack in comparison to

643
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,320
the number of legitimate servers

644
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,080
there is no difference in the network

645
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,000
communication with legitimate and

646
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,880
malicious servers and the malware poses

647
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,960
legitimate servers in the configuration

648
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,600
as malicious that's why real malicious

649
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,240
hosts remain undetected for a very long

650
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,919
time while security vendors may

651
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,679
mistakenly block legitimate servers

652
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,039
and now about exploder for macos

653
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,320
in 2021 xloder expanded its activities

654
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,679
to macos

655
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,559
and as we told you before it was first

656
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,440
advertised on high forms in 2020. the

657
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,080
macos version of exploder is sold

658
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,279
cheaper than the windows version however

659
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,440
it probably wasn't such popular

660
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,919
we were unable to find the macos sample

661
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,320
in the wild for a long time also it was

662
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,799
difficult to invent how to search macro

663
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,440
samples if we didn't know what they

664
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,360
looked like and how they behaved

665
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,679
it was a good idea to use the collected

666
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,000
list of cnc domains for exploder for

667
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,760
windows in the virustotal query

668
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,240
and we were lucky to cache the first xlr

669
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,559
sample for mac os in the end of the of

670
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,840
june 2021 expectedly it had zero

671
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,600
detection rate

672
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,840
the macos and windows variants of

673
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,400
exploder are really similar this is good

674
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,679
for us

675
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,919
because this allows us to use similar

676
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,320
rules to hunt malicious samples and use

677
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
slightly changed script to extract

678
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,799
malware configuration however extraorder

679
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,880
for macros have some features for

680
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,559
example

681
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,320
it uses different decryption flow for

682
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,799
the strings and configuration data

683
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,840
and it looks even more tricky than the

684
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,320
version for windows because the buffers

685
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,480
are encrypted in three layers in

686
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,640
comparison to the windows version where

687
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,679
they are encrypted in two layers

688
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,840
the communication protocol of the macros

689
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,320
variant and its list of supported

690
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,200
commands is compatible with exploder for

691
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,159
windows

692
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,960
also both macos and windows variants of

693
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,120
the malware share the same command and

694
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,960
control infrastructure

695
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,279
this allows malware operators to use a

696
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,760
single panel to manage macos and windows

697
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,440
boats

698
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,400
and now to the conclusion rahman

699
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,799
thank you alexey

700
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,400
let's recall the key facts we have

701
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,320
spoken about

702
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
we researched very prevalent malware

703
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,200
with no skills required to use

704
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,520
more than 100 000 legitimate servers

705
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,600
were abused during the course of malware

706
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,440
operations

707
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,520
such legitimate sites may be mistakenly

708
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,279
blocked by security vendors who may

709
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,440
treat them as malicious

710
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,520
the malware is now targeting macos as

711
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,520
opposed to the early versions which we

712
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,200
are targeting only windows

713
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,120
if you are interested in getting more

714
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,880
details on this research

715
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,559
you you're welcome to check our research

716
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,399
page where we have three articles

717
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,640
present on this topic

718
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,240
you're also welcome to visit our

719
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,159
evasions encyclopedia where real

720
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,240
anti-analysis techniques are grouped by

721
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,080
different categories along with the

722
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,919
usage samples and serve descriptions

723
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,919
this concludes our presentation and

724
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,910
thank you so much for your attention

725
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:04,080
[Applause]

726
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,760
okay now the tricky part

727
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,000
okay you're still there

728
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,159
good

729
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,679
so can you try your microphone alexa

730
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,799
hello

731
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,559
oh great yeah hello

732
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,720
oh cool

733
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,080
so

734
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,159
now for questions in the room

735
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,720
yes sir

736
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,840
so introduce yourselves because yeah

737
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,960
um vitale coming from kaspersky i'm

738
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,480
curious about

739
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,919
can you hear me one two three

740
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,240
guys can you hear the question

741
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,760
uh yeah

742
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,960
not not that thoroughly but we can we

743
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,600
can try to answer okay um question is

744
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,200
about the mac os

745
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,520
version of xloader

746
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,039
can you tell if it also has persistence

747
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,720
mechanism and what does it use with mac

748
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,440
os for persistence

749
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,480
uh yes it it has persistence uh

750
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,840
mechanism

751
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,640
um actually it's usual for

752
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,480
any makers malware

753
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,520
um

754
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,120
probably i can't

755
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,840
i can definitely say what it is now

756
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,919
actually it's it's

757
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,279
the same for all micro smaller

758
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,919
okay so it's it's typical typical

759
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,200
persistence

760
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,279
yes mechanism okay

761
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,520
thank you

762
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,320
introduce yourself tom

763
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,880
yes this is tom from swiss post thanks

764
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,240
for the excellent presentation video

765
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,880
um did i understand this correctly that

766
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,960
in the form book

767
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,720
configuration

768
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,960
the

769
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,760
the real c2 domain is is

770
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,640
distinguished or you can distinct

771
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,799
from from the decoys

772
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,520
and in x loader they

773
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,039
they mixed it up in the decoy list so is

774
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,399
it easier to find the real c2

775
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,559
domain in in the

776
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,279
form book configuration

777
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,520
or is that a

778
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,360
misunderstanding

779
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,880
uh in form book of old versions uh the

780
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,880
real cnc server uh is stored separately

781
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,120
in the configuration you can easily find

782
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,320
it

783
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,960
it's stored in the separate buffer

784
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,919
in the

785
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,880
like main url

786
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,000
in the latest version of form book

787
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,399
they moved to the

788
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,559
scheme that was also used in the first

789
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,320
version of exlauder

790
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,480
uh but later

791
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,240
as we told the

792
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,720
exploder was upgraded

793
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,960
heavily and

794
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,399
now actually

795
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,279
it's very difficult to find real senses

796
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,320
servers for forex loader but if you know

797
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,840
how the configuration

798
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,600
looks like

799
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,559
when you

800
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,320
know what to search

801
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,159
in the malware you you can find the real

802
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,559
cnc server very easily

803
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,080
even with the automatic scripts

804
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,840
okay thank you

805
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,799
so you need to decrypt a few buffers

806
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,559
uh you need to decrypt

807
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,039
a part of the code which is executed in

808
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,559
in the system process in explorer

809
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,240
and you can extract the index of the

810
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,919
real cnc domain

811
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:56,720
and

812
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,120
this this index actually points to the

813
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,840
cnc domain

814
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,960
it was a tricky question

815
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,760
another question

816
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,799
come on guys

817
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,559
they understood everything

818
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,120
tom has another question one more

819
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,240
question yeah

820
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,559
um so are there available config

821
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,720
extractors that work on both

822
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,480
form book and

823
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,000
the

824
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,760
x

825
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,440
x loader

826
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,240
or

827
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,919
do you have to write totally different

828
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,960
config extractors for each

829
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,919
uh we have one configuration extractor

830
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,799
for both uh formbook and exploder

831
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,760
and but

832
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,559
[Music]

833
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,200
there are two different flows uh in the

834
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,200
extractor

835
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,480
because

836
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,080
um

837
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,200
as far as i remember exploder has

838
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,880
um

839
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,679
more

840
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,080
buffers containing the decryption keys

841
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,879
and um

842
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,720
the

843
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,279
the encryption flow is

844
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,919
a bit different

845
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,200
okay thanks but it's it's very similar

846
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,320
so uh we can reuse uh part of the code

847
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,159
uh which were using for form book

848
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,240
yeah while there are some differences

849
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,279
are present

850
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,559
there is no necessity to create

851
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,440
separated structures and just slight

852
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,480
tweaks

853
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,399
to what already existed could be made

854
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,279
and

855
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,399
it allowed us to make one universal

856
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,799
structure

857
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,760
okay

858
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,799
any other question

859
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,279
one two three that he has another

860
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,840
question

861
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,279
question machine

862
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,919
sir i just thought about um

863
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,000
given given that x loader

864
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,519
switched to this

865
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,039
model where they don't offer

866
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,079
the buyers of the kid to have own panel

867
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,320
so that they kind of can aggregate all

868
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,960
the data of all their clients using

869
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,800
their own server

870
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,159
if i understood correctly that means the

871
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,159
the owners of the axe loader have access

872
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,320
to all the credentials that are stolen

873
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,119
right

874
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,040
um is there any mechanism in the malware

875
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,520
to prevent this from being stolen on the

876
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,119
server side is there any kind of you

877
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,239
know key

878
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,719
that the client can include to protect

879
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,440
this data or maybe you have seen that

880
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,040
these credentials are actually being

881
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,199
stolen and traded and pop up anywhere

882
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,960
else on the marketplaces perhaps

883
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,000
actually

884
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,239
from what we saw in the dark net the

885
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,520
community

886
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,599
is pretty reliable if we can use this

887
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,760
word for dark net community

888
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,639
and uh there were the exact uh same

889
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,760
questions uh asked to exodus

890
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,920
what about the credentials can we trust

891
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,839
you because the subscription is time

892
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,839
limited and what will be without botnets

893
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,400
after this time expires

894
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,119
uh but there were no cases of uh dumped

895
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,760
credentials of something uh stolen and

896
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,880
abused

897
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,480
we have no

898
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,880
observed any any this cases and from

899
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,920
what we

900
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
uh see recently the community is

901
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,800
predictive the sales are continuing and

902
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,040
the campaigns

903
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,640
appear the new campaigns appear so

904
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,160
this uh whole system is working and uh

905
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,960
uh

906
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,520
what we think is that uh exodus sellers

907
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,599
are pretty um

908
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,079
clear in the intentions they sell their

909
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,760
services and there is no need for them

910
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,400
to

911
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,599
do

912
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,960
anything

913
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,640
to the credentials something like this

914
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,320
so

915
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,960
it's it's a trustful server if we can

916
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
use this word again for the darknet

917
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,599
community thanks that makes it clear and

918
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,200
is there any assessment of how big is

919
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,880
the community are we talking

920
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,520
about hundreds or thousands of potential

921
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,400
clients of this

922
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,359
uh we can church about the clients by

923
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,760
the number of campaigns and what we saw

924
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,560
forex loader it's about two it's more

925
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,320
than two and a half

926
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,119
thousand campaigns and uh some customers

927
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,960
are recurring so they

928
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,760
buy subscriptions uh once again and some

929
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,720
customers are new so um

930
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,320
we can't really

931
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,200
say

932
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,680
uh who are new uh and who are returning

933
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,040
customers but

934
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,200
uh we see that the activity is pretty

935
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,960
persistent and the campaigns are

936
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,040
appearing steadily across the month for

937
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,760
example if we take the last year we see

938
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,800
a steady appearance of new campaigns so

939
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,839
there is no drop there is no rise

940
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:48,800
just

941
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,320
the whole steady scheme is operating

942
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,920
okay

943
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,640
any other question

944
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,800
yes in the front

945
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,200
okay this this will be the last question

946
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,280
don't forget to introduce yourself they

947
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,839
don't see

948
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:10,000
you uh chris wakeling for proof point um

949
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,720
so if you use a form book config

950
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,280
extractor and get this unique url the

951
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,520
one that was put into form book and do

952
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,119
that on x loader

953
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,040
is that going to be that will be a decoy

954
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,480
domain but would it be a legitimate

955
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,880
domain

956
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,160
sorry we didn't hear you

957
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,760
so yeah could you please repeat because

958
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,960
it was not quite clear so if you

959
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,640
use the same technique for extracting

960
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,480
the original

961
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,359
um the actual unique url as opposed to

962
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,280
the decoy ones that gets put into form

963
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,079
book

964
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,480
but you do that on xloader

965
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,359
is that a decoy domain or is that one

966
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,720
that is uh

967
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,839
could it be legitimate

968
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,320
because you say well the decoy domain

969
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,720
support are could be legitimate domains

970
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,720
but you have this unique url those that

971
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,200
gets added to the like it takes one of

972
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,640
them doesn't it and then two from the

973
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,640
decoy domains now

974
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,880
uh do do you mean can we judge

975
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,160
about uh whether the main is the real by

976
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,000
the ap address no

977
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,960
i mean

978
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,880
if you if if you

979
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,200
extract the original

980
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,520
domain you know the unique domain that

981
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,200
uh um that would have worked for phone

982
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,720
book it would have been the real c2 for

983
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,760
phone book

984
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,200
but you do that for x loader

985
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,359
then is that domain going to be a decoy

986
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,560
domain and possibly legitimate or is it

987
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,680
going to be

988
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,760
uh um just another

989
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,040
you know going to go nowhere

990
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,079
i don't think i managed to explain that

991
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,599
so

992
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,119
the question is

993
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,760
is the the technique used for

994
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,599
the first one

995
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,760
uh extracting a domain that would be

996
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,040
legitimate for the other or not

997
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,200
to simplify

998
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,640
could you please uh maybe repeat the

999
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,480
rephrase

1000
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,560
max says it will be a decoy domain so

1001
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,800
he's answered my question

1002
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,040
so mac in the in the room answered it

1003
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,079
will be a decoy domain

1004
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,240
we just didn't uh hear the question

1005
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,640
really and it was difficult yeah it was

1006
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,480
a tricky question going in different

1007
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,680
directions

1008
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,200
um okay guys um would you like i'll i'll

1009
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,240
put my video on so maybe you can see me

1010
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,359
um

1011
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:42,320
do you have a last word for the audience

1012
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,119
now well it's a pity we couldn't be

1013
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,240
present at the event uh i was attending

1014
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,560
the conference four years ago and it was

1015
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,320
a great experience and unfortunately

1016
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,000
uh the events in our country turn out

1017
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,760
that way that we couldn't get the visa

1018
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,440
and so

1019
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,400
we were forced to stay here and

1020
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
we would like to thank you for giving us

1021
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
a chance to make our own presentation

1022
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,760
and to be a part of this great event and

1023
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,880
