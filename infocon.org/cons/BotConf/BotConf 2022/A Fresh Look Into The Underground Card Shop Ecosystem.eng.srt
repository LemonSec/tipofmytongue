1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,839
okay um

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,679
so um in our series this year uh about

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,040
um

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,280
ecosystems and uh

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,960
people around uh malware beatrice and

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,119
lydia are going to

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,600
to share some some thoughts on the

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,400
the card shop ecosystem

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,119
and you have the floor thank you

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,880
hello everyone

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,960
i am lydia lopez and i am here today

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
with beatrice pimenta we both work as

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,399
threat intelligence analyst at blue leaf

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,879
at the thread actor research team

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,040
blue leaf is a spanish based threat

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,520
intelligence company part of the outpost

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,200
24 group

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,760
and today we will be speaking about the

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,120
underground car shop ecosystem

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,680
first of all we are going to speak about

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,520
the different underground car business

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,480
models

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,480
explaining which types of products are

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,520
offered how the cyber criminals can cash

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,199
out to make money

26
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,840
and overall how these markets work

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,560
then we will have a look at some of the

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,280
most relevant car shops right now

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,439
explaining also the methodology we have

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,280
followed to select them

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,759
and also review some car shops that are

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,320
currently offline but used to be very

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,600
important

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,799
and lastly we will share some advice

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,439
and our conclusions

36
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,360
so regarding the advice it will be on

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,840
how to fight credit card credit card

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,159
fraud

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,680
our research interest arose when jokers

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,159
stash one of the major garden shops

41
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,000
until the last year

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
announced its closure

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,880
so

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,759
we were left wondering how such an event

45
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,360
could impact this

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,640
discarding ecosystem and also which

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,320
other other other major shops would

48
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,439
replace joker's stash

49
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,840
so for that we decided to investigate

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,799
this ecosystem from the very beginning

51
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,799
investigating which different types of

52
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,560
markets are out there

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,598
also

54
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,920
checking in some underground specialized

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,959
forums for the feedback from from buyers

56
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,400
of these shops

57
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,440
in order to see which other shops were

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,560
rising

59
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,440
and

60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,959
and we're going to

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,200
to fill the void left by choker's stash

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,560
so there are different venues in which

63
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,920
one can find available cars to buy

64
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,239
and depending on the option that you

65
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,120
choose

66
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,800
there will be different levels of

67
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,040
interaction between the buyer and and

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,480
the seller

69
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:42,790
and

70
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,239
[Music]

71
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,200
so

72
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,440
let's see which different venues

73
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,080
they are available first the automated

74
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,239
bending cards which will be our main

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,440
focus during this presentation

76
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,920
and as the name suggests it's completely

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,000
automated there's no need for

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,599
interaction with

79
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,360
with the seller

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,840
and

81
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,239
basically it's that

82
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,280
it's a simple choose and buy

83
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,159
the second venue are the marketplaces

84
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,720
here different vendors will offer their

85
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,959
products and the buyer can choose from

86
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,280
which to buy from in this case the

87
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,680
reviews are very important

88
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,280
to to see if the vendor is is trusted or

89
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,120
not by the buyers

90
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,760
and lastly there are specialized

91
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,920
cardinal forums and also chatting

92
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,239
platforms such as telegram

93
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,799
that where the transaction is basically

94
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:39,920
manual

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,040
in the case of forums often these have a

96
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,440
marketplace section but that's not

97
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,840
mandatory

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,200
so

99
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,319
um

100
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,599
how a stolen car ended in an automated

101
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,560
bending card or or a marketplace

102
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,360
there are two main selling sections in

103
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,480
car shops

104
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,439
one for buying dams and another one for

105
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,519
buying cvs

106
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,080
so first i'm going to focus on on the

107
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,519
dumps

108
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,480
these are used to conduct a card present

109
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,080
fraud

110
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,199
and the dams are basically payment card

111
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,720
information

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,040
that can be used to create a counterfeit

113
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,320
card

114
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,600
and

115
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,800
the the

116
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,479
when we are speaking about dams we are

117
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,800
referring to the back of the card the

118
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,120
magnetic stripe

119
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,560
and it's called track data so track data

120
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,880
contains sensitive information

121
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,600
such as the card number the expiration

122
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,320
date tcp and the cardholder name

123
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,639
there are two main ways

124
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,240
that threat actors use to get the dumps

125
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,919
first there is the point of sales

126
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,160
malware which basically

127
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,880
infects a point of sales machine times

128
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,560
the process memory

129
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,120
extracts the track data and exfiltrates

130
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
it

131
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,080
and secondly we have the skimmers which

132
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,960
are physical devices that are laid over

133
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,759
at atms gas pumps and other physical

134
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,639
payment terminals also to extract the

135
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,360
track data

136
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,560
and

137
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,720
the second section

138
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,759
that is often encountered in

139
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,160
in the car shops it's the cbb's

140
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,360
that are also sometimes known as cards

141
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,639
and in this case the the cvvs are used

142
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,440
to conduct car not present fraud so

143
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,680
mainly online illegitimate transactions

144
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,440
there are multiple ways

145
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,600
how threat actors can obtain these cbbs

146
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,000
it can be through the creation of

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,840
phishing websites that mimic

148
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,199
the the image of a legitimate

149
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,600
e-commerce e-commerce site

150
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,199
to in order to steal the card

151
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,280
information

152
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,400
also there are the the so-called mage

153
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,000
card reactors that compromise

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,479
e-commerce commerce websites created

155
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,400
with e-commerce platforms such as

156
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,319
magento or shopify with javascript-based

157
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,759
digital schemers apart from that

158
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,560
the cbbs can also be obtained

159
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,039
from leak databases or information still

160
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,639
in malware

161
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,880
in the case of information still in

162
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,600
malware it can be purchased in the cyber

163
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,919
criminal underground for as little as 10

164
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,479
dollars per month as in the case of

165
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,440
bloody stealer

166
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,639
so once the threat actor buys

167
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,759
a card

168
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,520
a cbb or dumb

169
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,120
how they can

170
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,360
make profit from it

171
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,240
there are two main types of illegitimate

172
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,800
transactions there is the card present

173
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,440
fraud and the card not present fraud in

174
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,000
the case of carbon present throughout

175
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,039
present present fraud the threat actor

176
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,759
is going to use

177
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,479
a counterfeit card

178
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,160
created

179
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,319
just going to a store and and pay with

180
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,639
it with information that has been

181
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,199
purchased on the store from dams

182
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,960
and in the case of

183
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
cardinal person flood we are referring

184
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,919
to

185
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,560
online illegitimate transactions but it

186
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,199
can also happen through mail order or

187
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,440
phone

188
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,360
so now that we have established the

189
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,680
functioning logic behind the card shops

190
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,280
we are going to

191
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,000
dive into some major shops that are

192
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,720
currently online or offline but each one

193
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,560
of them provides us with an interesting

194
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,599
angle

195
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,520
that compose a bigger picture of the

196
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,039
current status of the card shop

197
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,160
ecosystem

198
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,400
and the shops we are presenting today

199
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,280
are brian's club ferrum uh all world

200
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,119
cards and also riskater

201
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,360
to guide our research we have

202
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,240
established some criteria so it allows

203
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,319
us to compare the shops so the first

204
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,639
aspect that we highlight is the presence

205
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,960
of the card shop in forums so if the

206
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,360
card is being advertised in forums

207
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,440
which are these specialized forums if

208
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,280
the threat actor behind the

209
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,160
advertisement is has a good reputation

210
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,000
if they are involved in arbitration

211
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,520
arbitration issues if they um constantly

212
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,958
engage in conversations with other

213
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,519
thread actors and finally also if the

214
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,760
card shop is a sponsor a forum sponsor

215
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,240
the second aspect that we highlight is

216
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,959
about communication methods most with a

217
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,680
high focus on telegram channels so if a

218
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,680
card shop has a telegram channel to

219
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,120
increase

220
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,800
the capabilities related to

221
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,480
advertisement and communication with

222
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,640
clients that's a good sign

223
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,279
and as a plus the number of subscribers

224
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,800
to a channel can also be a good

225
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,120
indicative of how popular a shop is

226
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,200
the third aspect that we highlight

227
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,519
is marketing actions because they allow

228
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,640
us to evaluate the assets a shop has and

229
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,760
also the exclusive features the shop has

230
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,920
and finally and most importantly we have

231
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,959
the shop structure per se so at the

232
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,120
layout of the shop how the products are

233
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,200
organized if the shop is automated or

234
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,000
not

235
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,399
the communication methods available

236
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,800
and if also they have other interesting

237
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,399
features available for the customer's

238
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,560
convenience

239
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,399
but before we dive into our analysis

240
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,000
today i wanted to present you with a

241
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,320
brief timeline of events that happened

242
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,600
uh ever since joker stash closed

243
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,399
so

244
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,480
uh joker stash announced their closure

245
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,360
in january 2021 but they just closed a

246
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,760
month later in february 2021.

247
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,360
after three months after that

248
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,120
all world cards came into play with a

249
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,800
huge marketing action around it to

250
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,640
promote the shop

251
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,760
in august 2021 risk skater was back

252
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,399
after a year and a half of inactivity

253
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,240
most probably trying to take back their

254
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
place amongst the most prominent card

255
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,079
shops in the scene

256
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,480
finally and most recently in february

257
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,279
this year 2022

258
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,399
a major

259
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,160
law enforcement operation from russian

260
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,959
authorities took down four four major

261
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,440
shops including ferrum and trump stumps

262
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,279
and amidst this context of law

263
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,839
enforcement operation some other card

264
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,760
shops they try to keep a low profile not

265
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,240
to be seen as the next one in line to be

266
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
seized and that was the case of all

267
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,920
world cards they announced that they

268
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,160
were taking some holidays

269
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,120
um

270
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,519
just to let things go down

271
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,600
but in the end did they never return so

272
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,200
probably

273
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
they actually did an exit scam and just

274
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,680
used the context

275
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,160
as an excuse

276
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,320
okay so our first analyze shop of the

277
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,560
day is brian's club bran's club is

278
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,640
currently active and it is one of the

279
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,800
most prominent and long living shops in

280
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,320
the card scene

281
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,920
nowadays

282
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,839
the registration in the card shop is

283
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,120
free but

284
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,839
users might as much add balance to

285
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,600
within five days otherwise the account

286
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,120
gets banned

287
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,079
and payment can be done in different

288
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,680
types of cryptocurrencies such as

289
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,760
bitcoin litcoin for the customer's

290
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,120
convenience

291
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,200
they also have some interesting features

292
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,600
so paid tools and some free tools so as

293
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,000
an example of a paid tool they offer

294
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,079
checkers which are used to check the

295
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,720
quality of dumps before purchasing them

296
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,399
and for free tools they offer

297
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,160
i'm sorry i forgot the name

298
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,839
they offer yeah bank didn't

299
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,000
identification number lookup

300
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,680
which is used to validate cards before

301
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,839
purchasing them and additionally they

302
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,600
also have a whole section about

303
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,760
education and tutorials about card in

304
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,680
world to their clients so they're very

305
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,880
nice

306
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,680
and all these all these elements they

307
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,839
make the shop look more robust and they

308
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,160
create a sense of credibility and they

309
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,839
make their clients more safe about their

310
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,040
purchases

311
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,880
but in terms of products which is the

312
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,959
most important thing

313
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,040
dumps can be purchased in brian's club

314
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,480
for prices that range between 3 and 269

315
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,200
us dollars while cvvs can be purchased

316
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,760
for prices that range between 8 and 84

317
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,399
us dollars differences in price

318
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,360
comes due to different reasons but i if

319
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,680
i can say so most of them are quite uh

320
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,240
intuitive so for example if a product

321
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,639
has more personal information from the

322
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,279
affected customer it is more expensive

323
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,760
if it is a platinum card over a gold car

324
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,839
it is more expensive if it's a credit

325
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,120
card over a

326
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,360
debit card it is more expensive and the

327
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,600
list goes on but so as a concrete

328
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,880
example this one that costs 269 us

329
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,480
dollars it was issued by unknown bank in

330
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,600
the uk

331
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,680
uh it is okay for international use it

332
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,600
is a platinum card a credit card the

333
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,279
expiration date is far away from the

334
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,760
current date so it is highly valuable

335
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,160
while in contracts contrast the one that

336
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,360
costs three dollars uh is a debit card

337
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,839
with a close expiration date it is

338
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,040
issued by an unknown bank so it's not

339
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,079
really

340
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,079
desired

341
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,399
and here we have an example of the dump

342
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,920
section of

343
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,079
brian's club and as you can see bran's

344
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,160
club is a great example of an automated

345
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,480
vending card because you can simply use

346
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,200
the filters to sort out preferences you

347
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,519
select the desired product you add it to

348
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,200
the cart and then complete the purchase

349
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,040
there's no need to to interact with

350
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,160
anyone

351
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,639
and as you can see per the screenshot

352
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,560
there are different

353
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,560
filter categories such as bank

354
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,880
address price

355
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,279
and so on so on

356
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,040
brian's club is managed by a threat

357
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,440
actor named brian krebs which is not the

358
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,120
journalist of course

359
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,920
um but and they are active in different

360
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,720
specialized forms since at least 2015 so

361
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,440
forms such as club 2 card and card villa

362
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,079
and they're active in these shops to

363
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,079
interact with customers promote the shop

364
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,560
and so on and this is one of the two

365
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,639
possibility of communication methods

366
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,880
with with them and the other one being

367
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,720
shop tickets

368
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,800
here we have an example of a thread

369
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,880
initiated by brian krebs in a forum

370
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,600
advertising brand club brian's club and

371
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,199
also highlighted highlighting the

372
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,079
strongest features of the shop and most

373
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,480
importantly also providing a list of

374
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,880
available domains available in trustable

375
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,560
domains because there are many scammers

376
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,800
out there so this is really important

377
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,959
and threads like this can be found in

378
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,279
multiple other forums

379
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,399
here we have

380
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,000
an interesting finding more of a fun

381
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,560
fact but while i was doing the research

382
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,360
for this presentation i saw that the

383
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,680
thread actor behind riskater which is a

384
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,839
competitor has been checking brian

385
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,959
krabb's profile on on the bbc forum

386
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,360
which means that that as in any other

387
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,279
more conventional market

388
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,199
competitors are keeping an eye on their

389
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,839
peers to keep their shop their prices

390
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,880
their products up to date

391
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,320
now i'm going to speak about the

392
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,880
skater car shop that it's accompanied a

393
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,440
competitor of brian dams

394
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,920
and it's also an automated car vending

395
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,800
shop

396
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,000
this shop was created around 200 2013.

397
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,759
it it has been very popular until 2000

398
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,720
mid 2019 then it went offline for a

399
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,839
while but it came back strong in mid

400
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,560
2021 as we can see

401
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,040
in in the top of the

402
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,560
of this light

403
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,279
legendary skater is back this is the

404
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,600
banner that we have seen

405
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,440
in the advertisement in some forums

406
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,600
so differently from

407
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,360
from brian dams

408
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
in this case it's only possible to pay

409
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,759
with bit with bitcoin but the

410
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,000
registration is also free

411
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,720
they also offered some paid tools

412
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,959
but

413
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,720
not as not as many as brian dams

414
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,920
and the vip customers can see updates

415
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,839
one hour earlier than the rest of the

416
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,320
customers

417
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,639
here we can see a screenshot of the of

418
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,079
the skater

419
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,399
in this case we can see that they also

420
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,360
offer many many filters

421
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,000
interestingly it's possible to to filter

422
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,800
by a specific birthday or a specific

423
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,480
phone number

424
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,720
and as bia mentioned the price will

425
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,839
depend on multiple factors so

426
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,440
if the

427
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,839
if the information is more detailed they

428
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,240
they offer more information it's going

429
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,959
to be a higher price also if the card is

430
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,480
a platinum car

431
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,279
or

432
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,759
a gold card a classic card it will

433
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,320
depend on that and when is the

434
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
expiration date also will affect the

435
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,199
price

436
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,160
so who is advertising this

437
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,520
this car shop

438
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,480
currently this shop is advertised by the

439
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,439
legendary skater moniker

440
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,160
mostly this this moniker has registered

441
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,919
in multiple forums

442
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,240
uh in in august 2021 but we also found

443
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,000
the first registration in 2014

444
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,640
and if we go back to the early days of

445
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,360
the shop it used to be advertised by

446
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,760
riskater and at a lesser extent helkern

447
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,400
so at that time it was advertised in

448
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,679
forums such as lampedusa and other

449
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,640
forums that are less popular or inactive

450
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,600
and

451
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,840
they had they were managing four

452
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,080
different shop brands that eventually

453
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,720
all merge into riskater

454
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,120
so for the communication methods

455
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,480
they they open different threads in in

456
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,799
specialized carding forums

457
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,320
and

458
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,960
anyone can can ask questions and provide

459
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,200
their feedback there but apart from that

460
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,840
it's also possible to open a shop ticket

461
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,200
so regarding the inactive car shops

462
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,440
there are three three reasons that

463
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,919
explain why car shops

464
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,679
are closed or are inactive

465
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,320
so the first case is exemplified by

466
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,360
joker's stash an organized closure

467
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,000
in this case the operators of the shop

468
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,039
will give

469
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,520
some early warnings and even sometimes

470
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,080
explain why they have decided to close

471
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,120
the shop giving sometimes some time for

472
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,520
the buyers to do their last purchase

473
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,799
purchases

474
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,240
or to retire their funds from the shop

475
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,200
the second the second reason why a shop

476
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,600
might be inactive is because of a

477
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,760
seizure by law enforcement

478
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,360
we have seen this

479
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,760
recently because in last february the

480
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
russian authorities took down four

481
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,919
different car shops

482
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,039
and the third reason is the most common

483
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,400
one the exit scam

484
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,799
this is the the first explanation that

485
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,559
comes to mind

486
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,120
to mind when when a car shop is inactive

487
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,360
or or offline

488
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,480
and we often encounter a lot of posts

489
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,280
from

490
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,760
from buyers complaining in forums

491
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,360
worried about their lost fans

492
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,840
so the first inactive car shop that we

493
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,280
want to

494
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,919
comment comment today is fair room

495
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,480
feron was a very important car shop

496
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,559
since 2013

497
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,080
so one of the oldest car shops

498
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,320
and we wanted to highlight that it used

499
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,120
to include a banner of the competitor

500
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,960
drumstamp which was also consistently

501
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,799
seized in the same law enforcement

502
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,640
operation by the russian authorities

503
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,760
here we can see a screenshot of the cvv

504
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,440
section of ferrum

505
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,000
in this case we see that the design was

506
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,440
not very advanced it didn't have

507
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,679
any of the cool features that we have

508
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,520
seen paid tools

509
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:17,770
and

510
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,360
[Music]

511
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,360
but they offer a high amount of of cbbs

512
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,159
they offer millions of compromised cards

513
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,720
and also they offer them at affordable

514
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,280
prices if we compare them to current

515
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,320
offers of car shops nowadays

516
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,159
and as i mentioned earlier uh currently

517
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,880
all world card is offline

518
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,200
and it has been so since february this

519
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,240
year

520
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,480
and for that and since the rumors

521
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,679
started about the the exit scam uh the

522
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,600
threat actor behind all world cards was

523
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
banned from several forums and they were

524
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,679
labeled as as you can see here as a

525
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,159
ripper and a club to card for them for

526
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,480
instance but before all that happened

527
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,360
all world cards had a great reputation

528
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,600
because they launched a marketing action

529
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,799
a marketing campaign in august 2021 that

530
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,520
consisted in releasing one million free

531
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,280
cards to their clients because again

532
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,720
they're so nice

533
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,240
and

534
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,760
despite the fact that these cards were

535
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,799
compromised between 2018 and 2019 still

536
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,440
in 2021 uh clients were able to find

537
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,640
valid cards amidst this this big list so

538
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,360
this gave a good credibility to the shop

539
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
and at least a good visibility but also

540
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,960
great credibility

541
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,080
um

542
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,919
and we assessed that this one million

543
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,679
cars they were compromised mostly

544
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,400
through car not present fraud so digital

545
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,880
schemers and phishing and other types of

546
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,159
social engineering techniques

547
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,679
okay so while we research card shops we

548
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,080
often find phishing pages from scammers

549
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,400
and recently the bluelive labs team

550
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,960
found a suspicious card shop and we

551
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,280
decided to investigate further and what

552
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,520
we found was hundreds of thousands of

553
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,400
domains that were mimicking major card

554
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,120
shops in in maybe in domain names but

555
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,159
also in layout so major card shops such

556
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,880
as trump's dumps ferrum all world cards

557
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,240
um brian's club they also they all had

558
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,280
this their version their fishing version

559
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,240
and all of these fishing cart shops they

560
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,120
were listing the same number of fake

561
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,480
cards

562
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,559
and when the client clicked on the

563
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,320
receive card section

564
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,640
they would actually be downloading a

565
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,159
clipper malware instead of a free card

566
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,559
and when we analyzed some of the domains

567
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,919
of this campaign

568
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,960
we saw that they were registered between

569
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,440
2015 and 2022 so probably this is one

570
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,320
major operation that is divided into

571
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,559
different campaigns and the

572
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,760
latest one dated from march 2022 they

573
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,440
can be related to the recent

574
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,080
developments in the card shops ecosystem

575
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,640
so the takedowns the exit scams and so

576
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,760
on

577
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,159
so here we have an example of how the

578
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,200
fishing firm shop looked so the domain

579
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,679
name made a reference to forum to ferrum

580
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,120
sorry

581
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,039
but the display it does not look like

582
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,080
the original pharaoh but still

583
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,880
i don't know people might fall for it

584
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,960
and this is the receive card section so

585
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,120
when the client clicks on the receive

586
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,120
card they are redirected to an onion

587
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,799
page to download the file that was

588
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,280
allegedly the free card but instead it

589
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,200
would download the clipper malware and

590
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,679
what does a clipper malware do

591
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,080
they substitute the desired

592
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,279
cryptocurrency wallet address for a

593
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,039
cryptocurrency wallet address controlled

594
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,640
by the threat actor

595
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,919
and this is interesting this whole

596
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,760
campaign is interesting not only due to

597
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,679
the magnitude of the campaign with the

598
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,760
hundreds of thousands of domains but

599
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,679
also because we see that scammers are

600
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,600
also trying to in fact other cyber

601
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,679
criminals so they know their motives

602
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,760
apparently and they they profit from it

603
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,320
scamming other cyber criminals and as

604
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,240
the saying goes apparently it's no crime

605
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,960
to steal from a thief

606
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,559
okay now that we are headed towards the

607
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,159
end of our presentation we wanted to

608
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,080
offer you some brief advice on how to

609
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,880
fight

610
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,120
card fraud some are more general some

611
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,640
are more specific

612
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,559
and the first one is more aimed at

613
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,679
retailing

614
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,919
and it is the incentive to adopt the 3d

615
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,080
secure protocol which was set in place

616
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,320
by card issuers and they had

617
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
an additional security layer to online

618
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,480
transactions so both the shop and the

619
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,720
client are more are more safe in these

620
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,159
online transactions

621
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,320
the second advice is more general and it

622
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,039
is to stay on top of the latest security

623
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,120
standards such as the global data

624
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,520
security regulatory standard

625
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,440
the third advice is also very general

626
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,120
but it is to keep all hardware and

627
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,600
software up to date so we can decrease

628
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,039
the

629
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,799
threat surface and this way we can

630
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,440
quickly patch potential vulnerabilities

631
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,039
and finally also actively scanning

632
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,320
physical equipment to try to to find

633
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,600
skimming devices and so on

634
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,360
the conclusions that we hope it's now

635
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,480
clear for you

636
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,880
is that first the thread the i'm sorry

637
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,440
the card shop ecosystem is highly

638
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,679
fluctuating so there are many factors

639
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,559
that can affect the current status of

640
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,520
the ecosystem such as personal reasons

641
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,400
such as the case with joker stash

642
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,120
law enforcement actions uh political

643
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,039
momentum the adoption of new security

644
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,840
policies the list is vast and this leads

645
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,840
us to our second conclusion which is the

646
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,080
importance of continuously monitoring

647
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,640
sources so not only the shops per se but

648
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,559
also

649
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,440
forums and telegram channels so we as a

650
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,760
security community we can stay on top of

651
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,159
the latest developments and and we can

652
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,320
see potential trends so for instance

653
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,679
future trends is the adoption of cvvs

654
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,279
over dumps

655
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,440
due to the more and more adoption of

656
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,520
countries of security chips instead of

657
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,039
magnetic stripes

658
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,480
and finally it's important to see

659
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,559
scamming as an inheritance part

660
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,039
of the ecosystem because

661
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,360
not only card users are being targeted

662
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,760
by target by carding but also other

663
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,919
cyber criminals so we should

664
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,919
have this take this into consideration

665
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,480
when we are analyzing

666
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,320
we are analyzing this ecosystem

667
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,679
and that's it

668
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,279
that's all for us

669
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,240
if

670
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,000
it doesn't i'm sorry it doesn't appear

671
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,440
to you okay

672
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,600
so but this is all for us if you have

673
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,440
any questions any comments please feel

674
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,240
free to reach out to us later or now

675
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,400
we're very happy to to answer those

676
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,800
questions thank you so much

677
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:49,679
[Applause]

678
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,840
thank you okay any questions yes

679
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,279
hey thank you for the presentation

680
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,600
julian from marabytes um

681
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,640
i had a question about these cards

682
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,440
stolen and sold on these shops do you

683
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,760
know if the cards are sold more than

684
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,200
once

685
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,799
to different

686
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,200
buyers

687
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,039
um there are shops as we mentioned

688
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,159
before like um trump's dumps and um

689
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,000
ferum they they were listing the same

690
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,440
sometimes they were listing the same

691
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,399
cards

692
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,399
uh but and lydia can help me with that

693
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,240
but i don't believe they are

694
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,360
sold more than once okay i believe it's

695
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,960
or at least you cannot cash out more

696
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,399
than once i believe

697
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,880
so the shops don't allow to

698
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,960
sell it more than once after it's sold

699
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,559
it's gone for

700
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,120
other buyers

701
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,840
or you don't know

702
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,039
we haven't specifically investigated

703
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,120
that but i think it's it's interesting

704
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,080
the fact that riskater uh this the same

705
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,760
operators were running four different

706
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,320
shops then and they eventually merge

707
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,760
into one so it that goes to say that

708
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,919
maybe sometimes the same operator can

709
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,880
manage different different car shops

710
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,799
uh but we haven't

711
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,679
we don't we have no evidence to say that

712
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,799
the same card is sell more than once

713
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,440
okay thank you

714
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,240
all right hello uh mail from netcraft

715
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,880
here uh i was wondering so your advice

716
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,360
doesn't include anything about

717
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,919
fighting against online skimmers

718
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,919
and digital resources like this i was

719
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,440
wondering if you

720
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,679
had any insight about the detection and

721
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,640
takedowns of those and maybe like why

722
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,120
why you were not recommending it or if

723
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,080
it's just an oversight or you're not um

724
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,399
thinking about this site uh this sort of

725
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,799
target here

726
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,480
yeah so usually usually the web schemers

727
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,440
are targeting platforms like comic

728
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,039
platforms as magento shopify

729
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,080
so here what would like to say is that

730
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,320
it's important to always

731
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,399
uh keep updated the the different so

732
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,960
if for example you are using magento and

733
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,919
they release a security update that's

734
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,720
probably because there is a flaw and

735
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,799
they have patches so

736
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:26,240
this is a bit of general advice but um

737
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,600
yeah that's

738
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,200
that that's a way how e-commerce's can

739
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,919
can protect their shops and probably

740
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,120
there's

741
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,120
other advice but this is what comes to

742
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,360
mind now

743
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,080
hi

744
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,240
david from proofpoint um i have a

745
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,960
question on the phishing campaign

746
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,000
targeting the scammers basically

747
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,080
do you have any idea on

748
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,000
the size of the customer base for these

749
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,360
shops and because i was wondering

750
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,880
i mean trying to scam these scammers is

751
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,840
uh okay what makes sense of course but

752
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,159
at the same time they're also kind of

753
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,360
usually i mean they're a bit more tech

754
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,760
savvy than the random users they're used

755
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,039
to to run the scams themselves so i i

756
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:15,919
think

757
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,159
it's probably less likely for them to

758
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,159
fall prey of

759
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,960
of a clipping malware and at the same

760
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,960
time if if i wear a scammer i would

761
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,880
rather just try to install a clipping

762
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,039
malware and set up fake domains

763
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,240
targeting

764
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,960
crypto platforms that regular users use

765
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,640
because they should have a bigger

766
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,960
customer base so i'd be just interested

767
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,399
in your thoughts around this

768
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,399
yeah i guess it depends on how

769
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,840
sophisticated is the is the scam so in

770
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,640
this case we have seen an example where

771
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,320
the layout is is different from

772
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,760
from from ferrum or from our cards but

773
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,279
in

774
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,120
but when the when a car shop goes

775
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,399
offline

776
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,279
then if pr if the person didn't know the

777
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,840
layout that it used to have it probably

778
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,679
can fall for it and there are more

779
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,200
sophisticated

780
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,240
scams that probably mimic better the the

781
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,760
layout of of the original car shop so

782
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,600
and also we have seen that a lot of

783
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,559
these domains um are actually indexed by

784
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,880
google so if you don't know the mirror

785
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,559
of the original

786
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,799
car shop it's it's easy to to find um

787
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,679
the wrong domain a phishing domain

788
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,000
but yeah i understand their point of

789
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,120
view that probably they don't fall as a

790
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,080
scam

791
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,240
to scams as often as the general

792
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,240
population

793
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,480
but if i can add something

794
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,240
there is the level of sophistication of

795
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,240
the campaign per se but also the level

796
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,559
of sophistication of the threat actor so

797
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,840
like

798
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,559
minor like criminals maybe they are not

799
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,480
aware of how the

800
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
how the ecosystem works so may they

801
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,640
might fall for it but as as we said we

802
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,120
haven't investigated the in-depth that

803
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,200
but that what comes to mind or in terms

804
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,799
of sophistication of threat actors

805
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,559
involved

806
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,960
okay the last question

807
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,880
great research yeah thank you so i have

808
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,200
a question on the cash out avenues so

809
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,240
for

810
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,840
for counterfeit

811
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,000
cards right they can i assume they

812
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,760
cannot use in the chip enabled

813
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,360
transactions right

814
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,640
and if

815
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,919
yeah this is the

816
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,080
vast majority of the cards are chip

817
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,360
based and all the posts right machines

818
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,480
are only reading chips then they cannot

819
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,600
cash out anymore right

820
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,320
so

821
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,880
the trend that we are seeing now is that

822
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,840
uh there is much more card not present

823
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,600
fraud than card present fraud and the

824
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,559
the reason and that that's basically the

825
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,760
reason because more and more card

826
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,360
card issuers are implementing the emv

827
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,960
the emb chips

828
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,679
but there are still

829
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,640
some some countries and some car

830
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,039
some shops that are still using

831
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,159
the the magnetic stripes so

832
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,880
the reason why chips are much more

833
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,360
difficult to replicate

834
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,159
um to to create a counterfeit card is

835
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,840
that um

836
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,559
every time there's a transaction a new

837
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,919
code is generated and this is not reused

838
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,840
so yeah it's much more difficult to

839
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,039
replicate but we'll see in the future

840
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,519
if threat actors evolve and get more

841
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,159
sophisticated and we see a card

842
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,840
replication for emb chips thank you

843
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,120
thank you thank you very much

844
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:53,399
[Applause]
