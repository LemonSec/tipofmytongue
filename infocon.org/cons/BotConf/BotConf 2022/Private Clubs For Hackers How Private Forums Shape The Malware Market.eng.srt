1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,720
okay um

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,120
so actually earlier today i made a

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,280
mistake in the in the in in my

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,800
introduction speech the the first

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,639
conference was in december 2013

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,960
and uh david was already there

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,320
um and uh so the the this shows the uh

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,400
the confidence of the people who attend

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,680
vodka

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,359
over the years

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,880
and

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,840
uh

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,599
actually he did a presentation on a

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,239
similar topic

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,360
um and um

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,440
this highlights one of the uh

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,440
one of the issues we are trying to

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,480
address with botkov it's a trying to

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,320
look at

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,239
not only botnets but

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,760
all malware ecosystems as a whole

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,480
and not just that

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,559
malware that you analyze and from which

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,719
you get

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,960
technical information but

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,199
also about the people around them the

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,680
way they interact

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,159
you had some some example on the

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,000
presentation before

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,320
relating to specific individuals and so

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,360
on

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,240
um and the the the work david and other

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,479
people have been doing on the

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,880
the ecosystem and the interactions is is

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,280
really important in understanding uh how

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,799
all this works and how we can better

37
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,360
fight against them so uh it's it's

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,720
really nice

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,240
um

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,600
so they're going to talk about a

41
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,920
specific forum uh

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,439
today and um so it's david

43
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,158
de cary echo

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,119
they've been working with other people

45
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,920
they'll tell you about it and you have

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,360
the floor thank you thank you

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,560
okay thank you so much for for having us

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,320
and thank you to the speakers that

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,719
intervened before us for their amazing

50
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,000
presentation

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,799
uh

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,759
so

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,280
i wanted to give you just a little bit

54
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,600
of context uh about this project because

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,360
i think it is important

56
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,119
um this project is a collaboration

57
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,239
between a small institute in switzerland

58
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,120
and

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,599
and a bigger let's say reality in in

60
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,760
canada in in immoral

61
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,120
and

62
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,599
so i represent the swiss part and i have

63
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,760
to admit i am a bit of an outsider here

64
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,120
so i come from a town called new chateau

65
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,120
uh a small town called new chatel in

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,080
which there is an also small institute

67
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,800
uh very busy but small that's called the

68
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,680
uh

69
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,519
institute contact community economics so

70
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,879
the institute of the fight against

71
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,599
economic crime now this institute exists

72
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,599
since the year 2000

73
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,560
and

74
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,640
at the beginning it was more focused on

75
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
the you know the staples of economic

76
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,360
crimes like corruption uh money

77
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,560
laundering

78
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,680
and you know this classic

79
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,840
criminal phenomenons but since i have

80
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,480
started working there in 2014 i have

81
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,640
noticed rapidly that our our projects

82
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,959
were mainly dealing with

83
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,319
crimes that are a digital or computer

84
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,519
element

85
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,440
and that of course

86
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
for someone like me who has a legal

87
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,360
background because my background is that

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,879
it's legal

89
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,959
required uh

90
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,200
maybe trying to understand a bit more

91
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,840
also the technical side of some things

92
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,959
which i have to say uh sadly um there is

93
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,959
a bit of a gap i come from the legal

94
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,280
community and maybe you have noticed the

95
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,680
same in your experience sometimes there

96
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,840
is really a gap between

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,640
what

98
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,200
legal people know like from a technical

99
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,879
point of view and what you know people

100
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,159
that come from a computer science

101
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,760
background know but sometimes these

102
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,000
people have to work together to to make

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,080
thing happens to in order to fight

104
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,040
against economic crime and so this is

105
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
why i'm so excited to be here because

106
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,519
for me it's it's a real opportunity uh

107
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,760
you know to to delve into some some

108
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,840
stuff that for me is more complex and to

109
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,599
and to learn new things so again

110
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,200
this collaboration that we have with

111
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,640
with david and the university of

112
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,480
montreal for us is about bridging the

113
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,560
gap it's about creating projects in

114
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,120
which i can bring my my expertise

115
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,439
but you know i cannot do

116
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,120
anything on my own especially because i

117
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,279
like the technical background and so to

118
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,839
to have the help of people who have

119
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,199
the technical background and i think

120
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,120
those synergies are

121
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,520
very important moving forward so to

122
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,360
introduce the project uh i want to tell

123
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,280
you that our institute has been busy in

124
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
the last years trying to meet the

125
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,560
criminals

126
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,080
in their own playground okay so we

127
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,479
have been trying to observe criminal

128
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,720
behavior as they happen

129
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,800
in real time and one of the biggest

130
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,440
biggest projects that we that we have is

131
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,040
a project on scan scam baiting of uh

132
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,440
fraudsters that perpetrate roman scam

133
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,600
now a roman scam obviously is

134
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,240
the the classic mo is creating a fake

135
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,560
account being present on a platform such

136
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,000
as for example tinder and you know

137
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,400
acting as if the the scammer is falling

138
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,720
in love and then asking for money and so

139
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,280
we have been present on those platform

140
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,280
interacting and observing criminal

141
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,680
behavior collecting data collecting

142
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,720
intel

143
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,120
collecting information such as events in

144
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,880
order to to

145
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,680
uh frustrate also the the criminal

146
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,919
activity and learn more about it now as

147
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,199
you can see this is something that we

148
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,240
can do

149
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,919
with our own

150
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:28,720
uh

151
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,800
background and with our own

152
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,199
skills because it's it's it's still the

153
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,600
the human interaction

154
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,800
and another project that we have that is

155
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,160
the one that we were going to talk about

156
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,360
today

157
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,520
it's also about analyzing criminal

158
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,000
behavior in a certain context and in

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,560
this case it's about analyzing uh the

160
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,360
behavior on on forums on internet forums

161
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,800
in which

162
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,680
hackers and and people that

163
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,600
perpetrate cyber crime interact with

164
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,240
each other and so for this project

165
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,880
we couldn't do it of course on our own

166
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,960
and this is why we established a

167
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,639
connection with the university of

168
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,840
montreal

169
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,440
and david who is here with me today

170
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,520
and we started looking at

171
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,759
at forums now farms of course we know

172
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,680
them also in other fields in economic

173
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,960
crime as platforms of information

174
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,240
sharing so people who are likely minded

175
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,400
criminally minded they meet on those

176
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,280
forums they ask questions they share

177
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,120
tutorials they share

178
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,400
information

179
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,520
and basically they they communicate

180
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,319
now those forums have also another side

181
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,560
as sometimes they function as as a

182
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,960
meeting point that can then lead to

183
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,880
transactions now the transaction

184
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,960
obviously don't happen on the forum

185
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,319
themselves but

186
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,800
uh they are displaced on

187
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,280
communication services such as telegram

188
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,440
for example but

189
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,880
so this double side of of the forums

190
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,800
creates a

191
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,880
a good observation

192
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,039
zone for us because we can monitor we

193
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,440
can see the interactions

194
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,880
there are of course

195
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,960
countless forms

196
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,880
in the criminal underground and also

197
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,120
countless forums where discussions about

198
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,440
malware and also transactions about

199
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,880
malware are

200
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,160
taking place

201
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,720
some of those forums are public which

202
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
means that you know anyone can access

203
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,599
them in some other cases the access is

204
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,240
restricted now that of course can

205
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,680
keep out us you know researchers

206
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,400
also can keep out

207
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
law enforcement authorities or other

208
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,680
authorities

209
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,479
and also can create let's say a more

210
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,240
safe

211
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,400
and professional maybe environment in

212
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,520
which

213
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,199
people who are more

214
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,360
skilled can communicate or they can

215
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,400
communicate in a more secure way or at

216
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,440
least

217
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,759
this is what we

218
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,639
thought

219
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,000
and

220
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,240
so we also wanted to to check if this

221
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,080
like myth of the

222
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,199
elite

223
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,520
private forum was something that

224
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,479
uh

225
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,120
was real if we could by analyzing

226
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,160
private and public form if we could

227
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,800
put our hands on some data that could

228
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,400
prove that this

229
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,160
difference uh

230
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,560
existed and so

231
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,039
to start doing that and i come again to

232
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,039
the importance of working to the getter

233
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,199
and of synergies we couldn't do it on

234
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,360
our own and this is where

235
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,679
david comes into play with his

236
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,399
experience first in helping us gaining

237
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,159
access to those forums and then

238
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,479
gathering the data set that

239
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,040
has allowed us to to obtain the results

240
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,240
that we will present today

241
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,440
yeah so so basically the goal of the

242
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
project was really to understand the

243
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,519
differences between the public forums

244
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,279
which can be easily accessed by anyone

245
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,760
online and the forums which are a bit

246
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,920
more private and more restricted

247
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,480
and there's been very scant research on

248
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,240
these more private forums that has been

249
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,760
published so far

250
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,279
here you have a paper by a colleague of

251
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,680
mine in montreal who did research on

252
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,959
dark code

253
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,880
which was known as one of these forms i

254
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,120
wanted to be a bit more private and what

255
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,880
was really interesting is when he looked

256
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,800
at the data of all the people that

257
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,680
applied actually 95 of the people who

258
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,360
applied to dark code were actually

259
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,720
accepted so i don't know if any of you

260
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
guys try to get in but it was apparently

261
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,959
extremely easy to get into this form

262
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,560
even though they kind of put up this

263
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,399
dialogue in this wall saying you know

264
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,080
you need to be part of the community and

265
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,399
you need to be invited or need to prove

266
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,720
that you belong to this community to go

267
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,320
into this form

268
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,360
and so

269
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,399
um we wanted to look at this topic and

270
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,240
to try and better understand kind of

271
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,360
what are the differences in the

272
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
activities that are advertised on these

273
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,200
markets and

274
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,920
so this is extremely an exploratory

275
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,720
research project so uh and we can't

276
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,880
really generalize to all of the forms of

277
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,959
course what we what we studied in here

278
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,440
but basically we just took two forms one

279
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,560
of them was

280
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,160
on the private side

281
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,600
and it was a bit bigger than the other

282
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,360
one and our goal was to look in these

283
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,839
forms for their marketplace section so

284
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,519
in these marketplace sections you're

285
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,680
going to find all the advertisements for

286
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,240
all these services and hacking

287
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,040
hacking malware and we focus really on

288
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,880
the malware side of things and to look

289
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,959
at what malware was advertised on these

290
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,920
forms

291
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,680
and we look at all the treads that were

292
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,160
started between june 1st 2020 and

293
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,440
february 10 2021 and basically we

294
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,279
selected all the treads where we could

295
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,839
find information about malware and so in

296
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,800
the end we came up with about 86 malware

297
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,440
from the public forum and about 136

298
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,959
malware which came from the private

299
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,360
forum and we got all the information

300
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,440
that we could either from the post in

301
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
those threads or from open source

302
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,040
research on the internet trying to

303
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,800
gather as much information as we could

304
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,600
about these malware and so in these next

305
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,800
slides what i'm going to present is kind

306
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,560
of our analysis of these malware what

307
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,720
was for sale and our goal once again is

308
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,640
really to compare kind of these two

309
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,000
sides

310
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,800
so

311
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,839
um

312
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,160
malware is a very broad and generic term

313
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
so extremely difficult to kind of

314
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,839
summarize everything that's going on

315
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,360
with malware

316
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,200
one thing that we tried to do is to look

317
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
at what was kind of the the point of

318
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,760
this malware so one way to look at it is

319
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,640
to look well is this malware looking to

320
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,959
access or provide access to a machine or

321
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,440
is it main goal is to exfiltrate

322
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,519
information and exfiltrate data from

323
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,480
these from their victims and so in this

324
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,920
case it was really interesting first of

325
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,120
all to see that there's not much

326
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,279
differences between the two of them

327
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,440
so basically it's almost half split

328
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,240
halfway in both cases um in the case of

329
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,680
private forum when we tried to

330
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,200
understand kind of what this malware was

331
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,880
doing it was a bit more difficult

332
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,800
sometimes because we have as much

333
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
information just because maybe the

334
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,440
malware was a bit more private or secret

335
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,120
or there was less research by you guys

336
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,880
that were made on it but basically it

337
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,120
was kind of split kind of you know in

338
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,519
the middle

339
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,440
when we look at the

340
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,360
first class which was kind of providing

341
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,959
access to a machine

342
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,800
we could further divide it into kind of

343
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,519
two very broad categories once again

344
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,959
either the malware that would give you

345
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,560
access to the machine so you could kind

346
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,320
of manually log in

347
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,839
do whatever you wanted with it maybe

348
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,560
pivot to other systems or if it was

349
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,320
mainly targeted at just you know

350
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,079
providing you access with a bot on the

351
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,120
machine

352
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
and here we did see some differences

353
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,440
some larger differences and we saw that

354
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,839
for example when it was more customized

355
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,680
so that you could actually access the

356
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,079
machine log in and control it to pivot

357
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,839
to other machines or do other stuff the

358
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,040
private forum was actually um

359
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,279
offering more options in that case than

360
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,040
the public forum and this isn't

361
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,320
surprising because if you want to be

362
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,160
doing something manual it's probably

363
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,000
going to be more of an elite or

364
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
sophisticated class of actors basically

365
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,959
when we look at the data exfiltration

366
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,480
part of it so this was kind of the

367
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,160
second class of malware

368
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,560
here we decided we tried to once again

369
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,920
kind of cut it up in different

370
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,399
categories um we see that there's a lot

371
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,240
more uh differences here than what we

372
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,360
saw before

373
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,040
one of the big difference here is on the

374
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,200
private forums we saw advertising

375
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,680
sniffer malware so malware that was

376
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,839
looking at analyzing the network data

377
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,360
something that we didn't really see in

378
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,880
the public forum

379
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,279
and also we saw a small share of the

380
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,639
malware that was looking you know at

381
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,560
video recorders so malware that would

382
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
just that was aimed mainly at just

383
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,040
recording you know their targets videos

384
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,279
um and for the rest of it the categories

385
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,199
were quite similar basically in terms of

386
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,000
the

387
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,720
data exfiltration

388
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,839
when we look at the target

389
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,279
infrastructure we were actually

390
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,120
expecting to see more and more malware

391
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,440
that was targeting mobile phones that's

392
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,279
not something that we saw that wasn't

393
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,519
all too common uh we did see that it was

394
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,680
twice as more common on the private than

395
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,399
on planet forum and so once again um

396
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,000
this is maybe something that's newer

397
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,680
something that's maybe a bit more

398
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,760
sophisticated and so once again it was

399
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,600
kind of in line with our research and

400
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,639
looking at the private forums

401
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,639
now the next two slides to me are the

402
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,440
most too interesting um so the first

403
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,360
thing that we wanted to like it was well

404
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,120
when was this malware published that was

405
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,079
being sold on these forms and what we

406
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,760
figured out what we thought initially

407
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,000
was that we would have maybe this

408
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,760
malware that would be sold first of all

409
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,160
in these private forms and then after a

410
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,839
while it would kind of dribble down to

411
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,920
these public forums and so we were

412
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,399
expecting to see a lot of new malware on

413
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,639
these private forums and see older

414
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,480
malware on the public ones

415
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,720
and this is this was kind of surprising

416
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,560
to see that actually was a lot of new

417
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,639
malware that was just popping up on this

418
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,720
public forum compared to the private

419
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,920
ones and of course we didn't really find

420
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,600
very old malware for sale on these

421
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,320
private forums but we did see a mix of

422
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
uh of these

423
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,040
new malware on the public and the

424
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,199
private forums

425
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,320
the other thing that was really

426
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,000
interesting was looking at the price

427
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,079
comparison so one of the big question

428
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,959
that we had was how do you quantify the

429
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,959
quality of the malware that is being

430
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,399
offered for sale

431
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,199
and

432
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,399
there's a million different ways that

433
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,519
you can go about it and it would be

434
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,120
really interested if you have another

435
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,760
way of kind of quantifying uh how

436
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,320
efficient or how good a malware can be

437
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,639
one way of doing it is looking at the

438
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,040
price basically so we all know like

439
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,560
there's this famous paper that sells

440
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,480
nobody sells gold for the price of

441
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,440
silver

442
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,360
well we would expect that more

443
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,519
sophisticated malware would actually be

444
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,279
sold for a higher price

445
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,800
and so we looked at all the prices that

446
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,399
we could find for these malwares on the

447
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,480
forum and basically what we found was

448
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,000
that there wasn't that much of a

449
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
difference between the two of them

450
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,519
on the public forum there was a lot of

451
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,199
cases where actually there was just no

452
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,040
price advertised we can really figure

453
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,959
out what was the price of it but

454
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,880
basically what we saw was that most

455
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,199
malware was advertised in the hundreds

456
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,120
or the thousands of dollars

457
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,880
a few of them were actually

458
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,959
being sold for profit sharing for a

459
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,759
higher money but basically it was all

460
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,199
kind of similar

461
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,600
again in this case

462
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,759
finally the last thing we looked at was

463
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,360
kind of the profile of the vendors and

464
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,920
trying to see so did people establish

465
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,600
themselves on these forums and what we

466
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,800
saw was that when we were looking at the

467
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,519
reputation skills on the forums

468
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,920
in most cases on the public forum people

469
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,279
that really didn't invest in their

470
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,279
profiles they invest in their reputation

471
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,120
and most of that happened actually on

472
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,560
the private forum where people actually

473
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,959
establish themselves

474
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,880
and so kind of looking at this we were

475
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,600
kind of surprised by the results and

476
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,880
the first thing that we've actually

477
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,399
found was that you know there was few

478
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,399
differences actually in terms of the

479
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,600
price of the malware that was being

480
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,560
advertised uh how fresh this malware was

481
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,160
and this was kind of surprising because

482
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,560
we were expecting to find a lot more

483
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,360
differences in there and so the model

484
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,000
that we kind of had guest at which

485
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,360
everything would flow from the private

486
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,759
to the public forums uh maybe wasn't

487
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,759
kind of seen in our analysis and once

488
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,079
again this is very exploratory so there

489
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,000
will be more work to be done in this

490
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,079
field but basically that was already

491
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,359
something that was kind of interesting

492
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,599
to see kind of the lack of differences

493
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,839
between the two of them

494
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,000
one thing that we see was that on the

495
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,679
private forum at least people seem to

496
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,760
invest more in their profiles in their

497
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,119
reputation in building these

498
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,880
relationships and this is something

499
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,280
that's extremely important in any field

500
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,039
it can be you know professional computer

501
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,120
science professor or whatever

502
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,280
field it is extremely important to have

503
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,120
to establish your career and this will

504
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,200
change kind of the social networks and

505
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,039
who you can transact with but in this

506
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,120
case kind of the on the public forums it

507
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,960
seemed to be more fleeting and people

508
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,720
seem less interested in establishing

509
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,600
their uh their reputation

510
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,400
um one difference but of course uh it

511
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,240
was kind of interesting we we all know

512
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,320
that uh you know people usually from

513
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,919
russia are going to say that you

514
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,760
shouldn't attack resources in russia and

515
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,440
that's something that we saw in the

516
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
private forum

517
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,799
but in the end what was really

518
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,559
interesting was that people actually had

519
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,039
the choice in many cases to advertise on

520
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,360
public and private forums and people

521
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,200
just decided that they were still going

522
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,880
to go on public forum to advertise

523
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,799
products that were actually very similar

524
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,200
to what we find on the private forums

525
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,120
and so that was kind of very interesting

526
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,720
and it kind of talks about and this is

527
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,960
more kind of my criminology side but it

528
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,240
really talks about kind of the high

529
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,840
sense of impunity that you know these

530
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,760
threat taxes can have and to just

531
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,360
believe that you can advertise pretty

532
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,280
much anything and basically you can get

533
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,360
away with it and we had some examples of

534
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,799
sinkholing just before and people

535
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,039
getting arrested but in many cases it

536
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,200
just shows that there's still this high

537
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,760
sense of impunity among the community of

538
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,400
these malware vendors

539
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,160
and so to conclude um basically uh we do

540
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,400
need more validation for the differences

541
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,000
because this was just you know one

542
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,480
versus one and so this is a very limited

543
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,840
kind of study um there are a lot of

544
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,919
ethical considerations to consider and

545
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,400
this kind of explains why there's been

546
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,799
so few research being done on this

547
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,320
especially when you get into forums

548
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,840
where you want to be invited by the

549
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,880
members

550
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,960
you need to build up your persona online

551
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,720
it becomes extremely touchy and the

552
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,640
ethical boards usually don't want you to

553
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,000
lie to people

554
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,919
and so this has been kind of a challenge

555
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,840
to establish ourselves and to to be

556
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,600
invited to these forums that's something

557
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,919
that needs to be done however

558
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,160
and then the question becomes well what

559
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,400
is the role these forms and how

560
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,320
important are they really

561
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,320
and this is where kind of the question

562
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,400
of you know is going private really the

563
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,640
best models for these you know malware

564
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,280
vendors basically if you're on a very

565
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,880
small platform of course you're going to

566
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,360
have very few potential customers and if

567
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,200
you have very few potential customers it

568
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,400
means you're not going to be making as

569
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,880
many sales as you would like perhaps and

570
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,039
so this is an example of where you know

571
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,960
the private forums may just be too

572
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,200
exclusive and people may actually be

573
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,360
willing to trade off some of their

574
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,120
security to be more efficient and to be

575
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,120
making more profits because the private

576
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,960
forums are just too private and too

577
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,120
exclusive

578
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,120
now at the same time the question is

579
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,960
also well you know are people just

580
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,799
interested by these private forums and

581
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,960
have they moved on to other networks or

582
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,880
no there's you know countless telegram

583
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,559
channels we know there's countless

584
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,120
associations and personal relationships

585
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,559
and that's something that i've seen in

586
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,480
in other criminal communities

587
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,400
where basically you know when you go to

588
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,320
forums they may not just provide you

589
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,159
with the anonymity that you want and if

590
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,559
you want to have higher level uh malware

591
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,840
maybe you're gonna go somewhere else and

592
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,919
on these private forums who are just

593
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,440
even though they are more private they

594
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,480
are not private enough

595
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,320
so that's it for us thank you for

596
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,559
listening and if you have any

597
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,080
suggestions on how to take this project

598
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,320
forward i'd be glad to hear about it

599
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,590
thank you thank you

600
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:52,720
[Applause]

601
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,640
so do i have my slave with a mic

602
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,080
okay i'll be doing it for starting

603
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,960
so who has a question

604
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,200
yes

605
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,440
you're next i guess

606
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,799
thanks eric hi chris uh thanks very much

607
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,880
for a good presentation um just one

608
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,919
question

609
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,080
for me with a sort of takedown of raid

610
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,679
forums do you see

611
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,000
that have an effect and maybe moved more

612
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,400
towards private forums thanks

613
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,120
very good question so um we've seen

614
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,960
countless forms take down so i think

615
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,480
this is pretty much baked into a

616
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,960
community and people expect these forms

617
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,360
to be dying every single week

618
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,360
and that's why maybe people did not

619
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,440
invest as much in their online persona

620
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,200
on the public forums because they know

621
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,640
they're going to be more exposed and

622
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,039
more likely to be taken down

623
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,480
and even when you're looking at grid

624
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,400
forums i mean the scene recovered pretty

625
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,240
quickly people have moved to cracked

626
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,799
another forum and so people are kind of

627
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,799
used to it even though it's kind of uh

628
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,280
it adds a bit of friction um i think

629
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,799
that the model for private forum is good

630
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,480
but there's also a very big use to have

631
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,720
these vast pools of people and one of

632
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,480
the things that i've always found really

633
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,720
interesting is for people who who read

634
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,799
brian krebs for example he's going to be

635
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,559
talking about threat actors and very

636
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,400
often he'll be talking about tread

637
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,559
actors you would not expect to find on

638
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,720
hack forums which is you know often seen

639
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,440
as like a a kiddie scene but everyone

640
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,120
has an account on hack forums and i sure

641
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,440
if i ask over here at least a few people

642
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,039
have multiple accounts i'm sure hack

643
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,039
forums so basically these public forums

644
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,039
also serve a purpose and i don't see

645
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,320
them dying anytime soon

646
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,280
hi my name is uh simon thank you very

647
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,760
much for the presentation uh one

648
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,640
question i had was whether you

649
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,240
took a look or plan to take a look at

650
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,159
over services because you're focused on

651
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,960
malware but maybe some other things such

652
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,080
as bulletproof hosting or

653
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,600
selling a

654
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,159
compromised account somewhere

655
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,240
well did you plan to take a look at that

656
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,039
yeah so thank you for the question um

657
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,840
yes and then there are so many things to

658
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,320
sell on the criminal underground um we

659
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,480
tried to remain as focused as we could

660
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,480
and even looking at malware like it was

661
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,720
such a simplification of what malware is

662
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,360
is what we did and i we fully recognize

663
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,200
that but it would be extremely

664
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,960
interesting to look at other types you

665
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,120
know the stolen accounts for example and

666
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,120
to see where these accounts are being

667
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,600
bought from and how important is that

668
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,919
the context you know with genesis that

669
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,679
we see popping up in the russian market

670
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,919
as well um they would be very fruitful

671
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,480
to look at um as soon as we hired more

672
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,400
people to to work on this project

673
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,720
i have to say remaining focus was really

674
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,320
important there was also a sort of

675
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,400
entertainment value on reading all these

676
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,080
exchanges on the

677
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,159
on the forums and discovering the depth

678
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,559
of what was being what was being offered

679
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,720
at least for me it was like newer to the

680
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,480
scene it was like

681
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,600
oh okay so this is happening so yeah

682
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,039
we're there

683
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,640
yeah hello my name is gary thank you

684
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,039
much for the presentation and i have two

685
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,440
questions the first one

686
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,000
are you in contact with flaw enforcement

687
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,559
so that when a forum

688
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,640
when there is a takedown so that you

689
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,720
have the chance to maybe get

690
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,039
an image of the server so that you have

691
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,159
more data for for analysis

692
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,960
and the second question

693
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,240
do you inform let's say companies when

694
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,919
when you see

695
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,960
access credentials in in the forum

696
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,039
or exercises

697
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,720
sold

698
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,600
so

699
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,520
i don't want to insult any law

700
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,760
enforcement in the room

701
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,720
but

702
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,559
over the past few years i must at least

703
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,520
on my end i've given more than i've

704
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,840
received from law

705
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,120
enforcement you want to get arrested you

706
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,840
want to get arrested

707
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,679
you know sometimes i think i know enough

708
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,039
law enforcement that they could gather

709
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,960
of anything but yeah that still remains

710
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,320
to be seen

711
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,320
but in terms of images i mean i've been

712
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,360
promised

713
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,600
many images over time

714
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,840
at least with academics it's i found it

715
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,159
pretty difficult to receive anything to

716
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,000
so it's more of a one-way street but i'm

717
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,760
really hoping that will change in the

718
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,440
future

719
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,039
and in terms of sending in information

720
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,440
once again i think as academics we kind

721
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,320
of stand in the middle between everyone

722
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,799
and basically our goal is more to inform

723
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,200
um and i'm more than happy to answer any

724
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,480
questions that you know any law

725
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,360
enforcement has or offender have we the

726
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,120
goal is kind of to present this is the

727
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,679
reality and this is what we found and

728
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,360
then you guys use it as best as you can

729
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,320
okay thank you we have been

730
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
in communication with law enforcement on

731
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,679
our institute side not only on cyber

732
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,000
crime but in general and i have to say

733
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,679
in the in the in the last year this

734
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,440
communication as we get to know each

735
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,240
other

736
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,799
better as has become really more

737
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,480
profitable and i i think that the

738
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,720
boundaries are are clearly set on what

739
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,880
is our objective and and what is their

740
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,880
objectives but but i think this this

741
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,159
line of communication the more we

742
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,720
communicate the the better we can

743
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,279
establish connections and exchange data

744
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,520
also obviously within what we can do and

745
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,200
what they can do on their end

746
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,640
hey thank you for the talk guys with

747
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,799
likana kaspersky uh question like can

748
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,720
you share maybe some tips or advice to

749
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,080
the researchers in the audience like

750
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,559
what's the best way to infiltrate such

751
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,919
forums and also to do the automatic um

752
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,159
information gathering like crawling any

753
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,520
advice on that

754
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,559
um

755
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,559
so infiltration

756
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,400
at least as academics we are very

757
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,320
limited unfortunately as to what we can

758
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,600
do

759
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,080
i actually just got my first ever

760
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,919
permission to lie to people to do

761
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,360
research so that's kind of quite

762
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,720
exciting

763
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,320
we'll see how that goes and if i get

764
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,159
arrested at some point

765
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,120
but but basically so we we are limited

766
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,880
to just saying not much or buying access

767
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,640
so that seems to be fine so we get

768
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,720
actually paid to have access and that's

769
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,559
kind of what we did for this forum over

770
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,440
here um and and so in terms of

771
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,880
infiltration i think in the private

772
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,399
sector there's a lot more that you can

773
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,480
do to create your fake profiles and to

774
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,320
do your research and i think this is

775
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,080
where it comes becomes very valuable

776
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,919
because it's kind of a different

777
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:30,880
approach

778
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,320
um

779
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,919
and then the second part of your

780
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,320
question was about crawling or indexing

781
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,399
the content um

782
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,760
i mean

783
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,080
the the the problem is always what your

784
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,559
goal is if you want to scrape data from

785
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,520
one forum one time extremely easy i mean

786
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,720
that's 1994 technology if you want to do

787
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,520
it consistently every week on large

788
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,360
marketplaces this is where it becomes

789
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,240
extremely painful and difficult and i've

790
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
built my own kind of infrastructure and

791
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,720
data collection technology

792
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,600
and

793
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,640
more and more i think that it's a low

794
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,440
added value uh procedure and it's better

795
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,919
to let to give that to professionals who

796
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,399
only do that and then we can take this

797
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,640
data and add the value to it and i think

798
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,279
that's kind of where the future is and i

799
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,279
love collecting all of my data but if it

800
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,120
doesn't leave you any time to analyze it

801
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,880
then what's the point of having these

802
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,120
terabytes of data and so more and more i

803
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,279
think kind of moving forward we're going

804
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,279
to go to a field where we have companies

805
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,159
whose only goal is to siphon off this

806
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,000
data and then we can actually give

807
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,840
meaning to it and then do interesting

808
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,760
stuff with it

809
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,679
okay last question

810
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,840
on this

811
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,360
side you're in between us and the lunch

812
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,600
okay i'll not take much time uh

813
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,399
yeah

814
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,320
a nice presentation i have a question

815
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,440
it's

816
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,080
or do you have done any study or are you

817
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,960
doing any study where which is like

818
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,360
targeting a particular industry the

819
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,760
malware of the forums are active

820
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,480
um no so in this case it was

821
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,640
you know we we don't so we have a paper

822
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,559
i can share around to people who are

823
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,559
interested with more definitions of what

824
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,679
is what

825
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,279
but in this case we wanted to be as

826
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,120
broad as possible so you know any

827
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,039
malware

828
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,559
product that was for sale but it was

829
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,000
really a broad definition of what

830
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,440
malware is

831
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,320
just to be as inclusive as possible and

832
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,000
once again there was thousands and

833
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,760
thousands of threads and messages that

834
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,919
we had to read and then we ended up with

835
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,880
a sample of about 220 malware that were

836
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,120
for sale so it was a lot of work for in

837
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,240
the end not that many malware and this

838
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,520
is where kind of the problem of the

839
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,960
scale is we have to do all of this

840
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,520
manually and this is quite complicated

841
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,600
um doing especially doing all the open

842
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,279
