1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,320
wisdom and seminars are going to talk

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,960
about the rtm botnet

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,560
so it's not read the manual or something

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,120
like that it's

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,840
you have the

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,000
floor um

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,240
so um hello

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,840
hello and good morning everyone um

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,760
today

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,840
we'll talk about rtm.net it's

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,960
quite old nowadays

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,760
and

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,200
we'll tell you how we shut down

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,480
this botnet how we think hold it first

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,920
and

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,399
this talk will sound weird for you

17
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,719
nowadays because

18
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,399
the situation

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,280
changed crazy

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,399
actually

21
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,440
this case started in 2019

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,400
for me

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,640
and uh it's about how the collaboration

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,320
between five different countries

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,320
russia ukraine

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,840
singapore

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,280
germany and bulgaria helped to

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,720
collect enough evidences to arrest

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,040
the main developer and the main leader

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,320
of behind this botnet

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,840
and um

32
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,600
firstly

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,560
i thought about changing the topic but i

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,079
decided okay it

35
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,960
still important to show how

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,520
this collaboration between law

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,920
enforcement agencies

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,720
help

39
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,360
people to

40
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,960
protect against

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,399
and fight against cyber crime

42
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,320
a few words about us so my name is

43
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,000
rustam mirkasimov

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,040
i joined group ib eight years ago and

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,719
i'm i started as malware analyst in

46
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,959
threat intelligence department and my

47
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,599
responsibility is to track

48
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,599
cyber crime and state-sponsored hacking

49
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,560
groups

50
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
and my name is siman rogachov i have

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,720
joined group ib for more than four years

52
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,840
ago

53
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
i have started as a malware analyst and

54
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,680
currently i'm also an incident responder

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,280
but i still extremely interested in the

56
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,959
reverse engineering

57
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,400
so let's start the topic

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,959
yeah and

59
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,879
i want to make some

60
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,560
history introduction

61
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,599
so um it's it's not a secret that

62
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,440
russian-speaking countries

63
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,760
is the main exporter of

64
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,640
cybercrime and

65
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,080
banking

66
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,280
trojans

67
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,720
to

68
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,920
europe

69
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,160
and

70
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,519
western world

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,920
since in 2008

72
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,879
zeus

73
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,040
made a revolution in

74
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,120
banking trojans

75
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,720
and

76
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,080
in since 2008 to i think 2016 or 17 most

77
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,800
of

78
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
hacking groups which attack financial

79
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,680
organizations and banks were russian

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,800
speaking

81
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,680
and

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,920
their tactic is that

83
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,000
they start to

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,040
test their tools their trojans in

85
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,239
in their homelands like russia ukraine

86
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,920
republic of kazakhstan and other former

87
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,560
soviet union countries and then they

88
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,120
start to attack

89
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,239
organizations in europe and united

90
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,319
states so

91
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,120
and

92
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,040
interestingly that

93
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,560
some of

94
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,239
hacking groups here

95
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,799
like annonack corco when one ends

96
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,159
i mean when we register that

97
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,120
some group stop their operations and

98
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,879
other immediately starts

99
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,040
so

100
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,760
it is not a secret that even nowadays

101
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,560
this

102
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,040
people in i mean members of those

103
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,160
hacking groups they change

104
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,199
they change their groups like

105
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,000
they leave one they enter other groups

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,199
and

107
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,840
you can't say okay this

108
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,240
this affiliates work only with this

109
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,360
ransomware group so it's a

110
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,560
continuous process and some people

111
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,479
participate in different groups and so

112
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,800
on and um

113
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,800
i think the best example of that uh

114
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,080
is uh

115
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,280
born of cobalt group so uh when

116
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,680
ananak or carbonac

117
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,280
as uh

118
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,199
some of you called them

119
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,479
uh stop their operation some

120
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,600
some

121
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,280
some members of this group were arrested

122
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,560
uh

123
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,199
other teammates who

124
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,479
who

125
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,320
were able to remain

126
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,360
to remain unpunished they moved their

127
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,759
operations to other locations other

128
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,720
regions

129
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,680
and

130
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,960
founded

131
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,280
such groups like finn seven

132
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,199
kabul

133
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,440
bottra and others and

134
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,600
the story about

135
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,440
a guy

136
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,919
let's name him fox it is not that fox in

137
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,800
telegram channel some of you know him

138
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,520
and other fox

139
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,000
so

140
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,520
i think in 2015

141
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,320
or 14

142
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,440
russian

143
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,680
russian police

144
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,600
investigated ananak attacks and

145
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,120
one of guys there

146
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,880
he was just an operator and

147
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,840
he

148
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,240
made some

149
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,880
lateral movement in a targeted

150
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,680
organization and to do that he used a

151
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,360
vpn

152
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,680
which was stolen from that organization

153
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,800
and in the end of his working day

154
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,520
he forgot to

155
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,080
switch off his vpn and order pizza to

156
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,319
his house

157
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,520
yeah

158
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,600
but uh

159
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,639
but

160
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,199
destiny gave him a chance

161
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,400
uh

162
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
law enforcement was able to collect

163
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,199
enough evidences so uh he

164
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,840
he just received a probation period

165
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,880
and what do you think he started to do

166
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,759
so

167
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,000
since the group was this banned he

168
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,520
decided okay now i know a lot

169
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,199
a lot about

170
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,800
hacking attacks

171
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,599
and he decided to

172
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,039
write his own

173
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,960
botnet and

174
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,680
make new group

175
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,440
and this is how rtm was made

176
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,560
so

177
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,080
to make a little bit more familiar with

178
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,319
the rtm let's start from the basic

179
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,840
attack overview

180
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,160
so uh the first

181
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,080
stage is the

182
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,120
initial access establishing stage

183
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,440
it was made by the rtm via the two

184
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,759
different ways the first way is pretty

185
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,160
common it's a spearfishing

186
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,199
it it was done by bo from both

187
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,400
compromised emails or fake emails

188
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,199
they especially frequently used fake

189
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,080
emails of different government

190
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,800
services in russia especially original

191
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,759
ones

192
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,240
uh since a lot of

193
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,720
services government services in regions

194
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,160
in russia don't use dkim spf dmarc

195
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,440
something like that

196
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,039
not all of these phishing emails were

197
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,039
blocked at the same time there was

198
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,879
another way to establish an initial

199
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,120
access and it was a way via the

200
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,960
compromised websites for financial

201
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,919
specialists just for example after the

202
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,479
initial after the financial site is

203
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,720
compromised some exploit back with the

204
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,440
payload is uploaded to it and as soon as

205
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,319
a vulnerable victim goes to the site it

206
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,120
receives a payload um in our

207
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,360
investigated cases the payload was a

208
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,000
reconnaissance module uh which in

209
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,039
different cases either uploaded to the

210
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,279
host or to the infected host or book

211
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,080
trap

212
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,120
which is once again extremely uh famous

213
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,320
um

214
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,640
attack group uh on the territory of the

215
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,680
x-ussr or the rtm modules

216
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,560
so

217
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,279
after the initial after the host is

218
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,880
compromised

219
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,080
the rtm recon module uh is started

220
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,480
so rtm recon module is a pretty basic

221
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,399
thing which doesn't conduct any

222
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,440
malicious activity it simply checks if

223
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,839
this exact host is related to some kind

224
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,399
of financial activity of the company

225
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,360
uh depending on the um

226
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,080
depending on the results like after the

227
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,279
check uh it either downloads the rtm

228
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,360
core with different modules which allows

229
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,640
to con to pro to conduct the full attack

230
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,200
and to withdraw the money or it simply

231
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,519
downloads the pony stealer for example

232
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,200
which also allows to harvest some

233
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,440
credentials but still it doesn't lead to

234
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,640
some kind of a money stealing or

235
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,000
something like that

236
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,480
so let's move on

237
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,240
uh let's start from discussing of the

238
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,000
first stage uh the first stage is

239
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,560
obviously required in a sense and it

240
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,440
actually contains two different steps

241
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,760
the first step is to check browser

242
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,480
history for the presence of different uh

243
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,560
financial banking organization in

244
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,560
history etc etc

245
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,519
um

246
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,320
i believe there were like 20 or even

247
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,920
more banks listed in all the indicators

248
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,079
but on the screen you can see like uh

249
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,519
six most

250
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,560
most famous of them uh probably vtb and

251
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,640
alpha bank are not familiar not known

252
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,880
for you but it's uh

253
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,040
quite big banks in russia

254
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,720
uh also i believe you have heard about

255
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,040
this burbank about the rifaizen western

256
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,079
union blockchain so rtm operators are

257
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,959
also interested in the cryptocurrency

258
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,240
as you can see

259
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,720
blockchain is listed right here

260
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,200
so the first stage is to check the

261
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,079
presence of these indicators

262
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,240
in the browser history

263
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,279
thank you

264
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,600
the second stage is to check the file

265
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,519
system the file system is checked for

266
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,200
the presence for

267
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,120
of about 15 different uh 15 different

268
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,680
banking services

269
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,480
at the same time once again i believe i

270
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,800
have listed the most famous and the most

271
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,040
interesting of them right here

272
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,279
the first one is the dns

273
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,240
it's let me explain i believe some of

274
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
you are familiar with such a thing as

275
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,079
sap right

276
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,360
uh what addiness is in fact pretty much

277
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,120
the same thing which allows an

278
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,560
accountant to

279
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,560
pay the taxes to

280
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,399
pay the salaries to calculate the

281
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,920
holidays of the employees etc etc so it

282
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,560
is extremely extremely popular i would

283
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,240
even say it's the only thing which is

284
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,560
used on the territory of the ex-ussr

285
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,440
countries to do this kind of an activity

286
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,360
and of course there are another

287
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,079
different uh software which is also

288
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,680
related to the banks to the crypto

289
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,480
wallets and so on and so on so after the

290
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
first stage

291
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,560
reconnaissance is finished the recon

292
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,959
module uh sends a http get request to

293
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,120
its command and control server

294
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,000
and depending on if some of the

295
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,839
indicators will find the node if you

296
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,200
found the node

297
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,959
he modifies the

298
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,360
the request parameter and the command

299
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,279
and control server either returns the

300
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,560
rtm core with modules or returns the

301
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,399
simple bonus tiller

302
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,680
so the second stage is a core module

303
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,320
the list of the modules are presented on

304
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,760
the screen right now

305
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,560
uh

306
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,480
if you are interested in some kind of a

307
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,560
deep understanding watch what these

308
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,959
modules actually do you can find the

309
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,680
reports of the eset team of our team or

310
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,279
i believe bizon also have made the

311
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,440
research of this thing

312
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,959
long story short it allows

313
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,440
an rtm operator to fully control the

314
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,839
remote host which is infected with rtm

315
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,920
capabilities are pretty common for this

316
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,320
kind of malware

317
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,600
this is the ending of the previous slide

318
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
as you can see it also allows to do the

319
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,760
dbo scan which is pretty much the same

320
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,959
thing which is made by the

321
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,760
reconnaissance module so once again

322
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,920
nothing extremely unusual in the

323
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,680
capabilities of this malware

324
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,000
the third stage is about the running the

325
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,880
modules the modules in fact allow to do

326
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,920
the

327
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,560
credential harvesting via the different

328
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,880
in the different ways to do the network

329
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,279
scanning via the irp

330
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,680
requests uh something like that where

331
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,480
the um active directory scanning and so

332
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,560
on and so on so

333
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,880
these modules of course uh extend the

334
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,120
capabilities of the rtm but once again

335
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,279
if you can list if you can check them

336
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,519
and you can see them uh nothing

337
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,680
extremely unusual is presented right

338
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,200
here so rtm

339
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,839
has a pretty common capabilities nothing

340
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,680
extremely suspicious

341
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,120
so after right now since now we know uh

342
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,279
how the attacks actually made let's

343
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,920
discuss the last stage of the attack an

344
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,720
impact stage

345
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,600
so

346
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,680
as i've already said uh the most of the

347
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,800
rtm attacks led to the money withdrawal

348
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
and these are the things which are made

349
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,320
via the rdp or teamviewer or via the one

350
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,959
s2kl module

351
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,720
so uh rdmo teamviewer well pretty basic

352
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,920
thing uh rtm simply uploaded the hidden

353
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,680
ver uh the modified version of the

354
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,000
teamviewer teamviewer is an extremely

355
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,519
popular remote access tool in russia and

356
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,160
our countries

357
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,480
so via the team viewer

358
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,880
an rtm operator simply could connect to

359
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,320
the remote host

360
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,959
and simply create a

361
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,199
payment payment or something like that

362
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,040
to withdraw the money

363
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,440
also the rdp was used for the same

364
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,839
purpose so nothing suspicious or nothing

365
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,800
unusual right here one is to kl module

366
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,199
which was frequently used previously but

367
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,600
in the latest attacks rtm usually uses a

368
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
teamwork modified version

369
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,760
so one s2ka is

370
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,560
based once again on the software which

371
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,839
is called 1s

372
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,320
which i have already mentioned

373
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,880
it injects to its process and there is a

374
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,639
specific file which is 1s2kl

375
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,440
and this file actually contains all the

376
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,120
payments data which should be done by

377
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,320
this program

378
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,040
in fact after an attacker hooks all the

379
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,720
functions which are responsible for

380
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,279
writing data to this exact module to

381
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,920
this exact txt file it has a full

382
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,160
control of the payment services of the

383
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,320
company and this full control is

384
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,800
invisible for for an accountant like for

385
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,600
example he types into the field an

386
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,440
absolutely correct

387
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,360
account number or something like that

388
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,279
but the same time since the hook is

389
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,759
invisible for for an accountant

390
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,320
the date is modified and

391
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,759
the transaction data is uh is changed

392
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,880
also

393
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,800
uh we have seen how rtm operators

394
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,639
deploy the ransomware

395
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,199
and this is a pretty funny thing because

396
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,759
hype train goes to too

397
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,680
ransomware was deployed several times

398
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,000
via the it rtm this is not the thing

399
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,920
that we expected but still

400
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,399
uh nowadays it looks like every single

401
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,079
person tries to

402
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,240
deploy a ransomware

403
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,720
so now let's get closer to the fact that

404
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,959
allowed us to hijack the malware

405
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,560
the rtm operators rtm developers never

406
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,120
used common ways to obtain

407
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,279
an ip address of the remote of the

408
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,279
command control server

409
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,600
the first approach which they have used

410
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
was related to the

411
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,680
live journal you can see the screen

412
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,920
right now

413
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,279
live journal

414
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,880
is

415
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,040
one of the oldest i believe

416
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,959
one of the oldest

417
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,120
social networks on the territory of the

418
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,880
ex-ussr countries

419
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,040
so basically on the screen you can see

420
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,639
one of the posts

421
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,839
which are made by the rtm operators

422
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,639
and as you can see there is a 40 there

423
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,399
is an opening and closing brackets with

424
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,000
the number 40 inside of it it's an

425
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,480
indicator of the

426
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,120
its indicator of the rtm group and

427
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,440
between these brackets you can see uh

428
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,639
the encrypted data about which server

429
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,199
should be used as a remote command and

430
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,679
control server in this case

431
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,400
afterwards they have evolved to usage of

432
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,079
the dot bit domains

433
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,839
dot b domains are specific dns domains

434
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,280
which use

435
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,520
name coin technology

436
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,720
and it allowed them to

437
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,439
to

438
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,079
to be protected from uh and delegation

439
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,679
of the dns

440
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,160
dna sentries

441
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,640
and the third stage which they have used

442
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
and it was the last one and there was a

443
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,880
huge mistake in this thing uh they

444
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,640
decided to leverage the bitcoin

445
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,600
technology even more and they have tr

446
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,679
have started to use the bitcoin-based

447
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,960
algorithm

448
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,200
so the bitcoin based algorithm uh

449
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,760
contained three steps the first step is

450
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,080
to obtain an information about the

451
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,960
transactions of exact wallet from the

452
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,600
block cipher api

453
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,000
that's the first step the second step is

454
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,200
to

455
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,440
obtain information about last two

456
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,760
transactions

457
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,240
calculate the value of it and transform

458
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,160
it to the comment and control address i

459
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,760
will show you an example for a better

460
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,520
understanding a little bit later but

461
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,320
there was a huge mistake made by the rtm

462
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,960
developers they haven't checked

463
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,679
uh what which wallet the transaction

464
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,400
came from it means that in fact every

465
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,799
single person which has enough block

466
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,520
which has an ass which has enough

467
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,200
uh bitcoin is able to change the address

468
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,880
of the command and control server of the

469
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,280
rtm

470
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,960
so here's the example

471
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,760
uh

472
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,000
this information which you can see on

473
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,840
the left part of the screen

474
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,480
is uh is just a json which is returned

475
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,039
by the block cipher api

476
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,880
and right here i want you to pay your

477
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,120
attention to the value field value in

478
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,559
fact is amount of money which is

479
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,840
transferred and rtm takes two last

480
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,480
transaction data to obtain the command

481
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,160
and control server as you can see we

482
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,720
have the transaction number 53

483
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,200
and its value if 35 431 right so the

484
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,360
first step which is made by the rtm

485
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,559
executable

486
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,039
is translation of this value to the

487
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,679
hexadecimal number which is two bytes

488
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,160
and it always is two bytes they do these

489
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,760
kind of transactions

490
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,640
as you can see it's 8a67

491
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,360
and afterwards after that since it's a

492
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,720
little endian

493
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,240
um

494
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,640
the sequence of bytes is changed and 67

495
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,200
goes to 103 and

496
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,480
a goes to the 138 if some of you have a

497
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,360
calculator i believe we can check this

498
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,280
this is the first transaction data and

499
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,559
the second transaction data is done is

500
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,039
proceeded to be the same way

501
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,840
but in this case we have 91 and 200

502
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,880
numbers

503
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,280
so the second transaction data is the

504
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,120
first two octets of the ap address of

505
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,679
the remote common control server and the

506
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,480
value of the first transaction is two

507
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,240
last octets

508
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
so this algorithm gives us an

509
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,320
opportunity to calculate the remote

510
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,880
command and control server address

511
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,440
so once again we have this algorithm and

512
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,280
we have an understanding of after

513
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,360
reverse engineering of the samples that

514
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,600
no additional validation is made

515
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,240
this is an important thing

516
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,200
you can do exactly the same

517
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,760
calculations from the block cipher api

518
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,080
like here's a little bit better human

519
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,120
readable

520
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,840
thing like you can see that the value is

521
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,159
35

522
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:44,720
431 and 51 291 it leads uh it gives us

523
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,360
another ap address and this ap addresses

524
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,240
according to our research i changed like

525
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,039
two once in a two or three days in some

526
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,640
of the cases it happens more frequently

527
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,840
but still

528
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,440
this is an example from the first

529
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,600
december of tohan of 2019 i believe

530
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,880
so

531
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,880
after after i received this

532
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,840
report uh malware engineering report

533
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,320
reverse engineering report from simeon i

534
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,039
decided okay first of all we can track

535
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,480
in real time all new command and control

536
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,240
servers used by rtm.net so

537
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,000
i wrote simple

538
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,480
python snippet to

539
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,640
to

540
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,440
collect those ip addresses and put them

541
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,080
into our system and we provided them to

542
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,600
our customers so they were able to uh to

543
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,840
put these ips into

544
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,120
their defending solutions

545
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,400
even before those samples

546
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,520
has been delivered to to them

547
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,799
and uh another thing

548
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,400
uh one

549
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,840
one of

550
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,760
of uh those servers

551
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,159
was located in singapore

552
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,600
so

553
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,799
with help of my colleagues who work with

554
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,600
interpol we reached out to

555
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
singaporean police and

556
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,159
seized the server

557
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,280
the same

558
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,640
was done with another server in bulgaria

559
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,240
and on both servers we found

560
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,559
that both of them were used as just a

561
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,960
proxy service and they redirect traffic

562
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,240
to

563
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,840
exactly the same

564
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,720
ip address 91.200.103.39

565
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,520
and

566
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,559
according according to

567
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,360
our graph this server was

568
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,760
deployed like

569
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,679
two two years ago so seems like uh in

570
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,000
in two years

571
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,559
rtm gang didn't

572
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,760
change

573
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,520
the real back end so they only

574
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,200
they only change

575
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,080
the proxy front ends

576
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,360
and

577
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,120
this server was

578
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,120
located in germany and

579
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,400
so

580
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,880
we started to think how we can

581
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,799
how we can make this process clear

582
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,960
because according to

583
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,919
german legislation it is quite difficult

584
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,480
to make such requests to them so

585
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,159
they they can seize but they cannot

586
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,679
provide it back to us

587
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,559
i will explain later how we

588
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,320
process that stuff so we decided okay

589
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,360
now uh we know how to

590
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,720
change

591
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,240
the

592
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,039
how to change this bitcoin wallet how to

593
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,840
send transactions so we wanted to

594
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,440
sinkhole

595
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,480
the botnet to understand how many

596
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,080
compromised machines are there and

597
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,640
take measures to

598
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,240
notify big organizations

599
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,600
and uh it's important here that

600
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,559
uh

601
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,600
it was really important for us

602
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,000
not to make any

603
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,480
any direct

604
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,720
interactions with

605
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,960
with those compromised machines so we

606
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,320
wanted just to redirect traffic to our

607
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,279
server

608
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,760
sniff it analyze and don't send any

609
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,600
active commands

610
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,720
or any traffic to

611
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,919
to compromised machines

612
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,840
so uh

613
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,679
first first issue we faced was that

614
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,039
rtm

615
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,799
used quite

616
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,480
old

617
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
quite old

618
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,880
wallets

619
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,000
and

620
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,559
we created a new

621
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,440
segwit back 32

622
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,320
bitcoin wallet and the problem with it

623
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,240
was that there is a limit uh a minimum

624
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,039
amount of bitcoins you can send

625
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,279
by one transaction

626
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,559
and

627
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,000
we rented a server with ap address

628
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
5.2.67.50

629
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,760
and to send

630
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,600
first octet

631
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,520
we had to

632
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,039
send

633
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,279
this uh amount of bitcoins and with a

634
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,559
new

635
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,320
new segwit uh

636
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,679
wallets it

637
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,520
it wasn't possible

638
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,720
so happily we did that

639
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,799
during testing attempt

640
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,640
and

641
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,960
also it was important to

642
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,480
determine the

643
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,919
the fee

644
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,240
so uh if you

645
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,440
make your transaction with lower fee

646
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,120
it is possible that it will not uh

647
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,960
be sent to the target wallet in time

648
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,679
and uh during

649
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,559
during so we we started to wait when the

650
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,840
rtm operators will change their uh

651
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,760
command and control server

652
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,520
to start immediately

653
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,960
our operation

654
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,440
and uh unfortunately

655
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,600
when when we started to do that we chose

656
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,640
low fee

657
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
so it wasn't correct and our

658
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
transactions uh

659
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,360
were received by the wallet in wrong

660
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,600
sequence so

661
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,559
our

662
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,360
last octets uh came first

663
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,360
and uh it was a mess

664
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,200
but uh luckily for us rtm operators

665
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,120
didn't notice anything so they issu they

666
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,240
published

667
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,600
they made a patch in rtm trojan just uh

668
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,919
after two days later

669
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,120
so we had the time to sinkhole to to fix

670
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,320
our mistake and to uh redirect traffic

671
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,840
from all botnets to our own

672
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,000
server and uh

673
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,919
the analysis of

674
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,039
of that showed that

675
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,240
we

676
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,000
received a registration request from

677
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,039
more than

678
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,399
3 000 hosts

679
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,880
six different languages were installed

680
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,520
so we analyzed registration requests

681
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,240
from compromised machines and

682
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,919
there were

683
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,000
six different languages installed on

684
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,480
those in the uh in uncompromised

685
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,520
machines

686
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,840
and

687
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,480
so overall

688
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,480
it took almost two years to

689
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,000
collect evidences and to make this a

690
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,960
rest

691
