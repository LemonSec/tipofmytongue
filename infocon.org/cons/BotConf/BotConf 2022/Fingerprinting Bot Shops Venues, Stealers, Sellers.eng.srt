1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,199
so now for the next talk uh we're back

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,799
um to have a look at uh

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,800
black markets uh

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,360
and the cybercrime ecosystem

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,080
with uh brian and austin you have the

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,640
floor

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,119
great uh thank you so much eric and

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,039
thank you everyone for coming back after

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,119
the coffee break um

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,560
it's exciting to get this time slot

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,320
because everyone's awake but hopefully

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,800
we'll try and keep it that way so

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,400
my name name's brian oliver i'm a team

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,600
lead of flashpoint taking charge of um

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,079
rfis which are client requests and my

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,440
colleague austin i'll give him a chance

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,680
to introduce himself

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,920
hello everyone my name is austin terczyk

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,160
i am a senior analyst at flashpoint

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,079
focusing on

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,000
exploits and information stealing

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,399
malware

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,280
so today we're going to look at malware

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,600
holistically steeler malware and

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,039
specifically

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,320
so uh yeah scalar malware um

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,239
info steelers also as they're known um

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,280
and we'll also look at a macro view

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,040
of sort of quantitative data from the

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,680
largest bot shops and steeler malware

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,439
that's being distributed um so we'll

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,119
start off a little bit about uh

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,360
describing the ecosystem how it works um

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,119
just to give a more general overview and

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,159
we'll go through that i guess a little

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,320
bit faster and then slow down for a

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,840
little bit and talk about some of what

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,840
we've learned from doing a

39
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,479
macro analysis of the largest shops

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,840
um so just to give a little bit of the

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,880
outline

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,000
we have the ecosystem as a whole um you

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,600
know how is steeler malware operating

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,200
why is this important why do we care

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,720
about it

46
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,360
monetization which is i think probably

47
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,720
at least for me doing the research where

48
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,640
the largest surprises came and i still

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,000
think that's one of the most innovative

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,960
areas

51
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,640
of this field

52
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,920
and then the trends coming from the

53
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,680
macro data geography volume all the

54
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,280
different things you can use

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,600
say as infosec analysis to help inform

56
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,119
defense policy

57
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,799
um evolution how these things have been

58
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,000
changing the

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,960
ingenuity and remarkable um just

60
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,280
evolution the way the malware changes

61
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,040
um and is so

62
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,000
uh

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,119
you know what the word i'm looking for

64
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,959
but just so innovative in ways that we

65
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,318
wouldn't even really expect and is

66
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,480
always surprising um and then finally

67
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,920
we'll look at some of the updates to

68
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,840
malware how we can pull these updates

69
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,000
directly from um

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,200
sort of release announcements on the

71
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,040
forums and use that to

72
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,120
explore how malware changes in the

73
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,720
market so to go from a update release to

74
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,319
then look at how that affects sales all

75
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,239
the way down the line in the chain and

76
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,000
then finally a brief look at how we can

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,840
use this information in mitigation

78
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,319
to start off operation and ecosystem and

79
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,080
i'll go through this relatively briefly

80
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,680
since i think a lot of people here are

81
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,040
already somewhat familiar with this

82
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,519
process um but we can also slow down i'm

83
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,800
happy to take questions at the end of

84
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,239
course but

85
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,920
in brief on steeler malware as you can

86
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,800
see from this chart right um we start by

87
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,319
renting an info stealer and

88
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,400
traditionally this is taking place on

89
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,640
probably xss exploit of course as well

90
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,560
um are the two main forums for renting

91
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,239
infosteeler malware

92
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,080
you will see it on other forums bhf

93
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,840
sometimes has it um but primarily it's

94
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,840
those two forums and they're renting out

95
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,959
access to an executable in a panel and

96
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,040
once that malware is rented out then

97
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,560
various other threat actors distribute

98
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,560
it typically via mouse spam

99
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,400
um and then they exfiltrate what are

100
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,200
known as logs from the victim computer

101
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
so they distribute the malware um they

102
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
get all of the logs back either to a c2

103
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,200
server or sometimes it's integrated to

104
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,799
telegram

105
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,360
and then those logs are either sold to

106
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,519
bot shops to cloud services we'll talk

107
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,720
more about both

108
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,760
um or

109
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,159
used by the threat actors themselves um

110
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,599
usually to cash out either a bank

111
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,760
account or cryptocurrency account

112
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,159
um but that's the overall process you

113
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,400
rent out malware you distribute it you

114
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,760
receive it and if you receive it in

115
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,760
large enough quantities you resell it if

116
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,799
you receive it in small enough

117
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,080
quantities if you're a smaller

118
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,840
independent actor you're just looking

119
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,360
for whatever is your specific niche

120
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,200
whether that's um a bank account a

121
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,879
cryptocurrency account a social media

122
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,560
account um and we'll talk more about

123
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,519
that in monetization

124
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,280
um so why is this important though right

125
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
why are we talking about this now

126
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,720
um and i think the interesting thing

127
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,319
about this is it's really starting to

128
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,879
replace some of the long-lived trends

129
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,120
that we've seen in the past specifically

130
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,720
the credential stuffing brute forcing

131
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,000
ecosystem

132
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,040
and i use those two terms

133
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,238
interchangeably even though they're not

134
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,358
the same thing

135
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,199
and we can get into brute forces they're

136
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,280
fascinating tools as well

137
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,639
but for the purposes of this

138
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,160
presentation because threat actors refer

139
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,080
to them both as brutes credential

140
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,759
stuffers brute forcers will use the two

141
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,919
terms interchangeably and the way that

142
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,919
this used to work is raid forums which

143
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,840
of course has recently gone down but

144
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,600
there are other forums as well nulled

145
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,440
various other ones that sell or just

146
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,600
make freely available on these large

147
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,080
username password databases um so you

148
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,440
acquire a database that costs usually

149
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,960
around four dollars on raid i think was

150
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,800
the going rate um for something that can

151
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,400
be anywhere from

152
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,639
a few thousand to a few million lines of

153
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,720
plain text email and password you load

154
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,160
that into a credential stuffer usually

155
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,440
it's open bullet because you can get it

156
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,440
on github um but you know waxy private

157
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,880
keeper you know you have your whole

158
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,320
choice of these things

159
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,560
um and then you can spray those combos

160
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,039
against any website you want right um

161
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,960
if you know people who use the

162
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,880
free streaming to try and bypass you

163
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,960
know netflix or other hulu other

164
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,800
streaming platforms oftentimes it's

165
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,560
coming from those um accounts which are

166
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,400
gained through credential stuffing um

167
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,840
bank accounts same sort of thing so

168
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,680
that's traditionally how this has worked

169
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,560
right

170
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,320
you buy the username password you spread

171
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,080
against 100 different sites you check

172
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,759
the ones that are valid and then you

173
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,160
either monetize those or resell them but

174
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,919
that is changing we'll look at some

175
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,600
numbers that prove that as well and as

176
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
much as this is going to remain a very

177
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,840
important part of the criminal ecosystem

178
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,520
because credential stuffing tools are

179
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,919
really low bar low barrier to entry um

180
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,440
there are basically no code automation

181
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,880
platforms you don't have to you know

182
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,960
understand any code to write

183
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,360
the the attacks that are being used

184
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,440
they're still not as effective and not

185
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,120
nearly as

186
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,000
workable and cheap as bot shops are um

187
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,160
so what's changing right

188
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,000
instead of databases now it's steeler

189
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,120
malware

190
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,880
and what you're getting is so much more

191
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,479
effective and so much more interesting

192
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,400
than just a simple username password

193
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,840
combo and this is coming from the

194
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,199
protections that you know banks and

195
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,840
other organizations have put in place to

196
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,680
um prevent these sort of attacks right

197
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,520
now we have stuff like two-factor

198
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,199
authentication that triggers if you're

199
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,720
coming from an ip address in a different

200
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,319
area something that's going to check

201
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,240
your cookies or your browser history or

202
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,600
you know all these different sort of

203
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,319
fingerprint um data points even down to

204
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,479
biometrics in the way a mouse moves and

205
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,960
all of this can be emulated through the

206
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,560
information that you get from steeler

207
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,479
malware by putting it into anti-detect

208
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,520
browsers

209
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,840
so rather than buying username and a

210
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,720
password you buy a log or a bot as

211
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,560
they're known interchangeably and you

212
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,479
get everything about a victim's computer

213
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,560
from you know again the exact points we

214
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
were talking about and you can load that

215
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,319
up into an anti-detect browser and

216
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,639
become that victim so if for example

217
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,720
your bank as my bank does and many banks

218
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,520
do only allows two-factor authentication

219
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,960
if you're coming from

220
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,880
say an ip address in a different

221
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,520
location and a different browser if you

222
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,000
have a victim's logs you're emulating

223
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,080
that victim's device um all of their

224
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,680
hardware information even down to their

225
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,319
screen size and you put in a socks proxy

226
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,680
often that's coming from botnets you

227
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,800
know some of the things that we've been

228
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,120
hearing about earlier today um and you

229
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,800
can come out of it you know an ip that's

230
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,400
you know within just a few miles of that

231
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,720
victim so then you are bypassing

232
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
two-factor authentication and other

233
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,080
browser protocols put in place that

234
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,639
would be triggered by a brute forcer um

235
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,160
and i'm happy to delve a little bit more

236
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,440
into that but i want to move on from

237
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,880
that sort of basic

238
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,039
explanation the key takeaway though is

239
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,880
an email and a password is not often

240
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,639
enough to get into

241
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,680
um a system anymore so now that's why

242
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,080
we're seeing i think the really rapid

243
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,879
evolution of steeler malware

244
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,960
um and i promised some stats to prove

245
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,520
this point right so this is 38 account

246
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,680
shops that's the orange lines um or the

247
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,280
orange line sorry

248
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,240
and five major bot shops over the last

249
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,879
three years um and you can see uh right

250
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,919
it's

251
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,759
not that steel or malware in the numbers

252
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,240
has replaced the volume of listings

253
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,800
on account shops as a whole but they are

254
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
certainly trending toward

255
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
replacement in that area right i mean

256
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,240
you can see you know part of this has

257
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,400
been somewhat affected by like slip pp

258
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,080
went down that was a major um account

259
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,160
shop and several others but removing any

260
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,520
one or even a couple of those account

261
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,879
shops that have gone offline in that

262
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,639
time period does not affect the overall

263
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,960
trend um because it's again it's just

264
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,520
not as profitable anymore to resell

265
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,880
these individual accounts when you can

266
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,799
get so much more from a log so i think

267
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,039
we are starting to see um steeler

268
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,880
malware and specifically the bot shops

269
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,039
replacing the traditional account shops

270
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,039
black pass another one and several

271
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,959
others

272
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,880
um so how does it work right when i say

273
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,640
replacing where are these things going

274
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,880
so essentially it boils down to three

275
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,279
different areas that steeler malware is

276
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,880
sold um

277
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,399
either it's used by the malware

278
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,040
developers itself or themselves so

279
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,640
not really sold rather right as i was

280
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,240
talking about earlier you rent it you

281
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,000
distribute it and you use it so that's

282
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,440
the first thing and that corresponds to

283
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,880
that third bullet point there malware

284
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,120
developers they just use it themselves

285
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,560
and then the other two ways are bot

286
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,240
shops this stuff like genesis russian

287
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,760
market you know what we were talking

288
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,279
about where you purchase it you purchase

289
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,959
an individual machine

290
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,200
um or cloud providers which i think are

291
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,800
largely overlooked now but becoming a

292
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,440
larger and larger trend where threat

293
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,399
actors will sell bulk access to say a

294
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,399
red line stealer right a threat actor or

295
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,680
a group of threat actors is running

296
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,519
redline and they'll say okay for a

297
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,720
thousand dollars a month they're not

298
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,640
cheap um a thousand even would be

299
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,640
relatively cheap for some of them you'll

300
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,200
gain access to a historical pool of one

301
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,920
million infected devices and you'll get

302
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,040
a new um say 2 000 or 3 000 every week

303
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,440
or every month um the caveat is you have

304
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,519
to share that with the threat actor but

305
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,240
right this is another reason that uh

306
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,279
malware is replacing um credentials

307
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,040
um you get all of the victims

308
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,560
credentials when you get malware right

309
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,320
so if i go to an account shop and i buy

310
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,160
say a facebook account that's all i get

311
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,519
but if i get steelermail malware i get

312
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,800
the facebook account i get the bank

313
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,440
account i get everything down 30 40

314
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,800
different logins that are saved in that

315
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,360
browser so if i sell that as a malware

316
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,640
cloud

317
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,480
one person can use it for social media

318
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,760
another person can use it for the bank

319
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
another person can use it for crypto um

320
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,200
so that's what makes it profitable the

321
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,279
same victim can be used again and again

322
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,959
and again and again just to reiterate

323
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,360
that point i made earlier um you know

324
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,040
the reason these are that malware is

325
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,240
replacing

326
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,160
uh credential steelers is because of the

327
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,839
volume of information you get and the

328
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,600
security protocols that it allows you to

329
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,360
bypass

330
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,680
um so bot shops right there are

331
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,920
essentially three right now um i have

332
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,040
four because when we made this

333
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,640
presentation and a lot of our data came

334
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,800
from it amigos market was still online

335
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
um that went offline gosh it would have

336
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,200
been a couple months ago at this point

337
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
relatively recent development but now

338
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,160
there are three

339
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,240
it changes relatively rapidly but today

340
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,160
it's genesis which is

341
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,760
effectively the oldest and certainly the

342
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,120
most complex

343
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,480
russian market which has the highest

344
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,760
volumes right now and is probably the

345
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,040
most well-known um amigos which is of

346
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,320
course offline but we'll talk about

347
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,800
later and too easy which is a new

348
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,040
addition to malware they've always done

349
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
other um they've engaged in different

350
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,360
kinds of fraud but they are relatively

351
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,279
new to the malware scene

352
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,640
um and then you have smaller players

353
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,240
like ross logs which has been around for

354
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,320
years at this point um they run and

355
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,920
distribute their own malware so they're

356
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
a smaller operation but still effective

357
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,200
uh mouse inbox which uh was

358
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,120
um again one of the earlier malware

359
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,800
systems that's also gone offline now but

360
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,399
i think it was one that security

361
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,680
professionals certainly liked because

362
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,760
they exposed the full ip of victims so

363
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,000
it made mitigation very easy uh prior to

364
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,240
purchase um and then other smaller

365
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,399
players like topcc world this list isn't

366
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,320
exhausted by any means it's just a

367
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
couple of the shops that we are tracking

368
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,440
right now

369
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:49,680
um

370
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,959
[Music]

371
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,959
so that's shops these are cloud

372
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,120
providers cloud providers really fast

373
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,040
turnaround they don't last all that long

374
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,800
um right i mean you look at how

375
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,399
marketplaces you know there's usually an

376
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,839
exit scam at some point same kind of

377
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,680
thing with cloud providers you can get

378
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,760
malware um very reliably for several

379
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,880
months and then all of a sudden they

380
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,480
disappear maybe because they stopped

381
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,920
distributing the malware or they lost

382
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,839
access to their you know c2 server or

383
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,839
they just didn't want to continue um so

384
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,519
much so that every single one of these

385
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,600
pictures comes from a malware cloud

386
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
provider that is no longer online with

387
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,120
the exception of roscloud which is tied

388
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,639
to ros logs

389
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,320
but numerous cloud providers right they

390
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,760
come up they come down they're largely

391
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,720
on vhf um you'll see plenty of them

392
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,320
there's probably a lot of overlap

393
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,519
between them just because of the volume

394
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,839
they're operating um but again this

395
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,279
might last for a year it might last for

396
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,279
a week um it might be repackaged but

397
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,800
these are the bulk sort of ways that you

398
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,680
can access these things

399
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,120
and then finally as i talked about

400
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,800
earlier malware distributors right

401
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,720
people who just use it themselves um so

402
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,160
we'll talk just briefly about what it

403
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,399
looks like to buy and rent malware right

404
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,240
you go to xss or exploit or again

405
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,800
several other forums um you have a few

406
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,920
options to choose from you have to

407
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,279
decide you know do i want to set up a

408
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,920
panel myself um do i want to host it

409
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,200
do i just want to use another threat

410
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,399
actors panel if i really don't

411
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,680
understand what i'm doing do i want them

412
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,839
to set it up for me will i pay extra

413
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,600
extra money for that um and i can just

414
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,120
get logs received right to my telegram

415
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,360
account on my phone um you know which a

416
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,279
lot of thread actors do it depends how

417
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,720
conscious you are in opsec and you know

418
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,160
where you are where you're located in

419
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,519
the world um

420
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,800
how concerned you are that someone's

421
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,480
going to kind of come after you

422
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,839
but it's essentially it's a free market

423
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,519
ecosystem where people are competing and

424
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,040
they're always adding new updates new

425
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,120
functionality new customer service a

426
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,720
raccoon steeler while it was online had

427
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,120
24-hour customer service spread across

428
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,880
accounts in different time zones so that

429
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,000
you could always get the support you

430
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,760
need

431
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,959
you know different things to try and

432
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,040
grab customers from each other

433
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,440
again right depending on how you want to

434
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,680
host things on panels but you find

435
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,279
something you like on these forums you

436
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,519
reach out usually over telegram can be

437
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,760
jabber or other encrypted messengers um

438
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
and then you'll pay it'll be something

439
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,720
like maybe 30 a month to rent a panel um

440
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,240
all the way up to you know maybe a

441
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,440
couple hundred depending on what you're

442
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,000
getting um but then you might also get

443
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
access to a closed chat so like one of

444
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,440
the steelers that we've gained access to

445
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,199
we've seen within closed communications

446
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,720
they will trade the logs with each other

447
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,040
right i'm you know very interested in

448
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,720
these logs but i don't want these so

449
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,399
i'll trade all of the ones that i've

450
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,920
acquired for all of the ones that you've

451
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
acquired for different domains um so we

452
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,079
are seeing a lot of steeler reuse

453
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,000
and to provide some context this is the

454
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,040
panel for bloody steeler

455
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
i just find sometimes dark web art is

456
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,199
the most among the most interesting but

457
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,360
to also highlight the the weird nature

458
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,199
of the people that we're dealing with uh

459
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,440
bloody steel are shut down um

460
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,639
at this point probably almost a year ago

461
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,839
it's been a while

462
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,160
um but the last message they left for

463
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,199
those of you can read russian

464
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,320
essentially they said that um and later

465
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,360
i turned it turned out i think this

466
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,519
person was about 17 years old but their

467
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,040
mom had got them studying until three in

468
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,480
the morning um and had finally gotten

469
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,320
fed up and taken their computer away so

470
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,000
the malware had the shutdown

471
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
um but it's just interesting to remember

472
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,199
that we are dealing with real people

473
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,120
sometimes and the the concerns that come

474
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,760
in

475
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,839
with that

476
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,160
so monetization though right so we know

477
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,680
why this is happening we know why it's

478
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,920
starting to replace these things but how

479
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,440
do threateners cash these out and it's

480
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,040
not always so simple as well they go

481
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,560
they log into the bank account and they

482
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,000
drain the bank account i mean that is a

483
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,399
lot of it um but this is again why i was

484
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,920
talking about the ingenuity that comes

485
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,839
behind some of this malware um and the

486
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,519
ways the threat actors can cash things

487
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,240
out

488
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,279
um one of the ways or one of the reasons

489
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,399
that malware offers so many different

490
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,480
opportunities to threat actors is the

491
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,160
fact that it is persistent so this

492
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,480
screenshot on the far for you it will be

493
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,120
yes the right same as for me um this is

494
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,560
from genesis this is from one of their

495
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,959
updates those uh red arrows and that

496
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,720
updated those are their markings not

497
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,440
mine um and what they show is if you buy

498
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,759
a bot from a victim computer

499
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,360
the malware doesn't disappear from that

500
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,199
computer right so

501
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,120
maybe a month maybe a day later i get an

502
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,440
update hey this person has changed the

503
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,199
password on their bank account or hey

504
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,639
this person opened a cryptocurrency

505
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,079
account here are their credentials you

506
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,000
can use them to log in so it's not

507
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,399
enough just that i've purchased and have

508
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,759
started to drain the accounts of this

509
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,519
victim i can use this victim on a

510
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,519
recurring basis you know maybe i've

511
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,759
drained their bank account um

512
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,639
they

513
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,000
very frustrated they set up an account

514
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,440
with the new bank they transfer you know

515
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,480
whatever money they have their new

516
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,720
paycheck comes in drain it right again

517
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,320
the victim doesn't have any indication

518
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,000
that anything is wrong unless they

519
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,279
understand that they've been infected

520
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,399
with malware and need to make some

521
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,320
changes and unfortunately because of the

522
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,759
nature of malware and that it's

523
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,759
distributed across um users who aren't

524
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,480
so tech savvy this is a problem right um

525
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,759
and it just opens up those new

526
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,759
opportunities

527
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,759
um how is it monetized right other than

528
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,360
bank accounts credit cards of course the

529
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,279
steelers often will specifically grab

530
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,639
credit cards that are stored in the

531
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,800
browser um

532
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,639
social media which we'll talk about

533
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,160
cryptocurrency which we'll talk about in

534
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,480
depth as well and unauthorized access of

535
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,199
course right buzzword ransomware um of

536
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,399
course this is you know one of the

537
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,320
threat vectors that can be important in

538
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,920
ransomware and with corporate access

539
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,800
because

540
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,120
as we'll see you can really um narrow

541
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,880
down what sort of victim you're looking

542
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,119
for

543
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,319
um so

544
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,959
first looking at caching out right so

545
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,839
russian market um and i think amigos was

546
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,799
this way as well um and i believe also

547
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,000
too easy

548
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
uh cryptocurrency it's so easy to cash

549
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,039
out they're not even going to give you

550
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,280
the opportunity um russian market logs

551
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,959
and the other bot shops are pretty cheap

552
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,559
um they're usually between ten and three

553
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,400
dollars and the reason for that is the

554
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,000
best resources have been cashed out

555
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,440
already so you'll often see the

556
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,640
cryptocurrency accounts have already

557
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
been drained however genesis which does

558
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,120
command a premium premium on price does

559
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,039
not do that by and large

560
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,760
um so that orange line down there that's

561
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,840
much higher than that purple line that

562
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,960
is the average price per week over time

563
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,520
since um december of 2021 oh no sorry

564
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,280
i've yeah i'm looking at that backwards

565
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,200
sorry since 2020 to 2021 um and the

566
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,799
higher orange line that shows prices

567
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,360
hovering between 60 and 100 that is the

568
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,120
price of logs that had common

569
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,360
cryptocurrency wallet domains included

570
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,440
in them um

571
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,840
so logs that can be assumed to contain

572
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,080
some sort of cryptocurrency resource um

573
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,840
and then the purple line is all other

574
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,080
listings over the same time so obviously

575
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
this is a major point for threat actors

576
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,640
cryptocurrency is very much in demand um

577
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,320
and it's you know again it's just a very

578
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,320
easy simple way to start cashing out

579
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,160
these resources

580
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,679
you'll see similar trends with logs that

581
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,600
contain paypal aliexpress different

582
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,919
things but in by and large the easier it

583
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,200
is to cash out a resource the more

584
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,520
expensive that bot is going to be on

585
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,039
bots that don't already cash it out

586
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,679
before they offer it to you

587
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,280
number two social media and i think this

588
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,120
is among the most interesting um what

589
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,720
you see at the bottom that's the panel

590
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,640
from snowflake steeler and then what you

591
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,679
see in the right is dolphin tool

592
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,360
i don't know how familiar everyone is

593
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,200
with social media fraud but i'll just

594
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,320
delve into it a little bit

595
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,400
essentially social media accounts are

596
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,000
almost as valuable if not more so than

597
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,760
bank accounts because you can make more

598
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,240
money with them um

599
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
dolphin which is this tool on the right

600
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,640
similar to other tools like uh there are

601
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,520
several others socrobotic fb tool

602
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,120
basically tools that allow you to

603
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,720
manipulate hundreds or thousands of

604
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,039
social media accounts via the api to run

605
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,640
advertising campaigns

606
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,120
now um these social media companies are

607
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,440
obviously very good and in some ways

608
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,960
very effective especially on the browser

609
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,760
level at blocking these sorts of

610
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,679
advertising campaigns but if you have a

611
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,679
steady stream of 2000 new logs coming in

612
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,120
in a week and they're coming in with

613
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,559
credit cards that you can use to launch

614
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,400
those advertising campaigns that's a

615
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,160
really good source of revenue right and

616
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,679
then when you combine that with cloaking

617
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,160
tools um which allow you to advertise

618
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
things like gambling or drugs or other

619
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,080
illegal activity on social media

620
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,480
platforms that ban that sort of activity

621
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,480
now you have the targeted power of

622
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,640
social media that allows you to get a

623
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,840
database of say users that are likely to

624
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,960
be at risk of gambling run targeted ads

625
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,480
to them that advertise gambling

626
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,640
platforms on a pay-per-click basis use a

627
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,480
victim's credit card to pay for it and

628
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,159
reap all the profits from that and we've

629
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,880
seen just really incredible returns on

630
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,799
investment from that

631
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,200
because this isn't technically

632
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,960
legal depending on what you're doing

633
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,320
there are some shadow ecosystems

634
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,400
especially in eastern europe where you

635
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,080
know they have physical offices they're

636
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,320
running really complex business software

637
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,799
um and you can see returns of thousands

638
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,159
or even hundreds of thousand dollars a

639
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,000
month doing this sort of thing it's very

640
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,880
much driving the malware ecosystem in

641
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,280
this way

642
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,720
and then finally of course on our

643
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,880
authorized access this is the search

644
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,559
panel from russian market on the top and

645
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,400
from genesis on the bottom

646
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,760
you can search by whatever you want so

647
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,280
let's say you are a ransomware provider

648
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,120
and you're interested in say corporate

649
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,440
access search for subdomains with slack

650
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,000
with citrix sso octa right anything

651
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,360
that's going to gain you access to a

652
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,120
corporate domain and if that corporate

653
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,360
domain doesn't have say a bank account

654
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,039
on it might be really cheap might be

655
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,919
three or four dollars

656
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,600
so you can get something really valuable

657
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,360
here for really cheap especially if you

658
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,840
can get in and then move laterally or

659
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,240
extend that access and then sell that to

660
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,000
a ransomware provider for three or four

661
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,679
times the profit

662
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,080
um genesis market has been has been

663
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,840
reported as the initial vector in the ea

664
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,400
games leech for games leak for slack

665
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,760
access

666
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,200
so you know certainly a very real threat

667
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,360
but yeah this is again obviously another

668
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,600
way to monetize these sorts of logs

669
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,720
um so that's a little bit about

670
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,320
monetization and then finally before i

671
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,679
turn things over to austin i'll talk

672
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,760
about the trends we're seeing on the

673
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,120
macro level

674
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,000
um so large chart that's genesis and

675
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,679
then the small charts that is russian

676
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,240
market and amigos um russian market and

677
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,000
amigos almost identical and again we'll

678
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
talk a little bit more about why um but

679
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,280
one thing that is interesting in these

680
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,960
bot shops is that

681
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,559
all of the bot shops we looked at and

682
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,720
too easy has um statistics i couldn't

683
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,880
figure or i couldn't fit it on the slide

684
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,559
without making it what i assumed to be

685
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,159
unreadable in fact it might already be

686
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,799
unreadable so i apologize for that um

687
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,400
but too easy is very much in line with

688
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,880
russian market and amigos and what

689
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,760
you're seeing is the highest volume is

690
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,320
orange and the lowest volume is black

691
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,559
pink is sort of in the middle

692
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,159
and what you're seeing is that

693
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,280
the countries with the highest

694
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,280
population have the highest infected

695
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,520
victims no surprise there um but again

696
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,159
genesis um when we look at that again a

697
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,600
premium market sort of the opposite

698
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,480
trend the top 10 impacted countries on

699
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,960
genesis market are all either european

700
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,520
union or the united states um italy

701
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,440
france both feature especially high on

702
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,919
genesis so again the threat actors are

703
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,200
commanding a higher price and they're

704
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
offering a premium in that

705
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,960
a user from the european union is likely

706
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,080
to have a bank account in there with

707
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,600
more um

708
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,880
you know with a higher amount than a

709
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,640
user from say a higher population

710
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,580
country like india um

711
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,159
[Music]

712
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,760
and then looking at price right i've

713
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,120
talked a little bit or i've talked

714
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,720
consistently about genesis being higher

715
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,120
in price genesis is that black line that

716
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
starts up on the top um we have seen

717
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,600
some sort of um you know coming together

718
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,360
of the lines and as they sort of compete

719
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,960
with one another the reason the pink

720
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,919
line stops which is amigos is amigos

721
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,919
going offline and you can also see the

722
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,080
historic average price in there but

723
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,760
again what you pay for is what you get

724
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,440
too easy is considerably cheaper and

725
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,480
you're also getting the least

726
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,919
information when you buy the log you

727
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,000
don't know what the steeler is um you

728
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,600
don't necessarily know how reliable it

729
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,640
is there's not very good customer

730
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,000
service in fact you're lucky if you can

731
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,360
get the site to resolve at all on your

732
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,159
first try um so because of that you're

733
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,080
paying three or four dollars a log um

734
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,440
you want something much more complex

735
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,120
like genesis which comes with a built-in

736
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,960
anti-detect browser you're willing to

737
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
pay a premium for it um so again it

738
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,559
depends on what you want and it also

739
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,640
depends on how sophisticated a threat

740
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
actor you are because with that built-in

741
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,400
anti-detect browser from genesis if you

742
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,480
know how to purchase a socks proxy you

743
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,320
can effectively use an anti-detect

744
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,159
browser because it's all built into the

745
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,400
store

746
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,440
um steeler type and volume this is from

747
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,640
january 2021 to april 2022

748
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,840
redline has really been dominant

749
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,520
and we'll talk a little bit more about

750
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,440
why perhaps in the um as we go on uh

751
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,039
amigos here really accounting for the

752
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,960
largest number of shops that number is a

753
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,240
little misleading and again i'll talk

754
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,559
why on the next slide but

755
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,640
um i do think it's interesting um and i

756
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,080
should note that this breakdown of

757
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,919
redline vidar raccoon all the different

758
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,559
scalar types comes exclusively from

759
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,159
russian market and amigos because they

760
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,600
are the only ones that give a steeler

761
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,520
type in the listing um but i do think

762
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,039
these sort of things can be interesting

763
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,720
especially when we look over time for

764
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,200
resource allocation if you understand

765
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,880
where the steelers are coming from or

766
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,200
which ones are being sold the most often

767
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,559
which ones are being the most rapidly

768
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,720
developed right um which ones present

769
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,880
the greatest threat to your organization

770
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,320
then you can look at that steeler you

771
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,600
can look at how it's developing and you

772
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,120
can try and put mitigation in place

773
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,960
um and then finally overlap which was

774
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,240
another interesting trend that we looked

775
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,320
at now when we first started doing this

776
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,559
research um this wasn't public knowledge

777
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,320
that russian market and amigos were

778
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,520
reselling the same logs um now it's been

779
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,440
sort of more or less widely reported and

780
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,880
again with amigos going offline it's

781
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,440
less impactful but you can see using the

782
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,400
init original infection date of the log

783
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,000
as a proxy

784
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,760
those two pink lines at the top moving

785
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,240
together on a basic one to one ratio um

786
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,000
for a while every log on amigos and

787
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,760
russian market coming out was the same

788
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,960
and there was some back end

789
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,400
collaboration because we ran some tests

790
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,919
where if you purchase a log on one it

791
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,919
disappears from the other and vice versa

792
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,240
um and this was once that was publicly

793
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,159
reported um

794
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,400
then shortly after that amigos went down

795
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,000
i'm not sure if that's related i don't

796
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,279
have that information to say but i do

797
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,200
think it was interesting that it seemed

798
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,480
as though they were trying to make as

799
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,919
much money as they could from amigos

800
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,440
before things

801
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,039
before eventually just sort of exiting

802
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,559
um i think about a month before amigos

803
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,799
went offline they started charging a 350

804
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,000
application fee it used to be free um

805
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
but again interesting right um and you

806
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,440
can see sort of the overlap between

807
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
shops russian market and genesis we're

808
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,919
looking at around one percent 1.5 for

809
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,000
amigos and genesis these are probably

810
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,679
victims that were infected by different

811
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,360
threat actors and just happen to be

812
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,480
extremely unlucky and get their

813
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,720
information on both shops and in fact

814
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
you will see this right like russian

815
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,360
market has um numerous sellers that they

816
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,440
resell on behalf of um and you'll see

817
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,760
the same victim ip up there infected by

818
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,919
vadar redline and raccoon

819
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,000
people with extremely poor online habits

820
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,840
um who've been infected and resold

821
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,400
numerous times but again then that 46

822
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,000
percent overlap between russian market

823
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,720
and amigos um indicating right and that

824
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,640
partially explains why the numbers were

825
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,480
so large earlier for russian market and

826
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,080
amigos um just indicating um obviously a

827
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,600
lot of overlap and collaboration there

828
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
and then finally that is all it from my

829
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,080
end so i'll turn it over to austin to

830
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,440
talk about how these steelers have

831
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,520
evolved over time and the sort of

832
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
tactics and trends that we're seeing and

833
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,960
then also a little bit about how we can

834
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,960
use that data in defense so thanks very

835
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,200
much

836
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,039
all right so let's talk about the

837
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,720
evolution of a lot of the tools that

838
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,799
threat actors are using

839
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,480
so the way in which directors have been

840
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,799
committing fraud has continually updated

841
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,600
as well as their tool sets so

842
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,240
the the combinations of tools that these

843
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,279
products use widely range based on what

844
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,399
they're targeting and how they're

845
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,240
targeting it right used to be that they

846
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,840
could just use the brute forcers but now

847
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,919
they're having to use these combinations

848
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,480
of anti-detect browsers proxies and

849
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,440
various cash out techniques and you know

850
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,760
techniques that target directly

851
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,000
individual marketplaces as you kind of

852
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,120
see when you go through a lot of these

853
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,520
markets uh in forums is that methods are

854
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,279
at times very targeted the method you

855
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,880
may use to

856
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,240
empty one crypto wallet through a

857
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,640
platform may widely vary and differ from

858
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,559
another market

859
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,960
and the threat actors creating the tools

860
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,799
used by the threat actors committing the

861
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,360
fraud have also continued to adapt

862
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,880
as we'll see in like genesis

863
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,200
browser and tool sets

864
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,000
they have continually added new

865
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,480
data points that the systems are capable

866
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,640
of emulating they add these new data

867
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,240
sets they add these new data points

868
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,760
where again we just had the original

869
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,159
username and password we're now going to

870
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,000
look at things such as username password

871
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,080
the amount of ram battery left the fonts

872
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,159
downloaded the graphic card all of these

873
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,600
different data points are become

874
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,440
incredibly important and have to be

875
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,960
developed from

876
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,480
the thread actor standpoint when

877
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,760
developing these browsers and these

878
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
anti-detect tools similarly they need

879
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,919
malware that can provide them it's of no

880
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,320
use to a threat actor to develop a

881
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,240
graphics card emulation component but

882
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
not have a malware that can feed it so

883
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,600
many of these

884
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,279
malware developers within kind of the

885
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,520
open uh forums and markets as well as

886
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,960
some of the more private markets have

887
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,559
all made changes to adapt to these

888
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,200
circumstances uh and then again the the

889
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,760
data as brian has talked about uh has

890
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,240
continually to continue to evolve you

891
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,760
should just be you know the username and

892
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,279
passwords but now we're getting to these

893
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,279
points where you are getting these full

894
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,840
digital fingerprints such that

895
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,200
you can become somebody online

896
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,320
so let's talk a little bit about the

897
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,720
anti-detect browsers and what they do

898
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,640
so the original purpose behind an

899
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,640
anti-detect browser was really geared

900
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,440
towards privacy the idea was i could go

901
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,799
through and i could change my user

902
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,960
agents i could change how my system

903
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,520
responded i could change how i looked so

904
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,480
that

905
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,399
various sites trackers that kind of

906
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,760
stuff couldn't follow me around the

907
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,120
internet

908
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,440
and what was really nice about these is

909
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,360
you could create

910
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,320
your own profiles and whatnot to better

911
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,559
blend in and create whatever you wanted

912
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,000
so if you were

913
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,520
trying to appear as if you were coming

914
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,080
from say canada you could set up a

915
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,760
system that looked like it was coming

916
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,440
from canada

917
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,120
threat actors however realize this of

918
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,399
course has a lot of use in their

919
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,080
perspective because

920
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,000
when trying to cash out of a bank of

921
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,080
america account connections coming from

922
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,760
russian systems generally doesn't look

923
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,720
too kosher so we have these systems that

924
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,279
really take part in this genesis is one

925
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,200
of these really great examples in that

926
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,960
they have both their genesis browser and

927
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,559
the genesis plug-in that you can install

928
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,679
in any chromium browser

929
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:10,960
you know while some of these browsers

930
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,480
will operate it's just simple imports

931
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,440
where you load in an xml file genesis is

932
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,640
incredibly powerful in that it will take

933
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,880
a genesis account directly bought on the

934
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,039
market and automatically import it

935
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,559
literally to the point where if you open

936
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,600
the browser and you provide the

937
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,360
necessary authentication information to

938
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,279
access your genesis account you can just

939
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,960
pick the bot you want and then from

940
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,440
there import a proxy and that's it the

941
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,120
technical requirements for performing

942
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,799
these types of configurations has gone

943
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,799
from relatively sophisticated to as

944
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,720
simple as a drag and drop click and play

945
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,799
and looking at the growth of a lot of

946
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,200
the discussion around these

947
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,399
malware

948
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,640
that is that has been targeting these

949
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,559
more advanced features you know these

950
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,320
these digital fingerprints has widely

951
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,600
increased since uh 2016. we can kind of

952
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,919
follow through and this graph shows

953
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,159
discussion and the relative discussion

954
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,080
across the number of forums where these

955
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,000
malware are being discussed so one of

956
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,760
the early ones that was very popular was

957
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,240
uh azeroth and you can see azeroth

958
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,559
maintained at least some presence up

959
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,640
until around 2019

960
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,399
at that point i believe the developer

961
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,080
decided they were going to stop

962
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,200
development there were some

963
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,960
vulnerabilities which impacted the

964
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,279
malware and really kind of hurt a lot of

965
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,080
the

966
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,480
public trust in the malware but you also

967
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,159
see other new families coming up like

968
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,159
vidar which has remained relevant

969
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,559
since its initial introduction

970
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,159
and more recently we can see a lot of

971
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,960
references to the red line in glade

972
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,840
starting in q1 of 2020. redline has

973
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,919
maintained its position within the

974
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,679
steele market as a

975
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,760
high-tier steeler that's both effective

976
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,679
and regularly maintained and updated

977
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,760
because of that you know you have a lot

978
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,600
more mentions of it you have a lot more

979
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,960
public

980
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,679
presence for it

981
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,600
and then looking at the functionality of

982
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,279
these right when i talked about the

983
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,760
genesis plug-in at this point and this

984
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,679
may actually be dated since

985
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,919
since we put it through um it can

986
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,080
generate at least 36 different points

987
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,679
and that goes from everything as simple

988
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,159
as like user agent and cookies but it

989
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,159
also includes things such as unique

990
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,159
fingerprints audio

991
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,559
battery limits the cpu cores fonts

992
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,240
installed all of this information which

993
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,480
a site may use to try to validate an

994
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,960
account this provides threat actors with

995
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,960
the ability to maintain and pretend to

996
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,000
be that and modern steelers now have

997
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,760
begun to provide that necessary

998
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,080
information so you can see on

999
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,840
the right the larger one is an example

1000
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,440
of a raccoon

1001
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,600
steeler log you can see what's actually

1002
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,720
very interesting because you can see the

1003
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,640
exact version that it came out on you

1004
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,919
can see when the malware was ran you

1005
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,760
could see the bot id and looking through

1006
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,279
you can see some basic stats on the

1007
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,480
system

1008
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,159
but also we get an ip we get a location

1009
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,200
we know that

1010
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,320
you know it gives us a latitude and

1011
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,000
longitude it gives us the computer name

1012
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,080
it gives us the username all of this

1013
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,000
information comes through incredibly

1014
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,679
useful when imported into these other

1015
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,120
tools because it gives us everything we

1016
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,799
need to better create

1017
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,240
our victim

1018
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,640
same thing with um looking at the

1019
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,960
smaller image that is a full dump of the

1020
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,279
information that's included you can see

1021
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,519
there's a passwords.log under the google

1022
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,679
chrome browser but there's also a lot of

1023
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,039
other interesting information there's

1024
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,559
the keywords there's a list of the

1025
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,000
downloads there's a list of the cookies

1026
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,919
and there's a list of the autofill data

1027
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,600
all of that information is incredibly

1028
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,120
important because it helps us to better

1029
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,919
mimic a user um and on top of that we

1030
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,240
see other information such as

1031
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,200
logs stolen from steam uh screenshots

1032
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,640
and then like a

1033
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,360
filezilla dump from

1034
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,840
likely some type of ftp again all of

1035
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,760
this information can make it some way

1036
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,679
into any of these platforms and be sold

1037
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,279
and all of that information can help a

1038
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,080
threat actor commit more advanced fraud

1039
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,320
against very targeted organizations and

1040
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,600
targeted

1041
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,519
systems

1042
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,880
another area where we've seen a lot of

1043
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,240
growth and change is kind of the

1044
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,080
distribution

1045
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,360
so there's really a couple different

1046
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,679
ways that threat actors can do this

1047
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,039
very hands-on approach in which the

1048
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,440
threat actors self-distribute this is

1049
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,800
important to remember with groups like

1050
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,879
raccoon and vadar where they provide you

1051
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,199
with the steeler the role of the threat

1052
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,960
actor in that case is just to distribute

1053
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,800
it so in some cases they may have a very

1054
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,639
robust spam network they may have a very

1055
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,320
robust environment where they can spread

1056
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,599
their steeler

1057
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,159
they can do that um on their own they

1058
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,760
can also go around and spread it on

1059
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,280
common sites

1060
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,679
we'll see a lot of malware actually on

1061
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,520
these hacker forms specifically low in

1062
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,960
mid tier forms where somebody will

1063
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,280
create a cracked version of something

1064
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,719
and when they run it it's actually an

1065
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,399
info stealer that will steal all of the

1066
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,000
threat doctor's information it's always

1067
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
ironic when you see a criminal's

1068
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,239
logs in these data dumps

1069
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,320
but there are also other services kind

1070
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,239
of more ideal for these hands-off actors

1071
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,040
so

1072
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,800
install shop

1073
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,399
was is no longer active but it was a

1074
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,359
shop run by a specific thread actor on

1075
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,960
it was exploit

1076
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,200
on exploit so high tier uh forum and

1077
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,520
this shop did nothing but spread your

1078
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,640
malware

1079
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,320
now

1080
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,560
the problem with this of course is

1081
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,760
when they're spreading the malware

1082
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,040
themselves you don't really know where

1083
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,359
it's going to go but from a threat

1084
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,240
actors perspective it does allow you to

1085
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,400
take kind of a hands-off approach right

1086
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,680
especially if you're using something

1087
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,800
raccoon like raccoon or vidar you can

1088
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,760
begin spreading your malware with very

1089
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,520
little effort all you have to do is log

1090
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,200
into your platform of choice take the

1091
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,800
build that they gave you and pass it to

1092
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,760
this

1093
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,440
this distributor who will then

1094
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,040
distribute it and your logs will appear

1095
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,720
on your panel

1096
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,000
um

1097
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,880
the individuals who operate and provide

1098
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,960
this service are limited because it is a

1099
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,560
difficult service to provide but it is

1100
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,079
available there for threat actors who

1101
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,000
don't necessarily want to provide their

1102
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,640
own services and perform their own

1103
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,640
spreading

1104
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,240
so another thing we want to talk about

1105
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,640
is the malware updates and notable

1106
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,280
events that impact this uh given the

1107
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,880
ability for us to track some of the

1108
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,040
malware log numbers on these various

1109
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,480
sites we're curious to see if there was

1110
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,160
any type of

1111
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,480
relationship between the updates and the

1112
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,400
volumes we were observing

1113
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,640
so quick little overview about how uh

1114
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,480
updates are handled

1115
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,880
some maintain active updates within the

1116
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,680
public forums uh that they operate in

1117
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,720
and

1118
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,000
this is going to include things like

1119
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,560
raccoon taurus and redline generally

1120
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,440
these threat actors are going to go into

1121
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,280
mid and high tier forms where they're

1122
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,200
selling their malware and they're going

1123
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,280
to provide regular updates about the

1124
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,040
malware

1125
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,480
information provided in these updates

1126
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,320
vary sometimes it may be as simple as

1127
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,839
small bug fix

1128
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,800
sometimes it may be as in-depth as you

1129
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,200
know bug fixes relating to

1130
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,040
new browsers yada yada yada and it

1131
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,520
provides a lot of in-depth information

1132
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,119
other operators don't necessarily

1133
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,040
provide this publicly so viadar is one

1134
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,760
of those inviter for a very short time

1135
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,920
provided updates on a public forum but

1136
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,760
they then chose to release all of their

1137
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,320
updates via their uh their single

1138
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,560
sign-on platform that they leverage

1139
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,079
faker is another one you can kind of see

1140
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,839
here there's a limited number of logs

1141
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,920
and they provided two updates that

1142
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,079
really didn't

1143
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,079
correlate with any logs

1144
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,079
pros and cons for both approaches to

1145
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,880
providing updates

1146
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,720
when you provide your updates publicly

1147
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,640
it lets threat actors know that you're

1148
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,560
continuing continuing to develop your

1149
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,599
malware and continuing to support new

1150
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,920
changes so if an issue comes up and all

1151
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,040
of a sudden

1152
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,960
av systems are detecting your malware

1153
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,720
because of an operation well i can look

1154
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,240
through your past change logs and i can

1155
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,079
see that you are committed to ensuring

1156
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,000
your malware remains as undetectable as

1157
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,119
possible

1158
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,359
um the downside to that of course is we

1159
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,680
as researchers can follow up on that and

1160
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,520
learn what they're doing right

1161
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,040
if a new

1162
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,119
browser update comes out that mitigates

1163
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,880
various collections we can now track how

1164
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,320
long it takes for threat actors to

1165
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,240
respond to that and we can see

1166
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,160
when that risk will increase

1167
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,839
overall many of the families have taken

1168
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,760
a very public approach though because in

1169
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,520
the long run it does allow them to kind

1170
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,359
of get that advertisement maintain

1171
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,200
activity within the

1172
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,800
forums and show that they are committed

1173
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,400
to their malware

1174
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,640
so let's look at a couple examples and

1175
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,480
there's some really notable ones in

1176
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,400
which various updates and other notable

1177
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,880
events have

1178
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,040
have occurred in times where they

1179
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,960
suggest there may be impact on the log

1180
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,880
numbers so in this case all the blue

1181
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
lines you're going to see are notable

1182
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,040
events or updates

1183
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,599
and the red lines represent some type of

1184
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,280
notable event or update

1185
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,119
now in raccoon uh in may of 2021

1186
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,040
it was exposed by researcher it was

1187
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,800
revealed by researchers that

1188
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,960
raccoon had accidentally exposed its

1189
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,880
back in the last search system which

1190
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,800
allowed researchers to go through and

1191
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,480
see a list of every infected device

1192
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,320
subsequently after that was announced we

1193
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,040
can see a slight decrease

1194
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,960
a significant decrease actually in the

1195
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,720
number of logs we were observing within

1196
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,400
raccoon and you can see it doesn't

1197
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,160
actually get back up to the limits it

1198
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,280
was prior to that breach for nearly four

1199
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,880
months

1200
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,040
and then the final line of course

1201
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,560
as you would expect raccoon has shut

1202
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,040
down its operations due to the ongoing

1203
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,880
issues in ukraine

1204
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,480
and as a result of that shutdown they

1205
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,480
are no longer producing logs

1206
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,520
which

1207
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,560
is to be expected

1208
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,760
another interesting example is vidar so

1209
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,240
vidar as i said doesn't provide updates

1210
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,760
on their

1211
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,119
public forums

1212
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,040
or within a public presence to a great

1213
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,480
degree i think they have three or four

1214
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,520
small updates however they do have a

1215
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,920
single platform where users who are

1216
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,839
subscribed to the

1217
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,280
vidar malware can go log in and can

1218
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,800
collect

1219
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,480
information about vidar and collect

1220
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,040
their stolen credentials

1221
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,359
in this

1222
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,160
vidar does have a very robust change log

1223
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,720
that is incredibly detailed

1224
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,440
and looking through those the red lines

1225
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,240
map

1226
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,040
a number of updates so

1227
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,880
in some of these more

1228
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,800
pressing updates vadar doesn't provide

1229
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,640
much information but what's very

1230
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,280
interesting in nearly every single

1231
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,920
update that had this the phrase urgent

1232
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,480
replacement emergency update something

1233
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,599
of that line

1234
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,560
we saw a very severe drop

1235
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,560
in logs following that

1236
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,920
now when you think about what these

1237
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,040
updates are doing they're likely

1238
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,640
addressing some type of problem in the

1239
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,079
malware in some cases they're related to

1240
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,079
protection bypasses and other cases are

1241
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,560
related to collections so it makes sense

1242
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,400
that after these emergency updates come

1243
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,280
out we would see a slight drop in

1244
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,400
malware

1245
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,760
sorry in the number of logs we're

1246
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,040
receiving because generally there's

1247
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,960
going to be a lot a slight lag in

1248
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,000
between these updates coming out in the

1249
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,599
logs they're collecting

1250
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,480
so in every one of these cases we saw

1251
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,640
a significant drop the only case where

1252
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,440
we saw an actual significant rise was in

1253
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,760
update 40.2

1254
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
vidar implemented some new protection

1255
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,599
bypasses and

1256
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,359
less than a month after that came out we

1257
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,680
can see in the

1258
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,599
last line on the right we can see the

1259
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,319
blog numbers significantly increase

1260
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,400
after that and then they drop following

1261
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,240
that but uh

1262
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,319
you know there there is potential value

1263
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,839
in these updates

1264
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,599
uh last but not least we want to talk

1265
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,440
about vadar i mentioned before viadar is

1266
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,200
becoming incredibly popular and it's

1267
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,800
used highly among the threat actor

1268
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,280
community from low medium and high tier

1269
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,200
threat actors

1270
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,640
now

1271
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,319
redline does leverage a centralized

1272
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:43,280
panel to a degree and they also give

1273
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,280
users panels that they can set up

1274
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,560
themselves and in a number of updates uh

1275
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,040
redline the redline developer glade made

1276
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,800
changes that

1277
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,040
ultimately changed how the client the

1278
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,640
malware itself would communicate with

1279
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,960
the server or the panel

1280
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,040
and in those changes it required a

1281
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,599
complete reworking of both the malware

1282
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,319
and the panel such that they needed new

1283
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,319
panels entirely old malware wouldn't

1284
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,280
work

1285
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,520
and when those occurred we can see

1286
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,079
significant and notable drops in many of

1287
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,839
these situations

1288
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,560
so in update 18.1

1289
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,920
they come out and they say the old

1290
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,520
builds on the new panel will not work

1291
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,280
new builds on the old panel won't work

1292
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,560
and actually

1293
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,319
break it to a point where it's

1294
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,319
inoperable new builds will only work

1295
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:29,440
with a new panel and we see a

1296
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,599
significant drop after that similar for

1297
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,079
update 20.2 we see another drop update

1298
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,480
21 we see kind of hits at the bottom and

1299
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,520
then goes back up in update 21.3 we see

1300
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,960
a drop shortly thereafter

1301
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,680
when we consider what this means from a

1302
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,040
threat actor's perspective it makes

1303
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,319
sense that we

1304
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,640
see significant drops right

1305
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,079
in order for threat actors to go and

1306
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,520
rebuild their panels they have to go out

1307
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,960
they have to obtain new infrastructure

1308
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,440
they have to redistribute their malware

1309
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,640
and especially in like the update 18.1

1310
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,359
where these updates old builds would

1311
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,160
actually cause damage to the panels

1312
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,760
they essentially have to go through and

1313
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,920
completely restart their operations to

1314
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,960
ensure

1315
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,480
that the malware

1316
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,560
that they're running is going to match

1317
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,720
the proper panel in place and at any

1318
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,400
point setting up the servers anybody

1319
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,319
here knows setting up a new server and

1320
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:23,839
making those quick patches is always a

1321
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,599
rather stressful time and it rarely if

1322
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,000
ever goes well the first time

1323
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,800
so these types of disruptions do have

1324
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,560
do appear to have potential impact on

1325
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,720
the number of logs that we're observing

1326
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,680
um

1327
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,240
that being said redline is an incredibly

1328
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,720
effective steeler so many threat actors

1329
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,640
are willing to kind of look past some of

1330
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,960
those issues

1331
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,359
so i want to wrap things up now

1332
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,720
what can we really do to help prevent

1333
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,160
these attacks

1334
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,079
and help mitigate the risk of bot shops

1335
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,720
and information stealers so targeted bot

1336
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,640
shot monitoring and calculated buys can

1337
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,760
help identify internal exposure

1338
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,760
and identify high value compromises

1339
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,200
right

1340
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,599
there's a lot of organizations who will

1341
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,280
leverage their intel providers to look

1342
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,520
through these or these different

1343
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,280
marketplaces and whatnot for potential

1344
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,520
references of inside leaks

1345
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,839
because those inside leaks have high

1346
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,720
value for damage

1347
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,880
so following that uh given that a lot of

1348
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,400
the steeler logs and the information

1349
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,599
coming from those logs are going to

1350
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,200
anti-detect browsers and are going to

1351
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,680
help commit fraud tracking the changes

1352
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,200
that these malware make is incredibly

1353
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,560
important because it helps us to go

1354
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,040
through and better adapt the detection

1355
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,040
methods that we're using um and finally

1356
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,800
understanding how these shops are

1357
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,200
growing and understanding what is

1358
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,839
happening to the malware and what um

1359
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,160
what malware are popular can better help

1360
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,880
inform resource allocation you know just

1361
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,560
understanding the simple fact that it

1362
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,720
you know last month raccoon steel went

1363
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,480
down it's probably a really good time to

1364
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,240
start deallocating resources from

1365
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,839
raccoon detection and pushing them

1366
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,839
towards redline vidar and other

1367
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:05,440
detections so with that i'd like to say

1368
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,599
thank you thank you to everyone here

1369
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,880
thank you to botkov and if you have any

1370
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,720
questions we're happy to take some now

1371
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,960
and if we don't get to it of course feel

1372
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,040
free to reach out to us via the emails

1373
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,330
thank you

1374
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:26,240
[Applause]

1375
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:31,799
okay we have time for a couple questions

1376
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,000
come on guys

1377
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,200
italy of course yeah

1378
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,880
thanks thanks for that oh guys um

1379
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,240
i have a question uh from your

1380
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,040
perspective uh are criminal escrow

1381
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,200
services still part of the

1382
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,440
underground economy like and how big is

1383
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,839
this what do you see

1384
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,319
um escrow services vary greatly to

1385
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:01,760
greatly from thread act of the threat

1386
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,000
actor

1387
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,720
most threat actors will most legitimate

1388
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,880
threat actors have no issue using them

1389
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,680
um a lot of the steeler

1390
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,760
a lot within the steeler industry

1391
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,920
specifically like the malware itself

1392
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,520
is cheap enough that many people won't

1393
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,119
consider using it

1394
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,599
that being said on the automated shots

1395
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,880
that we discussed genesis russian market

1396
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,920
and the the remaining ones

1397
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,680
an escrow service isn't used there but

1398
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,040
they do have

1399
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,440
generally very good customer support in

1400
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,160
place so that if there is an issue

1401
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,000
usually you can reach out to the the

1402
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,520
site operators and be like hey i bought

1403
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,280
this log they were all dead none of them

1404
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,560
worked and nine out of 10 times those

1405
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,480
those administrators will work with you

1406
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,800
to either get you some money back or try

1407
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,480
to help you configure your tools so that

1408
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,040
they will work um certainly though when

1409
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,960
operating in

1410
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,800
kind of the the peer-to-peer aspect that

1411
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,319
happens on many forms and in chat

1412
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,480
services escrows are still regularly

1413
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,800
used

1414
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,760
and just to add one flavor to that um

1415
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,280
automated escrows are starting to become

1416
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,359
more common too so like xss just opened

1417
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,240
up an automated or after garand right so

1418
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,920
it removes the middleman entirely and

1419
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,640
has the site handle the escrow for you

1420
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,560
um and partially right i mean when we're

1421
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,079
talking about the cloud services where

1422
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,079
you might be paying one two or three

1423
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,000
thousand dollars a month um in that case

1424
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,160
escrow services are used regularly and

1425
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,839
um by any reputable threat actor

1426
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,800
so what's your opinion on this entire

1427
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,839
iit industry moving toward a more user

1428
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,240
privacy protecting scheme for example

1429
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,760
like apple is

1430
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,760
rolling out a private relay to anonymize

1431
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,800
iep the user agent is becoming truncated

1432
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,839
to only a few bytes of information

1433
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,119
and so on and so forth pretty much all

1434
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,559
the fingerprints will generate out of

1435
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,480
the browser you'll be severely limited

1436
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,880
to a few bits eventually so it will be

1437
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,800
an ideal world for all these malware

1438
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,800
stealers right you don't have any need

1439
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,160
any certificate

1440
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,000
to emulate the real user right

1441
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,119
i think uh given enough time these star

1442
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,480
doctors have proved that they're contin

1443
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,480
they can continually adapt and always

1444
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,800
move two away such that they can

1445
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,440
continue to commit this fraud um

1446
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,680
what we will see i i believe is you know

1447
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,559
the

1448
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,559
a slight kind of decrease in some of

1449
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,800
that and how successful fraud can be as

1450
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,559
uh things become more anonymized and

1451
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:31,680
privatized um you know that addition of

1452
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,920
privacy is is

1453
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,160
a good thing in some ways but also a bad

1454
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,839
thing in others

1455
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,079
a lot of fraud detection systems now do

1456
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,000
rely on the ability to correlate

1457
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,119
information

1458
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,960
so i think there are many

1459
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,960
i think what we'll see is kind of a move

1460
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,359
in what information is correlated so

1461
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,440
maybe we can't use an ip but we can use

1462
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,520
other aspects and i think that's kind of

1463
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,200
where we will see a lot of those

1464
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,558
detection systems go in the long run

1465
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,440
no more questions

1466
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,000
one two three

1467
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,200
okay thank you very much

1468
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,240
i
