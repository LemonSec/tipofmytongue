1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:01,740

um those of you on your phones that QR

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,960
code does work if you do want to scan

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,260
and follow the presentation

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,619
um because I see that some of you are

9
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,500
before I continue quick self Shameless

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,920
self-promotion my name is pratiksha and

I am a lawyer the doors are open and if

offended

14
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,860
um but to say that I am an academician I

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,380
studied and trained in India I qualified

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,200
in the UK now I work in Belgium I'm

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,620
doing my PhD in digital Law data law

18
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,200
consumer protection

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,420
and an aspect of which is competitive

20
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,379
law to introduce newer audiences

21
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,420
um to aspects that may not have been

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,420
seen before and that's the purpose of my

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,160
presentation today

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,940
um

25
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,440
again this is going to be a very

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,960
academic legal paper I promise you there

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,780
is not one line of code in all of these

28
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,020
slides presented I apologize but I'm not

29
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,920
sorry

30
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,040
um

31
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,760
um a quick run through of what I'm going

32
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,220
to do today with this audience I will

33
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,280
not even attempt to explain malware and

34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,979
botnet but I will go into what the

35
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,439
position is in India and my research

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,939
question

37
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,880
um so the research question that I did

38
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,780
want to analyze was should governments

39
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,600
um be entertained to provide solutions

40
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,140
to malware and botnet issues why

41
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,700
governments we had a very nice

42
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,700
conversation with Mata previously and we

43
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,500
saw the the dark side of the government

44
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,280
and banning accounts but with this case

45
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,020
study in India we also see that they're

46
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,899
providing some potential Solutions and

47
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,399
should they do this should they not do

48
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,280
this so the research is in two parts the

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,560
first part is very descriptive it

50
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,659
describes the position in India it

51
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,060
describes what they're doing what is the

52
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,940
center doing and the second part is more

53
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,280
normative the normative aspect answers

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,239
the question

55
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,480
ought they should do it from an economic

56
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,239
technological and a legal perspective so

57
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,860
stick around

58
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,520
um

59
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,400
a quick quick summary and a quick

60
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,800
historical note of what is this Center

61
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,420
in India

62
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,099
um so the ministry of information and

63
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:30,959
technology in India

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,239
um they had something called a cert you

65
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,980
all know what cert is

66
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,620
um and that was established in 2004.

67
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,860
however in 2014 the government of India

68
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,959
also launched something called as Swatch

69
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,180
Bharat abhyan which is supposed to be

70
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,060
clean into a campaign to clean the

71
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,700
streets for public sanitation it was

72
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,160
also used in multiple other programs and

73
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,959
one of the ways in which this clean

74
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,000
India campaign was used by the ministry

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,300
of Information Technology was to involve

76
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,120
and have a clean digital announcement

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,400
clean as in free of malware free of

78
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,700
botnet and 2017 they established the

79
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,580
Cyber Swatch Kendra the Cyber switch

80
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,040
Kendra is the malware analysis and

81
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,040
botnet Analysis Training Center so this

82
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,480
Center in a sense works this way

83
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,680
um they it in a very very nuanced very

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,340
minute Essence they try to analyze what

85
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,940
are the botnets how report incidents and

86
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,280
how they can be resolved in a very very

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,739
basic way

88
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:40,920
the alert users and you could click on

89
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,900
that link on that slide but I will

90
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,440
quickly run through the um the

91
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,239
screenshots from their website do

92
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,920
remember that they keep updating their

93
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,019
website so by the time you visit it it

94
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:54,120
might not be similar

95
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,879
um this is what the this is what the the

96
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,940
center does they provide security tools

97
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,900
for users to for use them to remove any

98
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,360
botnet or malware on their on their

99
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,900
devices when a user complains when a

100
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,420
user reports an incident that there is

101
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,879
malware on their system such tools can

102
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,699
be used these tools are provided by the

103
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,459
government and they're free

104
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,199
so you could download them and use them

105
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,139
if you need to

106
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,820
the government also encourages financial

107
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,100
institutions to use such tools because

108
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,320
they say that comes with government

109
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,440
backing we shall not discuss to what

110
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,780
extent government backing would help but

111
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,639
this is an option that is provided to

112
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,620
financial institutions if they are

113
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,180
affected by an emailware

114
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,380
um again these are relevant tools that

115
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,840
they use so this is provided to the

116
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,919
users for free as a user you could if

117
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:56,040
you do have an emailware issue use these

118
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,740
tools now comes the fun part of this

119
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,740
discussion to say should governments be

120
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,080
even providing such tools what is the

121
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,960
role of the government in

122
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,000
involving itself in research in

123
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,040
development and investing in the

124
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,919
provision of such tools well good

125
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,419
question

126
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,820
um okay we'll come back to that later

127
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,940
um to say okay this is we do this for

128
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,800
for the country we do this for the

129
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,900
benefit of society taking a very

130
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,180
paternalistic view they say no we have

131
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,940
the government and if Patrick is here

132
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,340
sorry from the Council of Europe is

133
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,039
Patrick was here he'd say yes we're in a

134
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,860
war with cyber security crimes and we

135
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,600
have to protect it and this is the view

136
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,699
of the government but very good

137
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,100
um from an economic perspective yes this

138
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,199
is beneficial to say we're working

139
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,960
towards larger economic benefit of the

140
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,639
country as a whole we're developing

141
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,039
digital economies therefore we want to

142
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,620
establish a clean digital environment

143
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,199
very good from a technological

144
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,080
perspective government argues that okay

145
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,840
we have know-how we have we have the

146
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,759
malware we have malba analysts and we

147
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,020
can say okay this is this is the

148
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,660
solution amazing but then what is the

149
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,880
flip side to this should governments be

150
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,500
doing this

151
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,020
um there is there is an extensive burden

152
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,940
on the economy coming from a country

153
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,620
like India where there are other

154
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,199
problems like Matan discussed we have

155
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,600
third world problems we have developing

156
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,639
country problems we have Global South

157
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,400
issues these issues not only include

158
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,740
poverty and hunger these issues also

159
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,780
include a budding and a fledgling

160
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,720
digital economy where where the internet

161
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,660
is in Norm in global North countries

162
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,680
internet is still a luxury in India the

163
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,419
government would have to keep up with

164
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,580
these technological know-hows they're

165
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,860
constantly developing which goes back to

166
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,240
this slide which says these are the

167
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,699
current threats that they advertise on

168
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,800
their on their website however if you

169
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,440
see it says new

170
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,039
on that and to establish a set list of

171
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,139
malware to say okay this is the malware

172
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,000
that's there these are the threats we'll

173
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,340
share these threats with you but this

174
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,020
list is going to be constantly being

175
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,300
updated and it's not going to be a

176
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,660
static list of of malware or issues or

177
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,880
threats that they face

178
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,580
and lastly which is more from a

179
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,819
competition perspective if certain tools

180
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,340
are advertised of sort by the government

181
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,080
to say okay these are the tools that we

182
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,419
say are useful then what happens to

183
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,220
private entities what happens to

184
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,860
companies that that indulge and that

185
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,699
invest in in providing Solutions if the

186
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,199
government is going to provide a free

187
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,479
workable solution private companies

188
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,220
would run out of business

189
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,800
our jobs would be at stake and it will

190
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,080
create an unusual Monopoly in the market

191
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,520
to say okay the government has a

192
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,500
solution why do we have to look anywhere

193
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,780
else very good

194
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,840
um to say one solution is better than

195
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,699
the other should governments do this or

196
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,039
should not governments do this I'm going

197
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,319
to give a very loyal lawyer-based answer

198
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,919
to say it depends it depends on this it

199
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,620
depends on the situation there's no one

200
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,720
answer whether governments should or

201
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,000
should not do this governments across

202
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,520
the world this is only a case study from

203
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,560
India governments across the world have

204
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,539
given reports to say okay these are

205
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,639
cyber security issues these are malware

206
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,919
and botnet issues however India has gone

207
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,500
one step further and established this

208
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,960
Center that lists out these threats that

209
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,020
provides these tools so why does it work

210
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,000
for a country like India should it work

211
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,700
for a country like India

212
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,320
yes it works for a country like India

213
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,260
because we are a very diverse population

214
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,000
we have a very lower middle income

215
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,040
country which means that we don't have

216
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,080
access to resources that can help fight

217
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,600
these Solutions so government providing

218
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,060
free Solutions does work to an extent

219
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,160
and when the government pitches ideas

220
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,519
like a digital India by 2030 and calls

221
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,500
for foreign investment in India in the

222
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,899
digital space we want to provide a clean

223
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,240
space so it works for a country like

224
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,260
India

225
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,720
what does this mean when I present this

226
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,640
to a European audience what does this

227
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,140
mean for you

228
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,940
um this just means that this is one

229
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,220
perspective from India will it work for

230
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,959
a country like France will it work for a

231
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,580
country like Germany will it work in the

232
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,480
EU

233
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,360
the answer is I don't know will it work

234
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,000
for another Global South Country the

235
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
answer is maybe this is a possible

236
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,100
potential solution where the government

237
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,500
May step in and they could provide

238
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,720
Solutions should the government do it

239
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,279
should not the government do it it

240
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,100
depends again it depends on National

241
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,140
regimes it depends on Sovereign goals

242
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,940
we're not going to say that we're

243
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,740
supposed to do this but as a lawyer we

244
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,080
can say okay let's take a step back and

245
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,959
as an academician debate debate and see

246
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,640
whether governments should or should not

247
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,040
do this yes this works for countries

248
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,519
like India this may not work here but

249
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,899
we're just going to open out the floor

250
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,220
and the same this is a possible solution

251
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,920
and yeah that's the end of my quick

252
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,839
presentation it was super short I

253
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,240
realized but the reason for this

254
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,240
supercell presentation is put to open up

255
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,940
the floor for questions because I want

256
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,440
to present my work in front of in

257
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,300
non-legal audience and to say okay has

258
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,760
my work reached here and as

259
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,519
practitioners in this space does the

260
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,820
solution make sense to you and I hope I

261
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,500
have confused you more than I have

262
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,360
convinced you at the end of this

263
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,420
presentation again you can scan the QR

264
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,279
code for my presentation and any other

265
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,620
questions you can reach out to me I will

266
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,660
be here all week but if you do want to

00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,060
avoid me like the plague it's fine I am

268
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,700
a lawyer I understand

269
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,940
any questions

270
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,180
thank you

271
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,220
yes

272
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,579
yeah

273
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,100
hi thank you for the presentation uh I

274
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,200
wanted to know if I'm let's say I'm a

275
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,140
Indian Citizen and uh the the government

276
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,420
recommend me some software to use and I

277
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,459
get infected by Marvel they describe yes

278
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,579
can I sue the government for misleading

279
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:31,560
me into using this tool and did you

280
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,540
think about these possibilities for the

281
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,360
citizen I will give you an example which

282
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,700
it did happen with that so during the

283
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,279
covet pandemic we had in India there was

284
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,380
a mandate to install certain

285
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,200
applications for covert tracking for

286
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,360
vaccination statuses there were

287
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,480
applications based on that

288
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,980
they took it a step further and they did

289
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,500
not have malware but all the health data

290
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,839
which is considered as very very crucial

291
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,500
data very personal data was leaked this

292
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,380
was not a malware malware issue but a

293
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,079
data breach issue and certain citizens

294
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,300
sued the government and they said well

295
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,240
we apologize we will fix this data

296
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,640
breach we're sorry

297
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,000
um but didn't take it further so it's an

298
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,680
example of where the government did make

299
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,560
a mistake it is a data breach uh taking

300
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,779
a step back taking the lawyer's point of

301
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:26,820
view India does not have a position like

302
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,579
the EU of the gdpr we do not have data

303
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,220
protection legislation it's still in its

304
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,260
Bill form we're still debating it still

305
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,200
happening but we don't have gdpr to

306
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,480
protect us so still Health Data is not

307
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,160
considered personal data but they said

308
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,740
well it's a data breach and you said if

309
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,180
we give you our data it will not be

310
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,320
breached

311
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,579
um the government said well sorry

312
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,620
we sorry I don't know what else to say

313
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,200
um this happened I believe in 2012 as

314
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,600
well with the other case where biometric

315
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,579
information was leaked

316
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,240
um

317
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,360
sorry we'll do better next time we don't

318
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,940
know what else to tell you

319
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,500
any other questions

320
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,420
but but thank you for your question it

321
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,880
just means that my legal knowledge has

322
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,399
gone to this audience which I'm very

323
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,940
thankful for

324
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,839
any other questions

325
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,680
who was it yeah

326
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,200
uh hi hello uh thanks for your talk it

327
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,000
was really interesting

328
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,620
um I was wondering you mentioned the

329
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,779
tools that the government was uh giving

330
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,660
to people are these tools uh developed

331
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,260
by the government itself or are they uh

332
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,540
working with some companies

333
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,040
oh they're not developed by the

334
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,600
government they entered into something

335
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,320
called

336
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,420
other they just buy the tools from

337
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,920
private companies or they enter into

338
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,380
public-private Partnerships to develop

339
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,620
these tools that which means that the

340
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,300
governments enter into contracts with

341
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,399
companies to say okay these are your

342
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,139
threats and these are the tools that we

343
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,360
want for these threats but again the

344
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,579
time that it takes to develop constantly

345
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:14,279
new tools to deal with constant new

346
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,660
threats

347
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,279
um I don't think the government is able

348
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,500
to keep up with in a realistic manner it

349
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,720
should work it theoretically yes this

350
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,399
seems very conducive for the government

351
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,320
that it gets the money and for the

352
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,660
company that makes the money as well but

353
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,740
practically I don't think it works

354
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,880
solely because the threats are

355
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,160
developing very rapidly and the tools

356
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,320
just can't keep up

357
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,120
but the government is trying so

358
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,079
thank you yes

359
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,060
you mentioned that the government spends

360
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,180
a lot of money in developing these tools

361
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,579
in their opinion would not make more

362
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:02,820
sense to spend this money on teaching

363
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,579
people how to protect itself

364
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:08,639
please give your take on that

365
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,399
um so one of the one of the agendas of

366
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,279
this the the spotner center is to

367
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,279
educate people and spread awareness that

368
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,139
has been the objective of the ministry

369
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,899
of information and Technology from its

370
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,360
from from its Origins to say okay we're

371
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,860
going to educate people we're going to

372
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,899
spread more awareness

373
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,300
um but where is this awareness going to

374
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,740
be spread when is this awareness going

375
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,000
to be spread is it going to be spread in

376
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,740
schools is it going to be spread to

377
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,980
every person who has a mobile device is

378
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,480
it going to be spread to every person

379
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,000
who buys an electronic device who is

380
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,560
this consumer who has to get this

381
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,540
information

382
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,220
another another layer of additional

383
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,019
complexity that's added when it comes to

384
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,880
India is which language should it be

385
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,040
spread this information in this website

386
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,839
if you can see on top it says English

387
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,120
and Hindi which are two languages in

388
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,760
India we have about 30 recognized

389
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,980
languages in India so what about the

390
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,199
other 28 languages

391
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,600
um though awareness has been a major

392
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,360
issue that is only one of the ways that

393
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,399
consumers are made aware of the

394
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,500
potential threats and they say yes don't

395
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,540
click on this don't click on spam where

396
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,420
I can tell my parents who are 65 to say

397
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,360
don't fall for this this is incorrect

398
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,820
but there has to be a level of okay

399
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,740
protection that the government wants to

400
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,440
provide so that's why they do this in a

401
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,540
in addition to Consumer awareness and

402
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,060
education uh yeah but they do spend

403
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,959
money on that as well

404
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,259
yeah um in the page where you show the

405
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,920
list of tools that you can download it

406
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,019
looks like there is no mention of Open

407
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,060
Source or stuff like this I remember

408
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,100
that we've covered in France it was a

409
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,660
big thing that the application was open

410
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,720
source even with that there was a lot of

411
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,760
discussion is there some kind of the

412
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,500
same discussion in India about this kind

413
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,459
of stuff

414
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,799
um the reason that these softwares these

415
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,079
antivirus tools or anti-malware tools

416
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,599
they're not open source is solely

417
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,179
because they've been bought but from the

418
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:19,380
private companies and the private

419
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,959
companies do want to keep them open so

420
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,359
closed but there are other tools that

421
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,459
are open source but they're just not

422
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,380
recommended or provided by the

423
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,419
government again that's where the

424
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:33,059
problem arises where these these certain

425
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,940
tools now generate a sort of Monopoly to

426
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,860
say okay that there is the government

427
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,380
recommends this why will I not use this

428
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,620
well it it needs a well-educated or a

429
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,660
rational consumer to say well let me

430
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,580
choose this instead because it has open

431
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,320
source software and I can see what is

432
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,559
happening rather than such tools but

433
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,960
these tools as of now they're not open

434
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,120
source there are other tools but they're

435
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,280
just not recommended by the government

436
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,380
again should the government even be

437
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,179
doing this we don't know

438
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,059
uh so I think it sounds like you

439
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,400
mentioned uh providing like resources

440
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,299
and education yes uh another issue I

441
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,520
think at least I've seen before

442
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,240
um is also uh you know kind of this idea

443
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
that sometimes privacy or security can

444
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,260
be a luxury right so we see like a lot

445
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,240
of older devices or lower end like

446
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,679
budget devices

447
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,600
has there been any consideration for

448
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,960
like either subsidizing devices or

449
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,120
um like working with companies to just

450
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,160
improve security like security of their

451
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,799
devices uh it's like

452
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,020
looking at actual devices that end up in

453
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,179
users hands as opposed to educating

454
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,500
um what the government takes steps to

455
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,020
ensure that devices that go out into the

456
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,720
market are more secure

457
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,820
uh

458
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,460
secretarian method of teaching do you

459
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,320
believe that would be anti-competitive

460
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,900
to say that that's the certain companies

461
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,120
cannot do something with their devices

462
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,640
would that be a restriction to your

463
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,440
research and development as a company to

464
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,299
say with the government when the

465
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,520
government puts a ban on some things

466
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,820
that I can and cannot do in in the EU we

467
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,860
there was a recent discussion to say all

468
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,200
of us are going to have USBC charges and

469
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,960
companies restrict went against that and

470
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,280
went Bonkers for a couple of years

471
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,440
saying this is this is our freedom to do

472
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,299
research and development and we want to

473
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,220
have what charger we want to have and

474
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,620
and charge 25 Euros to buy one charger

475
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,720
when the government starts putting

476
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,240
restrictions like this the companies

477
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,419
always have a contra point of view and

478
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,220
they will not listen

479
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,200
practically they will not listen to such

480
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,240
government restrictions unless there is

481
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,520
something in it for them so governments

482
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,360
usually try not to restrict companies

483
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,100
and their operations in certain ways

484
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,740
rather provide education

485
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,380
um but again to say that in India a

486
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,460
large majority of Internet users it is

487
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,799
exploded after 2016 because there was

488
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,020
there were there were multiple actions

489
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,780
that happened in 2016 that led to the

490
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,220
explosion of the internet and use of

491
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,000
mobile devices and it's 2016. we're not

492
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,220
talking about 1960s

493
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,480
so from 2016 until about 2023 all of

494
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,539
this the focus on Internet Security

495
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:45,240
Internet development infrastructure in

496
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,100
terms of handheld devices mobile phones

497
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,059
has again it's in its nascent stages uh

498
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:52,799
but the answer to your question in a

499
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,580
short way is no

500
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,480
it's very interesting to see it people

501
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,240
want to interact with the lawyer from my

502
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,039
experience they try to run away from me

503
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,900
but thank you

504
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,940
I'm not scared

505
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,100
don't bite I promise thank you for the

506
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,720
great information

507
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,280
um has there been some sort of

508
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,780
government disclosure on their

509
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,240
visibility into the data that is

510
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,179
uploaded or viewed by these boundware

511
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,760
softwares

512
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,159
kind of like the big brother concern is

513
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,260
how much visibility do they have into

514
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,740
what users upload to those malware uh

515
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,220
checkers

516
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,059
okay so does the government disclose

517
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:47,700
what the malware actually discloses

518
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,919
from the takes from the public in my

519
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:50,700
sense

520
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,640
or or yes what what data the government

521
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,740
has access to

522
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,100
from from the malware from what is

523
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,559
uploaded by the users

524
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,179
um

525
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:05,400
has the government explained if they

526
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,340
have access to the data and so on

527
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,799
because you could upload a a Word

528
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,960
document that you find suspicious and

529
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,159
okay uh

530
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:19,020
in short no

531
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,520
because

532
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,460
um but however we lawyers love to see

533
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,760
however however the government has a

534
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,080
program called the right to information

535
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,919
scheme where you can file a claim to ask

536
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,039
for information they say okay can I have

537
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,200
access to such information and the

538
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,360
government is mandated to disclose it to

539
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,419
you deeming fit

540
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:46,020
as a default no they do not disclose it

541
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,480
but it is a possibility to do so

542
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,740
but do we know if the government has

543
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,480
access to the data that was shared to

544
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,840
the software providers

545
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,500
um

546
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,020
I mean if you use such a tool then yes

547
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,220
because this is government run

548
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,000
yes no

549
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,340
I'm always up for debate so

550
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,080
am I understanding your question

551
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,240
correctly yeah well wouldn't that

552
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,299
dissuade individuals from using that

553
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,520
program if they're just handing over

554
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,580
information from their machines directly

555
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,980
to the government without having some

556
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,840
sort of like understanding of what the

557
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,918
government is collecting

558
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,900
the government says that these two these

559
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,780
tools work is that okay if you detect

560
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,419
malware on your device use this tool we

561
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,159
will resolve it for you

562
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:42,780
that is all the information that is

563
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,120
provided to the consumer very basic

564
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,340
information so the government does not

565
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,500
disclose any of the information that it

566
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,059
collects

567
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:54,480
but it could if you do file an RTI

568
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,140
is that included in that bill that is

569
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,659
you're like discussing is like the data

570
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,200
privacy part yes yes very much so it is

571
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,200
very much in line with the gdpr so that

572
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,299
that's what the bill is trying to do to

573
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,700
say okay people have data well let's try

574
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,380
to protect it

575
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,419
I will discuss this after this I'm not

576
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:17,039
I'm not very happy with the answer that

577
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,159
I've given you and I'm sorry for that

578
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,760
okay I think we're ready for the next

579
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,659
talk

580
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:28,260
okay oh okay thank you

581
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,379
thank you
