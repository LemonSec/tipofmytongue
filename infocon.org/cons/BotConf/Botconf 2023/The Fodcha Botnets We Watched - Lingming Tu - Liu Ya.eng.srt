1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
my topic is the first chapter as we

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,580
watched

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,400
we have maybe we have fun in the next 30

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,620
minutes

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,040
um first who are we as you can see let's

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,699
know we here just me for some reason my

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,600
colleague can come I'm I'm lonely

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,580
um I'm asking from netlab Office 360 I

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,400
used to work as malware analysis analyst

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,340
and kernel developer at a security

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,079
company kingsoft and customer ski not at

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,600
the net lab we might have we mainly

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,360
focus on Linux my web

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,300
we do have some special fundings this

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,450
year's

16
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,840
[Music]

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,920
for example a backdoor which named the

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,420
catalua which is the first Linux manual

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,960
use the Doh technique and another one

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,140
the multi is a P2P iot botnet it has

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,760
been talked twice at the at our but not

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,240
confluence

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,119
um I also want to do a little of PR of

24
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,040
my missing guy

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,720
he is his name is chuanji his

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,880
um some kind of Open Source guy he do

27
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,900
develop a lot of

28
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,659
useful utilities like some other script

29
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,259
script which you can

30
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:44,299
recover golden binary symbols

31
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,640
okay here's the plan

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,399
um I decided to divide the talk into

33
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,520
three parts the first one is about the

34
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,860
details about the personal first

35
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,780
subordinate itself

36
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,240
and this thought may be interesting and

37
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,880
the second one is some tedious

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,560
statistics

39
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,720
and the last one is some campaigns

40
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,599
um there are some campaigns we cannot

41
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,720
say in detail there's some protection

42
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,879
also there are some public affairs we

43
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,859
can we can talk talk to you guys

44
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,400
okay

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,640
to keep us in the same picture I like to

46
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,120
do a brief introduction to the Photoshop

47
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,900
on that some of you may know what it it

48
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,300
is because we had already published the

49
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,099
two blog of it

50
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,580
and the asked the most popular superstar

51
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,560
States the charge GPT had no clue but it

52
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,560
can bring up it can bring it because the

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,680
child gbt Only Knows since only no

54
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
lessons before

55
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,200
2021 and the first time is the botnet

56
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,440
which showed up in 2022

57
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,640
and it's many Targets on iot devices and

58
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,760
during the development it absorbed a lot

59
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,159
of features of the reliable net

60
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,780
and also

61
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,379
it had its own characteristics such as

62
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:24,900
use tea and algorithm to play to put to

63
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,300
protect

64
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,379
its resources and the network

65
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:31,220
communication

66
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,879
uh let's

67
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,459
generator 12 is the first time we

68
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,299
captured the virtual samples

69
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:45,420
at the auto credits belongs to

70
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,080
my colleague which he is or a Honeypot

71
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,319
guy

72
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,040
um

73
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,459
I finished the summer analysis in one

74
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,220
hour and the

75
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,799
through the time you can see how simple

76
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,280
it is at the first version at that time

77
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,540
I don't think Photoshop was watching to

78
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,159
strike but the one insists so we start

79
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,918
tracking on generally let's

80
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:20,720
13.

81
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,040
I still remember

82
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,000
there's a bite between R and the one and

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,440
we

84
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,500
we

85
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,280
the bite is about how long it will take

86
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,880
for Photoshop to die and between us the

87
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,220
wind would be the big brother I choose

88
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,280
maybe three or four days it will die but

89
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,759
one choose at least one month

90
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,220
um after the first time one is so silent

91
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,740
because

92
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,919
um the C2 do not deliver any other

93
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,919
commands just a heartbeat but all things

94
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:03,540
changed when when it comes day seven

95
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,940
it's about a generated 20.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,740
um it's our first time to check the

97
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,440
doors record from the first time and

98
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,440
since that day photo had not stopped the

99
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,220
path of those attacks it infected so

100
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,520
many devices that code that causing the

101
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,520
attention of cncert

102
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:29,590
um

103
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,650
[Music]

104
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,160
this is the future should all the

105
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,180
other parts both appears from March 2029

106
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,240
to April 10 the total number of unique

107
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,360
but IPA had exceeded

108
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,199
um

109
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,020
six six two thousand and the Daily

110
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,900
Number fluctuates around the

111
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,000
unten thousand

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,860
so

113
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,680
but I had for this I had to become a

114
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,020
thread that cannot be ignored

115
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,259
based on this info we decided to

116
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:15,539
disclosure the first chapter net and to

117
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,180
contain the it contained in version 1

118
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,620
and version two and the blog is

119
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,840
with sensored Scala and

120
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,720
and after after that the first chapter

121
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,740
net you can see he leave a messenger on

122
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,900
his new sample

123
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,639
and uh it's just just he just said never

124
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,340
please leave me alone I Surrender of

125
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,600
course we are happy as as if our works

126
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
value has been

127
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,380
affirmed but it's kind of fake move

128
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,380
and the first is was still involving

129
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,300
um about uh

130
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,960
um one month

131
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,780
we capture another version it use a

132
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,120
so-called openly realities

133
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,039
a quick question

134
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,560
however how many of you guys heard about

135
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,300
the Urban League theories

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,020
not so much

137
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,539
yes good

138
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,080
uh what what is opening TRD let's take a

139
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,599
picture let's say the future it's just

140
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:37,740
some

141
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,160
some kind of we can say it's come we

142
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,620
adhere this someplace we can see that

143
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,380
they are totally different from the TRS

144
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,300
under I can season

145
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,360
are something we are familiar with

146
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,060
like.com DOT net something like that and

147
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,560
the

148
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,479
and also about the this version

149
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,020
recapture is just it is it's just a

150
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,199
bitter version it's used to test we

151
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,780
think it's used to test the

152
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,739
invisibilities of an opening theaters

153
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,400
about five days later we capture another

154
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,020
version

155
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,120
um V3

156
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,120
is

157
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,199
um in this version the author and

158
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,179
redesigned the communication protocol

159
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,240
and start to use ta and the charger 20

160
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,760
algorithm to protect the

161
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,099
its result is resource and the network

162
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,760
communication and at the same time a

163
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,080
dual C2 scheme with open Nick domain at

164
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,580
the primary C2 and I can domain as a

165
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,080
backup

166
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,019
C2 was adopt

167
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,399
right so

168
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,160
oh

169
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,000
this one

170
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,760
okay

171
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,260
it's about

172
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:18,060
two months yes in fact the version 3

173
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,200
um

174
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,160
has used is version 3 is very close to

175
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,519
the version version 4.

176
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,519
um

177
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,700
some difference is version 4 changes the

178
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,560
sensitive resources

179
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,140
the way of sensitive resources and

180
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,660
remove some features remove some

181
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,360
featuresless entry sandbox anti

182
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,440
debugging or NT emulation

183
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,580
and uh a very uh interesting point is

184
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,240
that first has started run Center doors

185
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,940
what is one centilos

186
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,120
just look at Luke's future

187
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,800
um

188
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,459
he embedded The Ransom messenger into

189
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:09,620
the attacker attack payload and ask that

190
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,300
the targets to send some Capital

191
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:20,040
to a specific wallet but it seems the

192
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,260
wallet is not valid

193
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,760
so we just think he is just trying to

194
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,420
make more profit and since he do not

195
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,680
work in this way

196
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,040
okay well um first I was busy attacking

197
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,120
various attacks but it has not got to

198
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,560
mess with us you can see he he the

199
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,120
phrase the list code as one of its skin

200
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,880
payload the least do you guys know what

201
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,279
are this this could mean

202
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,820
is that not level cake

203
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,480
and uh we are kind of angry and they

204
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,140
decide to show our Fist and two days

205
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,880
later

206
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:18,420
and so we decided to write a new blog to

207
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,700
um disclosure the version 3 and the

208
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,820
version 4. and about two days later

209
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,660
a new messenger was delivered in the

210
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,600
updated samples it says please leave

211
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,880
alone he he didn't provoke

212
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,980
I think it's kind of breathing right

213
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,010
and okay

214
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,160
[Music]

215
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,300
um

216
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,060
no let's back to the function

217
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,839
just and the information before it's

218
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,880
just some kind of interesting

219
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,279
interesting story when we fight with the

220
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,160
first Harbor night no let no let's back

221
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,420
to the function of the first itself

222
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,040
um as we all know

223
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,860
um Mirai is definitely a peak when we

224
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,860
talk about the iot botnets many button

225
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,760
ads

226
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,220
have borrowed the code formula and the

227
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,380
Photoshop is no exception at the

228
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,000
the similarity and the different

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,060
difference issue

230
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,640
in the pbd but as a term for example

231
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,560
also has its own unique features

232
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,660
technical

233
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,019
first about what I had learned from like

234
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:54,360
something like a table in it this is a

235
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,500
very

236
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,519
um

237
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,040
clear features he learned

238
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,980
if if you guys are familiar with Milo I

239
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,360
and you you can you can see you can when

240
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,600
you see this picture you guys may laugh

241
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,639
and also

242
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,060
there are some

243
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:31,139
the definition of the attack ID this

244
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,180
variable comes from the source code of

245
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,560
the photography too

246
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,459
okay

247
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,339
although he learned something but

248
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:46,920
he just he had his own characters

249
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,560
um for some for example he used two

250
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,260
algorithms one is

251
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,040
um ta another is chapter 20 and they

252
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,700
have different lure the TA used to

253
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,240
protect sensitive resources this

254
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,779
including opening 62 and and

255
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:12,839
some slogan or something like that and

256
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,200
uh 20 algorithm protect Communications

257
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,300
from stage two

258
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,160
and list these two features these two

259
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,680
pictures are traffic from version 2 and

260
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,100
the version and four at first glance

261
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,260
they are completely different right

262
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,079
but Infinity

263
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:42,959
they can they are in the same fourth

264
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,480
stage

265
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,959
in stage one just make is negotiation

266
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,959
negotiator one is just a mixture of both

267
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,560
nc2 get the same charger

268
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,760
2220 key switch and 32

269
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,720
um part and C2 senders

270
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,480
extended some specific info to each

271
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,279
other and

272
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,760
they are encrypted with the chapter 20

273
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,320
algorithm if the both side thinkers the

274
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,260
other side is their Mr right so that

275
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,019
goes to stage three

276
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,279
um

277
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,339
there are two different there are two

278
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:27,720
different

279
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,440
as you can see the first one is um

280
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,800
version 2 version 2 has no has no

281
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,079
padding and the version 3 and the

282
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,500
version 4 have padding and the the other

283
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,980
one is in version two the

284
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,019
um

285
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:49,980
test and in version 3 or version 4 the

286
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,560
um

287
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,980
server test about the C2 and products we

288
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,740
have very detailed discussion uh

289
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,620
description as of on two blocks if you

290
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,720
guys are interested you can find you can

291
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,760
find there

292
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,240
okay just the back here

293
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,760
as you can see on top of padding just

294
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,220
the look at the padding look at the

295
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,899
lower

296
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:23,600
um the big one you can see at the offset

297
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,940
of the at the offset of six the value is

298
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:34,019
16 in HEX so it means the

299
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:39,660
um next 16 16 beds at the padding this

300
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,019
is this is just we talk about what is

301
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,560
the padding

302
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,880
okay let's go next part

303
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:54,680
talk about the opening 62 and they had

304
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,560
these are advantages of the open xc2 I

305
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,320
think everyone who engages in the dark

306
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,600
upgrade industry will leverage from both

307
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,119
of them ahead

308
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,459
this domain take a look

309
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:13,199
this is the open nickel Institute from

310
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,579
from The Sims version version 2 or

311
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,799
version and the version three

312
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:23,240
and the sum of from version 2 to version

313
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,699
4. you can see the phrase

314
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:30,740
and their kind of racist

315
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,299
yes right

316
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,780
and the

317
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,880
and the list domains are after we

318
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,940
publish they used after we published the

319
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,500
second blog

320
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,980
and all of this there's still some

321
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,220
um and unless the Discrimination words

322
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,179
but it's obviously more compromised also

323
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:57,720
take at the one Let's Make a Deal No we

324
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,440
don't make a deal

325
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,120
um

326
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,840
let us just just know we just now we see

327
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,220
there are certain ethnic domains too and

328
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,460
how about how many appear used about how

329
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,880
many IP use the battle for Turbo net

330
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,580
um

331
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:24,299
when we when you want to see the IP used

332
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:28,740
by the opening domain you must you can

333
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,320
use it with the Dig command and the

334
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,320
button but you must with some specific

335
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,600
DNS resolver

336
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,720
can you see last picture

337
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,120
is is you

338
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,460
um you can find more info on the opening

339
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,020
website it provides a list of

340
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:52,620
DNS resolvers so you can try it

341
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:52,910
um

[Music]

343
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:58,260
we we found the layout there are nothing

344
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,860
IPS behind the last

345
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:05,340
130 190 IPS behind the certain domains

346
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,539
and they look located at 10 countries

347
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:13,400
and the belongs to 10 service provider

348
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,480
it's impossible to as as we mentioned

349
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,460
before it's impossible to take over the

350
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,580
application tool and the

351
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,620
if we want to take over 19 IPS from

352
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,220
10 providers 10 service provider at the

353
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,059
same time this you already need a lot of

354
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:42,320
resources and the cooperation

355
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,080
sometimes it's love frustrating thing

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,679
about the blog when we write a blog

357

with with the

359
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,660
with blood sometimes but it seems nobody

360
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,120
cares we don't make the world a better

361

place

362
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,440
but in this case but not always

363
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,120
in this case

364
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,179
in the first case let us someone else

365
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:12,840
kept care about love for this heart

366

almost

392
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:52,520
thousands of iot devices

400
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,220
don't verify if ham log is for the and

totally more generous speaking there are

451
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,440
two methods of tracking

452
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,640
um

453
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640

the protocols are obtained the value

461
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,400
reverse engineering

462
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,400
and it has some advantages like a better

463
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,360
control and we are not take part in the

464
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,600
those attacks and if they also another

465
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,360
another one they call the bot Farm just

00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,100
and we like to say the first half a

513
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,360
night

514
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,299
um lunch

515
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:17,760
into those attacks that's their lot more

516
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,960
this can you say it's clear okay it's

517
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,140
just Future shoes and its targets all

518
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,460
over the world and

519
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,820
100 100 countries

520
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,220
this is the figures this is how

521
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,779
and

522
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:43,200
totally attached

523
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,919
file

524
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,740
I think I think this part are quite

525
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:54,440
tedious so let's go very fast okay

526
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,620
one okay

527
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:04,799
and also we have uh deduct vectors is

528
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,820
the top this is the top 10 attack method

529
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,600
not good and about the export it export

530
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,419
it used by the volatile something like

531
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:16,440
that

532
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,159
if you you guys want more detail on more

533
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,020
details of

534
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,880
um

535
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,880
statistically the data you can contact

536
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,320
me data after the talk

537
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,720
okay

538
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,340
this

539
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,520
report scale and this part is

540
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,080
interesting

541
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,960
um in fact we have

542
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,140
we have we have a measure the scale of

543
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,260
the scale of the first time three times

544
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,340
the first term is Under The Hub of less

545
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,159
uncensored but easily is limited and

546
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,460
since only has a version of China

547
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,820
he lost the version of the world so the

548
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,419
number of this one is it's just part of

549
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:11,179
its scale and the second just we can use

550
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:14,640
the numbers from the panel at that time

551
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,460
we have the access to the control

552
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:22,799
terminal the number is about 36

553
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,460
sergeant

554
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,840
and the

555
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,399
steer

556
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:33,899
we just get a number and we want to and

557
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:37,559
see the distribution of the

558
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,840
um both so

559
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,039
we when we have the access to the

560
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:49,320
control terminal we tried and use it to

561
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,440
launch it and the doors

562
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,320
to a preset IP

563
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,240
so we can do the some statistics

564
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:07,260
which had just once and the number is 19

565
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:14,039
000 and some it looks all it looks the

566
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,460
boards are located all over the world

567
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,070
there's no

568
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,250
[Music]

569
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,860
um

570
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,658
yes okay

571
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,539
um come to like campaigns like some

572
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:34,380
campaigns we can talk in the detail and

573
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,140
the first one is is

574
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,880
um attack has code organization of some

575
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,320
and some province of China at that time

576
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,539
there are still there's a curve and

577
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:52,260
covid-19 problems in China and if you

578
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,480
have not

579
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,059
um green code you cannot go go to school

580
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:03,179
go to work or you can buy you can buy

581
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:06,600
things in the shop so this this to talk

582
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,500
to dra to really have influence to our

583
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,820
real life

584
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,880
this is one another one is

585
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,760
we have to fix the evidence of a

586
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,779
business of a voice business company

587
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:31,080
and please ask the suspect to attack a

588
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,000
preset ipe and finally we found in our

589
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,399
tracking system we find the large

590
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,700
targeted towards attacking so

591
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,059
and at that time maybe the the suspect

592
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:47,940
is just one of the customers of the

593
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,220
photo

594
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:54,020
that's another one is about

595
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,120
um

596
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:01,380
cloud service provider and he their

597
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,440
service is influenced severely he asked

598
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,020
he asked us if any clue we just compare

599
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:17,000
the data we we see is the first half and

600
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,799
the traffic is huge is exceeding one TVs

601
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,500
also that's something we can say with

602
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,760
names just navigate.com was attacked and

603
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,500
look at nabcat was a

604
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,140
database is a database

605
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,740
which is widely used and it seems they

606
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,880
have a a news Tuesday

607
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,760
they are influenced by The Doors attack

608
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,179
and the about the about this event and

609
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:57,539
some allies have their

610
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:00,779
um conclusions let's say the right

611
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:05,460
button as is number is the Killer and

612
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,820
and there's something bigger

613
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,179
but from our point of view and not on

614
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:16,099
not more right but for this what

615
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:21,719
included in take part in this attack and

616
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:26,639
the first half is 10 or 10 to 100 times

617
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,899
bigger than normal I

618
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,199
you can you can see the difference

619
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,799
directly here

620
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,639
and finally we get we come to the

621
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,500
conclusions

622
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,460
and we think the first upon that

623
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,460
its infected devices and attacks devices

624
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,339
located over the world and also itself

625
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:58,500
is deduct ability to some customers

626
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,000
and he is he he did not Target a

627
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,240
specific country or specific

628
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,460
industry just to give just the money

629
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,339
driven give me give him money he he will

630
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:12,780
do everything

631
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:17,760
and the first itself is quite simple and

632
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,820
I believe there are a lot of buttoners

633
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,260
like Forza

634
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,720
over there we guys

635
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,119
just keep fighting

636
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,099
and the blog sometimes works yes the the

637
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:33,420
bad guys

638
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,140
the bikers want us to build a knife to

639
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,960
attack their competitors we're happy to

640
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,760
do that yes and the last one is

641
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,339
is

642
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:50,480
it means when we

643
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,320
analysis A matter where we can sometimes

644
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,460
it's easy but it will go to a huge one

645
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,720
and some somewhere is so complicated we

646
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,760
take so many times to analysis but it

647
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,240
goes It goes to that in two or three

648
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,000
days it just makes me unhappy so it's

649
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
just a business that was like a box of

650
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,060
chocolates you never know what you are

651

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,540
during the uh

657
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:47,040
the dinner together I hate to paint it
