1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,140
[Applause]

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,958
this is my talk and this is the agenda

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,319
in a very briefly everything is still be

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,240
white so if you want a live stream it on

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,920
Tick Tock if that's your thing then go

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,420
ahead

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,059
a very brief condensed resume pick from

8
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,699
this what you find interesting

9
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,740
um small disclaimer I live in Greece at

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,420
the moment Greece had a big spyware

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,359
scandal going on affecting politicians

12
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,619
journalists

13
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,560
um I don't do any work on Greece and I'm

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,820
not going to talk about that but that's

15
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,900
definitely a big thing

16
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,000
um since February of last year I've been

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,800
working for internus which is a large

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,320
International NGO non-governmental

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,420
organization most of what we do is

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,579
supporting media Independent Media

21
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,020
around the world

22
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,160
um capacity building trainings Etc

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,020
um most of the work is not directly

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,300
linked to cyber security in any way but

25
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,399
we have a small what we call internet

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,320
freedom and resilience teams about 20

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,780
people working on various topics related

28
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,099
to digital security and I work on

29
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,799
digital threats against this

30
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,720
the communities and that's what I'm

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,119
talking about

32
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,100
um Civil Society is is one of these

33
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,600
terms that you know it when you see it

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,159
and yes I know that's a reference but

35
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,780
something else but

36
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,460
um it's basically the glue that makes

37
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,140
society that makes a healthy Society

38
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,780
work um that's not the government or the

39
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,280
private sector so

40
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,900
I think media plays a very important

41
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,500
role in a healthy Society but also

42
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,180
organizations that support various

43
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,180
rights of of various marginalized groups

44
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,820
trade unions not everything in Civil

45
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,159
Society is necessarily political or

46
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,720
controversial

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,220
um but many of the organizations

48
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,920
especially in more authoritarian parts

49
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,979
of the world are

50
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,360
um rest of the world which is the Durham

51
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,659
I invented to to basically mean

52
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,399
countries that you don't normally hear

53
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,619
about here at dot coms

54
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,439
um a related term is is the global South

55
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,720
um or in the past the third world but

56
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,520
that doesn't really include uh Eastern

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,320
Europe and I do want to include Eastern

58
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,580
Europe because there's very um

59
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,720
interesting and important things

60
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,480
happening there as you probably know

61
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,340
I think it's good to

62
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,680
understanding in what context Civil

63
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,720
Society operates in the rest of the

64
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,680
world

65
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,660
um for example censorship and internet

66
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,879
shutdowns are very common internet

67
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,280
sometimes shut down because there's a

68
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,319
protest going on that's also what makes

69
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,180
it different from say here in France I

70
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,739
know there were really big protests I

71
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,060
don't think the government even for a

72
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,560
second considered shutting down the

73
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,140
internet to prevent people from

74
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,780
from protesting

75
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,340
misinformation disinformation that's

76
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,540
really big in some parts of the world

77
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,720
that's also why good media is important

78
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,160
members of Civil Society groups are

79
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,280
often harassed groups also have often a

80
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,480
very complex relationship with the

81
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,220
government sometimes it's very

82
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,260
adversarial but some that it's more

83
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,060
complex they work well with certain

84
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,620
government departments and are harassed

85
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,080
by others sometimes they're slightly

86
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,459
concerned about their own government but

87
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,319
even more about the foreign government

88
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,440
for for reasons and yeah some face very

89
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,980
serious non-bigital threats including

90
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,560
people are sometimes skilled for there

91
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,420
for this kind of work

92
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,780
so more context network connections are

93
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,959
unreliable one example there is that in

94
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,459
some parts of the world it is very

95
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,400
common for even government websites not

96
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,340
to have proper certificates as in they

97
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,540
have certificates but they're

98
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,360
self-signed or outdated as a consequence

99
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,400
people just know how to bypass this and

100
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,959
I think you can imagine what that means

101
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,400
for the security of the internet if

102
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,860
people

103
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,640
mindlessly know how to bypass

104
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,280
certificate warnings um correct software

105
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,620
and generally poor security hygiene are

106
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,500
very common in general in many parts of

107
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,879
the world

108
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,560
um and as you probably know cracked

109
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,360
software often comes with things like

110
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,239
key loggers and other kinds of malware

111
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,140
um

112
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,540
it's even crack software is sometimes so

113
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,459
common that organizations use cracked

114
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,140
software even if they have the money or

115
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,879
even the license keys and I've seen

116
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,040
cases of that that's pretty sad to

117
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,319
realize that and yeah there's not a lot

118
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,939
of funding and

119
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,799
this work can be really traumatizing and

120
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,440
sometimes also traumatizing events

121
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,660
related to say what the government is

122
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,418
doing leads people to do this kind of

123
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:22,860
work and I'll talk a little bit about

124
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,139
trauma later

125
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,300
before I go to the the core of the talk

126
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,940
I want to take a small step back

127
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,440
I grew up in a western country I've

128
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,699
lived in in sort of Western countries

129
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,139
all my life

130
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,759
I've never had to worry about being

131
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,979
arrested for my work I've never had to

132
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,199
deal with with proper censorship

133
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,180
um if you want to understand what this

134
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,160
work really means try really try to talk

135
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,620
for someone from the rest of the world

136
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,199
but for various reasons it's much harder

137
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,639
for them to come here than it is for me

138
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,800
so yeah

139
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,180
but that's I think an important

140
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,800
disclaimer for me to make

141
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,540
so digital threats so this is what we're

142
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,100
going to talk about Pegasus because

143
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,680
you've all heard about Pegasus

144
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,660
but actually and maybe sadly if you're

145
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,680
here for the the very apt stuff

146
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,900
um most threats that that we deal with

147
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,479
are really mundane there

148
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,820
account takeovers of Facebook of

149
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,120
Instagram of Google and related to that

150
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,500
YouTube

151
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,479
these accounts are often really

152
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,400
important for people there are parts of

153
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,139
the world where Facebook is the internet

154
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,780
and it's also much harder for

155
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,280
governments to censor these platforms so

156
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,320
journalists are on Facebook or on

157
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,120
Instagram or

158
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,780
um

159
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,180
a TV channel is basically on YouTube so

160
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,860
if they lose their YouTube account they

161
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,419
basically

162
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,100
um can't do anything

163
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,660
um many account takeovers are not

164
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,120
particularly targeted or not targeted at

165
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,039
all it's just

166
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,479
something's also very mundane like

167
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,400
simple phishing people don't have do

168
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,960
away

169
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,759
um but if your threat Model includes

170
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,220
your authoritarian government that's the

171
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,380
first thing you think about

172
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,960
um related slide about that but

173
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,120
sometimes websites get hacked in various

174
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,800
ways and spam is posted and people also

175
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,180
think oh maybe it's the government the

176
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,100
hack my website but it's just you know

177
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,919
outdated WordPress plugin that link to

178
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,080
uh

179
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,000
um and some massive campaign but if if

180
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,500
that's what you're worried about then

181
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,000
it's more of a concern

182
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,900
um

183
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,440
session hijacks are also very common and

184
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,840
feel the same as an account takeover

185
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,160
um as you probably know that there's

186
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,740
like invoice dealers and Rogue browser

187
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,319
extensions that make it very easy for

188
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,139
cyber criminals to high-tech sessions

189
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,780
um I've seen seen a lot of that and in

190
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,280
this case if even if you have like

191
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,000
strong to have a your session and

192
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,440
through your feeling your account still

193
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,180
gets attacked

194
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,819
um accounts often get blocked as well

195
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,940
um if you're many governments have

196
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,180
supporters or if not to have botnets

197
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,460
that can just report say a journalist's

198
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,780
Facebook account

199
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,940
and Facebook

200
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,620
I know they try but they're not always

201
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,120
very great at moderating these things

202
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,319
like oh we get a lot of reports that

203
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,060
just block the account of a journalist

204
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,580
that's hard and frustrating

205
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,639
um

206
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,080
last Autumn just after Elon Musk took

207
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,300
over Twitter he banned six American

208
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,819
journalists from Twitter because they

209
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,680
wrote things that he didn't like

210
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,740
um that made a lot of news all over the

211
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,020
world but especially in in the west

212
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,560
um

213
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,840
and rightly so and also rightly so they

214
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,000
got their accounts back but yeah people

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,580
all over the world get that journalists

216
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,780
all over the world to get their Twitter

217
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,180
and Facebook account band all the time

218
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,919
and that never makes the news that it

219
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,300
was a little bit sad

220
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,580
um I know of one case where

221
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,039
a journalist or at least a someone who

222
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,360
is very critical of the government and

223
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,139
very public Facebook account hacked and

224
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,960
child sexual abuse image was was posted

225
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,240
by the hackers which let an

226
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,800
understandably to an automatic block and

227
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,139
it was all very frustrating to get that

228
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,819
back

229
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,979
um one small thing about takeovers of

230
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,740
WhatsApp signal and telegram which I

231
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,300
should probably know are linked to uh to

232
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,280
a phone number

233
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,319
um and therefore to SMS if you have

234
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,180
access to SMS you can go for someone's

235
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,800
WhatsApp account for example if they

236
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,560
don't use a password to protect it and

237
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,840
governments often have access to SMS

238
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,479
through corrupt isps or just to Legal

239
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,120
powers and yeah I've seen that happen

240
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,919
um and telegram is kind of worse because

241
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,220
telegram doesn't use encryption which

242
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,900
means that if you take over someone's

243
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,700
account you get their chat history as

244
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,820
well

245
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:35,940
um

246
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,520
there's also a lot of cyber crime

247
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,779
targeting organizations

248
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,360
that you know just because you do really

249
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,679
good work doesn't mean that people are

250
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,060
not trying to steal your money this was

251
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,700
a business email compromise scam I

252
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,620
helped

253
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,519
solve or recover some time ago

254
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,959
um

255
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,260
there was a small NGO doing something

256
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,080
very non-political uh receiving

257
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,899
um money from a western donor to buy

258
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,300
Goods for the thing that we're doing and

259
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,560
the donor was supposed to send the money

260
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,660
to their supplier and the supply

261
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,940
wouldn't send the goods to the NGO

262
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,800
um what happened is that the ndo's Yahoo

263
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,540
account got hacked this NGO only used

264
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,700
Yahoo that's not uncommon it was also

265
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,440
not probably not very well protected the

266
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,540
account might be phishing might be

267
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,459
password reuse

268
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,320
pretty hard to find out what the real

269
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,120
root cause was

270
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,060
um and that's enough because emails from

271
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,560
the donor were filtered there was a

272
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,060
filtering rule set up we also found out

273
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,580
that emails were sent from the supplier

274
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,440
from what was supposed to be supplier

275
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,899
but a slightly modified domain that made

276
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,339
it to the

277
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:44,160
to the Yahoo inbox and maybe they were

278
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,839
actually block the spam initially but

279
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:46,920
you know if you have access to the

280
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,660
account you can move them from spam to

281
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,100
uh to

282
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,740
um to the Inbox and mark them as unread

283
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,300
and therefore kind of control the whole

284
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,740
conversation and

285
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,720
the amount involved was really small for

286
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,519
BBC like a few thousand dollars but it

287
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,399
was also really big for this this NGO

288
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,899
um on the

289
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,420
on the right you see the the properties

290
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,560
of the

291
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,200
Word document that was sent by by the

292
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,000
scammers That was supposed to prove the

293
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
new account uh last state by carti

294
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,920
tradings which I looked up which is a

295
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,720
company based in Nigeria

296
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,220
which if you know a little bit about BAC

297
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,779
scams is probably relevant

298
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,459
um a slightly more advanced actor is

299
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,980
Mustang Panda also known as Earth prata

300
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,360
and some other names I know Nick Dai is

301
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,300
going to talk about

302
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,800
tomorrow and I'll leave all the

303
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,440
technical details to him

304
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,480
um it's an actor linked to the Chinese

305
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,760
government

306
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,380
does fairly broad targeting it's not

307
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,060
extremely targeted and it basically just

308
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,100
intelligence gathering

309
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,560
um and they've targeted ngos and media

310
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,440
organizations and I have supported a few

311
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,060
cases where someone was targeted with

312
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,680
Mustang panda

313
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,480
and then and then you get questions like

314
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,680
so what does it mean that we were

315
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,140
targeted this is an organization that

316
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,980
was

317
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,500
working on the very authoritarian regime

318
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,600
what they were very much supposed to but

319
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,640
they also knew from public report that

320
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,380
their government was also targeted with

321
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,680
Muslim fund like it's very confusing and

322
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,019
what does it mean and also

323
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,959
technical questions like

324
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,040
um

325
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,459
does antivirus detectives you know the

326
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,200
particular email that that I helped

327
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,060
analyzed that wasn't uh opened or at

328
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,560
least uh executable it was the yellow

329
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,240
hijacking was never run so that was okay

330
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,800
but you know they assumed that other

331
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,120
people within the organization were also

332
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,700
targeted maybe never reported

333
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,380
can we just scan a machine with

334
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,959
antivirus I know it does some some

335
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,760
persistence like some some register Keys

336
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,079
it sets

337
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,760
um how do you clean a machine do you

338
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,899
really need to reinstall operating

339
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:47,880
system is there any chance that if one

340
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,940
computer in the organization is infected

341
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,260
that Autos are too you know these

342
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,240
organizations are small they usually

343
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,160
don't have full-time I.T stuff they

344
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,019
definitely don't have a sock and I read

345
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,760
a lot of reports on Mustang Panda and

346
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,899
it's really hard for me to answer

347
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:02,640
questions based on the reports that all

348
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,040
go on a lot of technical details on all

349
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,519
the fancy dll hijacking and how plug X

350
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,779
is is loaded um

351
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:14,519
if you write such reports try to think

352
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,740
of the targets and how uh what they

353
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,700
would need to get out of this

354
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,360
um

355
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,980
you've probably no you definitely heard

356
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,660
of data breaches and you know how data

357
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,959
breaches where information is is leaked

358
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,240
publicly how damaging that can be for

359
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,240
for a company say after a ransomware

360
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,399
um this is a slight very nasty twist to

361
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,060
this

362
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,760
which is where people including some

363
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,279
some journalists were hacked

364
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,260
their emails were published but some of

365
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,120
them were manipulated before they were

366
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,740
published

367
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,639
um

368
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,959
which means that you have a very

369
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,880
credible

370
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,779
throw for documents of emails

371
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,220
some of which are just not true and

372
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,839
they're probably damaged their

373
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,639
reputation

374
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,380
um this was used in this particular case

375
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,500
is by fancy bear the Russian group uh

376
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,360
there's a public report by citizen lab

377
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,440
from six years ago

378
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,420
sort of relate to this and this is far

379
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,639
more recent there's a Revenge form or

380
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,860
non-cancelable non-consensual sharing of

381
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,420
intimate images

382
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,760
um in this case in Azerbaijan where

383
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,620
Intimate photos and audio recordings

384
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,120
from a number of anti-government

385
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,459
activists were published government of

386
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:27,779
course denies it you know it was just

387
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,940
Anonymous Twitter account sharing it and

388
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,200
that they happen to be trending in the

389
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,579
country

390
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,800
um there's a possibility that these

391
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,480
images and recordings are obtained

392
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,820
through spyware we know Azerbaijan uses

393
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,560
Pegasus

394
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,700
um

395
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,980
but we're not really sure it's also not

396
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,560
quite relevant nor is it relevant

397
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,700
whether

398
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,440
maybe somebody's images or recordings

399
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,240
were manipulated like that in this case

400
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,380
you don't even want to ask that question

401
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,899
but that's uh very damaging and it's

402
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,760
also an example why

403
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,680
uh this work is

404
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,019
is probably even harder for now it's

405
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,160
definitely even harder for women another

406
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,320
marginalized Clips there's a good report

407
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,320
by occrp on this particular case from a

408
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,300
few weeks ago

409
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,100
um it's also good to keep in mind that

410
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,560
you know as you know digital threats are

411
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,420
digital they don't really care about

412
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,639
borders

413
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,500
many Civil Society members need to flee

414
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,940
their countries to live as refugees

415
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,399
often in in Western countries

416
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,560
um the targeting continues there are

417
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,660
many known actors and this list is

418
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,940
definitely not

419
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,279
exhaustive of government access that

420
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:35,399
Target the aspara community

421
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,260
um really good paper by citizen lab from

422
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,079
last year I think on the psychological

423
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,779
and emotional impact of

424
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:46,320
such such transnational repression in

425
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,820
this particular case of people who fled

426
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,240
to Canada

427
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,060
you've probably heard of mercenary

428
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,920
actors or hackers for hire these are

429
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,560
companies sometimes somewhat public

430
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,959
sometimes very well hidden that you can

431
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,018
just hire to to hack to do a malware

432
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,920
combined to basically to gather

433
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,839
information through this kind of means

434
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,660
and governments hire them a lot

435
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,940
sometimes private companies do too maybe

436
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,459
not directly but you know they hire

437
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,220
a consultancy firm who hires an another

438
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,839
consultancy firm who didn't hires the

439
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,440
mercenary actor some of them are very

440
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,300
low skilled

441
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,800
um script Kitty but that's often enough

442
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,959
but sometimes are also really Advanced

443
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,380
some of them are linked to cybercrime

444
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,079
um they might do also do cybercrime

445
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,579
um like financially motivated crime

446
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,079
someone I'm also very close to

447
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,279
governments

448
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,860
and it makes hacking and Inspire

449
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,000
um available

450
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,279
at any level to any any actor the

451
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,720
government doesn't need to have a team

452
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,279
of hackers it just needs to have enough

453
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,320
money and most governments

454
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,760
apparently have enough money for this

455
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,500
kind of thing and Civil Society is

456
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,160
commonly targeted by mercenary actors

457
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,980
some examples and this list is much much

458
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,839
longer than the five examples here

459
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,800
um

460
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,480
environmental activist groups were

461
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,880
targeted by dark base in a few years ago

462
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,260
that's an actor

463
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,820
I think it was all citizen lab who gave

464
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,079
them a name

465
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,180
um and there's some suspicion that's

466
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,579
Exxon the oil company was somewhat

467
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,139
responsible for it but probably not

468
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,839
directly and they also believe that the

469
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,519
actual mercenary

470
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,620
company that was hired is an Indian

471
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,899
company called belt rocks hacking team

472
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,820
is a very big name at least like a

473
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,500
decade ago there's an Italian company I

474
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,600
don't think they're still active

475
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,399
um they were selling their services to

476
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,320
governments around the world including

477
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,480
Mexican journalists Mexican journalists

478
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,820
are probably in this space the war is

479
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,339
targeted they're targeted a lot by a lot

480
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:47,100
of different things and they do they

481
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,560
also face a lot of Mexico is also

482
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,779
extremely bad when it comes to murders

483
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,339
of journalists so

484
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:54,899
huge respect for people doing that kind

485
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,519
of work there

486
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,860
um Togo country in Africa activists

487
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,720
there were targeted with the Do Not

488
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,279
spyware which is also linked to a

489
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,380
different Indian company

490
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,480
um a few years ago there was a lot of

491
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,880
attacks going on in Uzbekistan

492
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,520
it's fishing spyware I believe some of

493
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,780
them use even use zero days

494
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:17,400
and and of course Pegasus which I'll

495
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,859
talk about in a few seconds

496
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,359
but first I want to talk a little bit

497
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,359
about team

498
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,980
and it's not related to you

499
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,179
um

500
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,580
the important

501
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,559
was published the information on them

502
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:34,440
was published about two months ago or so

503
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,980
it is a very mysterious very shady and

504
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,100
very well hidden Israeli company that

505
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,539
basically sells services to governments

506
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:43,799
where they can say we can swing

507
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,900
elections for you

508
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,220
um because most government even if

509
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,360
they're not very Democratic they still

510
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,620
hold elections

511
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,179
um

512
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:52,980
and we don't really know what they do we

513
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,900
assume that they include hacking

514
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,100
accounts because there were some some

515
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,440
examples of that but it's really hard to

516
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,460
tell

517
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,400
what they do and and unfortunately the

518
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,260
reporting and also understandably but

519
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,120
unfortunately the reporting was based on

520
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,760
leaked marketing material like they

521
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,200
pretended to be potential customer and

522
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,480
they just reported what team was trying

523
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,260
to sell them and

524
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,059
of course they were probably overstating

525
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,340
their their abilities I mean I wouldn't

526
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,860
want to determine the ability of cyber

527
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,480
security products based on leaked

528
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,880
marketing materials from say RSA or

529
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,200
something like that like of course it's

530
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,299
going to be exaggerated

531
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:31,620
um so we really don't know much about

532
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,559
the ttps and what's actually possible

533
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,059
um and which

534
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,880
hacks account takeover a small word you

535
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,260
know I if you may have seen in the world

536
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,480
may actually be linked to this group

537
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,940
uh there is an interesting case study uh

538
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,760
published last month about a smear

539
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,360
campaign who a politician in Serbia that

540
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,340
is linked to this group but it's one of

541
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,020
the very few concrete cases that people

542
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,120
have linked to this group

543
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,059
all right let's talk about Pegasus

544
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,280
okay there's a embarrassing typo it's

545
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,380
the NSO group not NGO group I thought I

546
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,580
could call that typo um

547
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,660
NSO group is the company that everyone

548
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,820
loves to hate because they they got out

549
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,220
of the way of being evil there they're

550
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,140
based in Israel and there's a lot

551
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,940
written about them as a company I don't

552
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,500
want to go into that

553
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,299
um Pegasus is well known as being a book

554
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:22,919
written about it people have done I

555
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:25,140
think multiple podcast series on Pegasus

556
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,880
many articles I'm sure you've all heard

557
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,260
about it

558
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,880
um but just as a summary they use zero

559
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,059
day Zero click exploits on iPhones so a

560
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:34,620
fully packed iPhone where someone never

561
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,240
clicks on a link

562
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,880
it still can still be taken over

563
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,679
um people are going to click on links

564
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,240
anyway so that's probably not the most

565
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,640
relevant part here but if there's no

566
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,120
click there's also no Trace to the to

567
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,799
the Target to the victim so it's not

568
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,840
like oh yeah I got this weird SMS three

569
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,960
weeks ago or yeah I got this email or

570
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,700
suddenly I have to click OK and I just

571
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,919
clicked okay to click it away there's no

572
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,960
Trace in that memory even

573
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,360
um we assume they target other devices I

574
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,500
think there was a pegasus for Android

575
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,240
like six seven years ago the people have

576
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,640
analyzed but talked much since it would

577
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,500
make sense to Target other devices but

578
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,660
Android is

579
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,700
um a lot harder to analyze and it's a

580
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,039
very more complex ecosystem

581
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:17,700
um

582
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,380
Civil Society is targeted around the

583
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,559
world a lot so badly in so many ways in

584
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,919
so many places that any kind of

585
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:28,140
uh denial from NSO that they are aware

586
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,299
of this is just ridiculous and it's

587
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:33,179
really hard to defend against like

588
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:36,000
there's nothing you can say I know Apple

589
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,140
has done

590
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:37,860
um

591
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,380
it's added lockdown mode to iOS which

592
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,960
definitely mitigates things but yeah we

593
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,340
don't know what new exploits they're

594
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,860
finding or that maybe bypass

595
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,539
lockdown mode and

596
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,860
what I just want to want to share

597
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,299
because that's maybe something you don't

598
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,280
know that or don't realize is how

599
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,799
extremely traumatizing Pegasus or even a

600
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,500
suspicion of Pegasus can be

601
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,919
um I know about the journalist who uh

602
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,140
Got a notification from from Apple uh

603
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,700
that there was a suspicion at a phone

604
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,400
checked practices was confirmed

605
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,539
um on the one hand he thought yeah this

606
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,039
is a big story of me being targeted it's

607
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,500
a big story but also if I go public in

608
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,780
any kind of way no Source will ever want

609
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,919
to talk to me

610
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:18,840
and that's basically the end of our

611
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,760
career or at least that's what she

612
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,780
thought

613
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,179
um I've I know people who were targeted

614
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:25,980
with Pegasus uh who suddenly started

615
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,940
worrying about their family they were

616
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,000
like yeah okay I decided to become an

617
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,740
activist or journalist I take this risk

618
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,640
but

619
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,860
does that mean that my family is also

620
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,360
talking to that do I have to warn them

621
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,400
what should they do

622
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,380
um and get error cases where Pegasus was

623
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,440
used to Target a family member of of the

624
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,659
person they were actually interested in

625
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:47,100
um there's been some some very good

626
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,880
reporting on the traumatic impact of

627
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,860
Pegasus and if you're interested yeah

628
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,740
look for these articles

629
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,539
um if your board of packages so much

630
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:01,380
there's a new company to hate quad rims

631
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,240
there's a report the citizen lab

632
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,039
published yesterday and Microsoft also

633
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,640
published a bell or report

634
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,720
um

635
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,460
aquarium is also an Israeli company

636
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,179
doing very similar things to to NSO and

637
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:16,080
um

638
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,720
it has also a Cyprus link there

639
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,880
um but yes NSO and Pegasus are not the

640
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,500
only ones out there

641
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,559
um

642
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,700
so

643
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,500
what does incident response look like

644
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,299
for this community I mean many of you

645
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:33,120
probably involved in this response well

646
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,159
it's complex and it's hard

647
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:36,600
um I I'm not talking about trivialize

648
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,220
impotent response in an Enterprise but

649
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,480
there are definitely ways in which it's

650
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,460
different and possibly harder firstly

651
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,960
there's often very limited Telemetry

652
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,640
analogs like the the kind of products

653
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,140
the kind of settings that you use

654
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,039
they're not available

655
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,440
um Telemetry is also when it's it's

656
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,539
available in like antivirus it's often

657
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:59,820
turned off because trust and that's sort

658
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,440
of understandable

659
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,020
um limited Telemetry also means that we

660
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,360
don't always find out about threat I

661
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,260
mean good quote-unquote good spyware

662
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,600
hides from the user so you only find out

663
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,240
when there's some consequence of it like

664
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,760
I know of cases where someone's

665
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,340
YouTube account was taken over through

666
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,500
session hijacking and that's what led to

667
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,700
an investigation of what's happening on

668
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,620
the device and oh that was a key logo

669
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,620
they'd never realized

670
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,900
um EDR and MDR are hard to do in a

671
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,919
sustainable way it takes a little bit of

672
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,179
Manpower and therefore a lot of money

673
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:36,299
and it's not the sort of thing uh it's

674
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:37,860
hard to get funding for that than if you

675
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,659
get funding it's like temporary and it's

676
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,039
it's not the sort of thing that you just

677
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,380
want to turn off at some point so it's

678
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,200
really hard to do EDR MDR

679
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,700
um and that's also

680
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,340
understandable trust issues

681
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,500
um also my experience is that most

682
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,360
targets they just want to move on like

683
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,880
get my device clean get my account back

684
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,860
Etc and then move on

685
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,360
um if you do instead of response at that

686
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,000
Enterprise and you get some someone has

687
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,340
an infected laptop it's your job to get

688
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,740
that laptop and look at it they it's

689
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,240
their job they say yes here's my laptop

690
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,559
but that's not the kind of relationship

691
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,620
you have with with the journalists

692
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,240
um and that's drama I mentioned trauma

693
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,260
before

694
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,380
um drama often leads to extreme distrust

695
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,700
like I know people that were

696
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,080
trying to help say some journalists but

697
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,280
they were not like oh no no I'm not

698
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,960
going to give you my my device I don't

699
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,159
trust you why would I trust you

700
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:30,900
understandable but yeah you need to do

701
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,419
something if you want to investigate

702
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,400
um I've also seen surprisingly many

703
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,200
cases of extreme Trust

704
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,700
where people are like oh my passwords

705
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,320
here's my device please do whatever you

706
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,760
need to do which is also

707
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,460
which is great from

708
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,380
for from a workflow point of view but

709
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,720
it's also not very advisable

710
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,539
um hyper vigilance or you know paranoia

711
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,340
is extremely common

712
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,380
also very understandable but it means

713
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,240
that any kind of malfunctioning device

714
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,039
people assume that it's that it's a

715
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,780
threat that it's an attack and not just

716
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,000
like a phone getting old or an app being

717
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,440
slightly buggy

718
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,539
and there's and I don't mean this any

719
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,419
judgmental way but trauma makes people

720
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:10,559
unreliable narrators I mean it's hard

721
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,480
enough from someone who is not

722
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,360
an expert on digital security to ask

723
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,559
them like what really happened to your

724
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,900
device when but

725
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,140
I've seen people

726
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,340
um

727
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,419
misremember certain events

728
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:29,340
for example one thing I remember once

729
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,900
something that turned out to happen like

730
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,640
once every six months doesn't matter

731
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,960
what it was it was like okay that's

732
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,000
that's normal but they felt like what's

733
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,980
happening a lot

734
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,140
um and that's really hard to if you

735
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,360
interview someone to try and figure out

736
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,440
what

737
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,320
what really happened it's really hard to

738
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,700
actually build a picture and try to

739
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,720
understand what what happened

740
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,679
finally

741
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:53,820
um

742
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,460
hopefully you you sit here thinking like

743
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,440
hey that's that's really cool that's

744
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,360
important work care about Civil Society

745
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,740
you don't just care about France or

746
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,000
whatever country you're from you think

747
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,279
is important all around the world and

748
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,020
you think that these are serious threats

749
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,720
and and um you want to help that's cool

750
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,059
so how can you help well

751
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,279
I know many of you are like more reverse

752
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,360
engineers

753
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,340
it's cool I've had people offer this

754
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,020
like oh we can revert engineered that's

755
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,360
cool it's not really what's in what's

756
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,039
needed like it's

757
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,020
it's extremely rare that I've been in a

758
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,700
case where

759
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,140
firstly there was more over involved and

760
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,159
secondly

761
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:30,539
to the level that you really needed to

762
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,400
reverse engineer that running it in a

763
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,539
sandbox didn't give you the information

764
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,940
that you needed to just protect the

765
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,860
community I talked about Mustang Panda

766
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,600
before

767
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,559
um

768
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,179
it was enough for me to run the assemble

769
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:43,320
in the sandbox to determine it was

770
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,820
Muslim Panda and I know from public

771
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,220
reports what I was doing so technical

772
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,080
answers that I needed to know about what

773
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,880
the more I was doing

774
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,539
um

775
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,760
I got them all from uh from reverse

776
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,140
engineering

777
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,159
um

778
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,860
if you can share threats if if you are

779
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,120
researching threats and many of you are

780
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,799
doing that and you notice it's affecting

781
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,480
some of these communities

782
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,240
um if you can share it that's great if

783
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,860
you can build connections maybe they can

784
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,419
tell you what they see that's even

785
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,799
greater

786
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,760
um iocs are rarely relevant because

787
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,860
very few organizations that not just

788
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,080
through in Civil Society can do anything

789
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,779
with like an IP address or something

790
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:22,919
dtps are more helpful because you can

791
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:24,720
build a story from them like hey this is

792
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,580
what's happening

793
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,440
um if you have licenses but product

794
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,120
platform licenses

795
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,260
like

796
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,020
uh threat Intel platforms yeah talk to

797
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,400
me because I'd love to hand them out to

798
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,419
other people

799
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:37,980
um if you do trainings

800
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,460
maybe some threat in though basic

801
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,900
training or something like that and you

802
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,880
have some extra seat that you want to

803
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,880
give away for free um talk to me

804
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,799
um working together on Research okay

805
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,960
maybe you say hey I want to write a

806
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,520
research report on some more right

807
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,080
that's targeting

808
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,260
a journalist in country X maybe you can

809
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,299
work with organization in that country

810
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:03,120
um happy to talk to you if you don't

811
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,700
know where who to talk to um

812
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,080
and I mentioned funding and I don't

813
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,640
mention funding just like hey if you

814
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,679
have money please give it to not just to

815
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:12,419
me no not to me but to these

816
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:14,220
organizations but actually you know keep

817
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,539
in mind that these organizations are

818
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,039
extremely underfunded

819
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,960
and so if you want to work together on

820
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,880
Research have that conversation saying

821
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,720
hey

822
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,460
maybe you need to pay them for their

823
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,840
work working together on the research

824
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,820
think about that

825
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,460
same with threat sharing like if they're

826
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,320
gonna provide information on what they

827
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,340
see

828
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,140
yeah please consider that they shouldn't

829
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,299
be doing that for free

830
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:36,960
um

831
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,460
that's it this will be about five

832
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,900
minutes four questions

833
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,440
thank you

834
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,620
[Applause]

835
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,840
yeah actually less than five minutes so

836
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,120
make them quick oh the boss

837
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,000
thank you very much for the presentation

838
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,340
I just had a question with us with

839
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,159
regards like uh if all cell phones get

840
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,679
hacked then do educate journalists to

841
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,120
use cubes or something like that would

842
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,200
that help

843
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,080
or it's too slow for them to communicate

844
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,880
um Cube so cubes is an operating system

845
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,799
that is kind of you know everything runs

846
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,020
as virtual machines it's super secure I

847
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:24,000
I like it I like the work on it I

848
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,460
I know people who work on it I'm

849
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,200
generally reluctant to recommend certain

850
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,940
tools because

851
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,760
it needs a certain experience to do

852
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,039
tools and not to make mistakes and

853
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,039
sometimes mistakes can be very costly

854
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,220
um

855
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,020
but also I don't know enough like people

856
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,640
have not done enough research like how

857
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,620
those two cubes work in in this

858
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,120
community like most people work on it

859
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,059
they're from Western countries they

860
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:53,279
have the capacity to to research to to

861
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,600
work on that

862
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,860
um I'm very curious if someone has

863
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,299
actually done that that work in that

864
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:00,080
research but yeah

865
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,679
no more questions

866
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,419
I'll be I'll be around I mean I'd love

867
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,340

868
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,980

869
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,539

870
