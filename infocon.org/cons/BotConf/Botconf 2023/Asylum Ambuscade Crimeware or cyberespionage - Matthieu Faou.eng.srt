1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,240
and thanks to the organizing Community

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,700
for organizing again this nice but

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,760
conference

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,620
today I'm going to talk about a group

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,400
that is named Asylum and biscade what is

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,680
interesting with this group is that it's

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,720
at the border between cybercrime and

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,619
cyber spinach which is quite rare

9
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,199
before starting quick presentation of

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,019
myself I've been a Marvel researcher at

11
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,800
ESET since 2016 and I mostly do reverse

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,780
engineering and tracking of ipt groups

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,579
first I'd like to give some context

14
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,760
about our interests around either on my

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,980
biscade as you probably know is that has

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,379
been has dedicated a lot of effort in

17
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,559
the past 10 years even more last year

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,660
into analyzing and controlling threats

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,180
in Ukraine

20
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,879
um and for example last year we found

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,280
many wiper companies and also new

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,320
version of industrial which is a piece

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,359
of malware I'm at disrupting the power

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,979
grid

25
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,799
and so during this last year we

26
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,380
regularly like people or in the media

27
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,240
for example saying that Russian cyber

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,720
criminals are targeting Ukraine and its

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,340
allies

30
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,700
but is it really true and are there

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,920
really engaged in this whole effort and

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,840
that's why I'd like to

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,659
show this example today

34
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,080
um so for example I I took an example in

35
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,619
Radio Canada because it's where it's

36
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,799
from where I live and last year in some

37
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,420
articles they were talking about a

38
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,360
Russian group who targeted aluminum

39
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,799
smelter

40
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,600
and it was published in March 2022.

41
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,740
and we have a first code

42
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,740
by Alexis we should be somewhere in in

43
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,479
the room we think that there are just

44
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,700
cyber criminals and their goal is just

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,880
to make money it's it's really simple

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,820
but then we can scroll down more in the

47
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,880
article and we have like a next Canadian

48
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,340
Security event service it's always those

49
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,160
kind of guys who are quoted in a news

50
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,640
article and is saying that the attack is

51
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,379
a direct support given to Russian

52
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,780
President Vladimir Putin and is invasion

53
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,780
of Ukraine so as a remember reminder it

54
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,120
was just some ransomware event at an

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,959
aluminum's murder somewhere in Quebec

56
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,420
um so with this kind of odd text it's

57
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,760
not like surprising that everyone in the

58
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,520
public is very confused about what is

59
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,780
going on and what's the difference

60
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,879
between cyber crime and cyber spinach

61
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,540
um so let's take let's take a step back

62
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,340
and look at the Russian language groups

63
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,860
that are involving Ukraine and the

64
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,280
region last year

65
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,680
we have a first cluster of group with

66
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,220
syndrome send it and sunbear and they

67
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,080
have mostly been reasonable for

68
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,239
disruptive events the so-called wipers

69
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,640
so for example the aromatic wiper

70
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,860
campaigned by soundworm or the whisper

71
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,200
gate

72
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,720
fake run somewhere by somewhere

73
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,879
and they are mostly targeting like

74
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,560
cooking and government and energy

75
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,659
infrastructure

76
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,239
then we have a second cluster with

77
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,180
zodiak's invisible gamma Rhoden and

78
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,239
Kalisto they do only cyber Springs

79
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,700
against high value targets their goal is

80
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,819
to steal confidential information they

81
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,860
don't do like destruction because their

82
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,260
goal is to stay in the network for as

83
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,400
much time as possible to like still

84
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,920
fresh information all the time

85
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,379
and then we have this third cluster

86
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,180
which will really call the Cyber

87
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,000
criminals and it includes among others

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,220
like it's not exhaustive killnet

89
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,700
bootstrap conti and of course azarm and

90
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,840
biscuits

91
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,080
so this make a nice transition to to the

92
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,440
torque and so the group was actually

93
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,959
discovered by proof Bank last year the

94
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,299
the published this blog post in March

95
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,879
2022.

96
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,798
uh researchers at proofpoint say that

97
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,839
the group condition is fishing campaign

98
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,600
against the staff of European government

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,940
involved in the Arab uh toward

100
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,940
Refugee and

101
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,759
yeah and at that time the like the war

102
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,160
I've been running for about a week

103
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,560
and they give more details say that's an

104
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,560
attachment with the malicious macros and

105
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,699
that don't even matter where

106
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,919
similarities called Sun seeds and it's

107
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,000
developing Lua

108
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,639
according to our visibility most high

109
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,400
profile targets were located in Eastern

110
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,940
Europe mostly around ukraines and we

111
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,500
noticed that the group was especially

112
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,960
interesting in diplomats and people

113
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,820
working at ministries of Foreign Affairs

114
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,220
so now let's see what's the infection

115
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,040
chain uh it starts with malicious

116
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,100
documents so these are few examples most

117
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,600
of the time they use my issues document

118
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,259
with with VBA micro but at some point

119
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,120
they also started to use the foreign

120
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,639
vulnerability

121
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,180
and so the malicious documents are

122
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,780
attached to spearfishing emails

123
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,100
most of the time the malicious document

124
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,060
is excelled as a document with a VBA

125
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,520
macro that will download the MSI in

126
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,160
Stereo from from a CNC server

127
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,419
and this MSI installer will download the

128
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,060
sunset downloader which is downloader in

129
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,940
Lua and the president is established by

130
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,639
dropping lnk file in the startup folder

131
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,060
so nothing very

132
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,620
complex

133
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,320
but this is just the start of the chain

134
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,780
and then this Sunset downloader can

135
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,820
actually download additional plugins

136
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,860
and one of them will install another

137
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,860
downloader which is actually like some

138
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,680
seeds but in automotive key it's called

139
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,060
ahk Bots it's really same thing as

140
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,220
a sunset but instead of fluids in

141
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,539
automotive key

142
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,819
and what's different for this one is

143
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,160
they have like real spying plugins so

144
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,479
for example there wants to take

145
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,639
screenshots or to steal passwords

146
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,660
so this is what uh Sun City looks like

147
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,160
it's a somehow obfuscated uh but after a

148
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,139
bit of manual work it's possible to

149
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,919
recover some rear episode and basically

150
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,560
it will take the serial number of the

151
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,500
sea Drive of the infected machine then

152
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,319
send the HTTP get request to earth-coded

153
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,000
CNG server

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,660
um

155
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,840
this group almost never use domain name

156
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,139
so in order malware it's directly the IP

157
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,419
address which is arcoded and then the

158
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,759
get request is just slash the serial

159
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,740
number that was

160
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,440
um

161
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,060
which we've just before

162
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,020
then the reply is either a new or

163
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,160
um

164
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,440
record which will be directly

165
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,639
interpreted

166
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,800
so it's actually like we don't know the

167
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,599
right download

168
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,380
interpret it in memory

169
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,380
so this is an example of uh the plugin

170
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,900
that is responsible to for installing

171
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,139
the next stage so it will download the

172
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,440
mscore e.hk which is like the HK but

173
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,620
scripts and also the msql e.exe which is

174
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,180
the auto key interpreter

175
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,300
as you may have noticed this group

176
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,120
really likes scripting languages so they

177
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,919
have started to to develop the same

178
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,639
thing in many other languages so for

179
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,880
example there are instead of Lua there

180
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,240
is a second stage in TCL but it's

181
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,639
actually the same thing except in I

182
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,280
think in this specific example yes I did

183
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,020
not retrieve the C drive seven number

184
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,419
but it will look the same probably the

185
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:22,520
same person

186
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,560
just redevelop something in a different

187
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,800
language

188
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,020
and this is what hkbot is

189
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,599
again it's it's the same thing but in

190
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,539
another scripting language so it was a C

191
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,760
drive server number and then that's HTTP

192
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,700
get request to the AP slash the serial

193
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,880
number

194
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,760
this is an example of plugins that is

195
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,779
downloaded by ahk bot so this one is

196
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:54,180
called Road server on by by the

197
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,080
developer and it will download a radical

198
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,140
remote utilities it's more or less like

199
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,260
a legitimate route

200
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,820
like there is a official website and you

201
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,860
can you can download it

202
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,980
and yeah it will like download download

203
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,080
it and install it on the victim machine

204
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,260
so then attackers have uh have direct

205
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,959
access to the machine

206
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,959
there are many more plugins uh yeah the

207
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,180
list is quite long

208
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,140
um a few interesting ones are the screen

209
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,240
which will take screenshots of the

210
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,980
victim machine the hvnc once so it's not

211
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,420
really a real item VNC it's actually a

212
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,880
headless Chrome instance that can be

213
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,120
controlled remotely

214
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,820
um I'm not exactly sure what's what the

215
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,980
purpose of it but it might be to enable

216
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,200
attackers to to broaden internal

217
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,700
websites that will not be accessible

218
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,779
from

219
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,279
like the outside Network

220
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,140
then there is a browser password stealer

221
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,860
the root server uh plugins that I just

222
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,480
shown before

223
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,040
and

224
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,560
the delete cookie was one is really

225
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,380
interesting because when I first analyze

226
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,399
it I noticed that so this

227
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,640
plugin will delete cookies on the

228
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,300
infected machine for very specific

229
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,279
domains so delete cookies in the in the

230
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,620
browsers and you will delete cookies

231
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,760
from may.ru and tg.com and td.com is one

232
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,000
of the biggest bank in Canada

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,720
so it's probably really unrelated to uh

234
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,480
to cyber cyber Espionage but most likely

235
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,420
to to Sable crime so it started to be to

236
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,339
be interesting

237
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,800
um I'm not really sure what the final

238
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,899
purpose of delete cookies but it might

239
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,220
be easier for the attacker to hide

240
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,720
tracism the infecting machine if they

241
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,480
connect it to uh to one of of the bank

242
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,720
or my account or it can be to force the

243
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,079
victim to reconnect to their uh to their

244
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:10,440
account so so that using

245
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,360
for example the key logger or the

246
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,519
password series they can steal their

247
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,760
password

248
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,820
so from this discovery I started to to

249
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,060
check uh if I can find like earlier

250
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,880
reference of of this tool set

251
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,940
and I found this train macro article

252
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,579
from from 2020

253
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:33,360
um

254
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,860
but described the credential

255
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,019
stereotergic in U.S and Canadian buying

256
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,399
customers

257
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,160
and if we scroll down a little bit we

258
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,899
can see this nice overview of the

259
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,940
infection chain

260
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,880
it starts with a Excel file with many

261
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,459
shoes macro

262
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:54,680
then it drops an automatic downloader

263
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,180
that can download additional scripts

264
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,600
from the CNG server it's quite familiar

265
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,579
I guess

266
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:05,459
and if we scroll down again we can find

267
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:08,100
an example of a of a plugin which is the

268
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,500
password server and we can compare it to

269
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,660
current version of the their password

270
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,300
stealer and actually it's exactly the

271
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,040
same

272
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,339
so the tools I choose

273
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,740
um in the Cyber climate campaign

274
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,899
described by Trend Micro and the tool

275
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:28,079
set used by xylem and biscade is like

276
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,180
exactly the same so it's it's a good

277
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,620
link

278
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,560
between the best events

279
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,560
so is it an example of cyber crime group

280
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,779
that switched to espionage at the

281
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,940
beginning at the beginning of the war so

282
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,700
is it like how example of a group that

283
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,300
will really like support the war in

284
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,339
Ukraine

285
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,820
actually not because since uh 2020 they

286
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,500
have been targeting government officials

287
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,959
and people working instead on companies

288
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:02,100
in Central Asia in and in Armenia and we

289
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,279
think that the group is active even on

290
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,860
the cyber crime perhaps since early 2020

291
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,680
so it will mean that yeah the group is

292
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,839
doing cyber crime and cyber Spinners in

293
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,079
the beginning

294
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:20,399
yeah so it's it's not true and they've

295
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,000
been doing both

296
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,680
speaking of cyber crime since October

297
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,620
2022 we noticed that there was a big

298
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,959
increase of their campaign and they have

299
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,880
been targeting like a lot of people in

300
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,920
the last months

301
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,360
um

302
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,360
it's it's a map of the victim as you can

303
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,279
see most of the victim are located in

304
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,740
Canada and the US but we have also

305
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,680
victims like everywhere

306
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,399
um in Europe South America even few in

307
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,440
Asia and also in Russia

308
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,360
um we counted more than 4 500 victims

309
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,139
since January 2022 so they're mostly

310
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,060
victims for the cyber crime companies

311
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,200
cyber spinach uh victims are like uh

312
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,459
really just just a few

313
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,740
and there are big spikes of like in the

314
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,360
last month there have been big spice of

315
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,000
infection almost every month so at the

316
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,100
end of November December

317
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,980
uh mid-January and beginning of March

318
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,100
so now how do they infect their victims

319
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,860
for cyber climate campaigns they must

320
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,079
like the most of the time use the

321
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,260
traffic direction system to redirect

322
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,079
targets to the malicious Pages

323
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:44,519
um

324
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,339
in our Telemetry we did not observe how

325
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:49,079
people landed on the first node of the

326
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:52,139
TDS but open source reporting such as

327
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,000
that attackers are sending spearfishing

328
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,399
email with links or spearfishing image

329
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,639
with PDF attached that contain links to

330
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,800
the first node of the TDS

331
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,339
it's also possible that visitors from

332
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,199
compromise websites are donating to the

333
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,899
TDS because in most cases we didn't

334
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:14,100
observe any email or PDF

335
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,920
so this is an example I found on

336
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,620
urscan.io offer redirection using like

337
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,399
the TDS that the Roman biscuit is using

338
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,000
so first we have like a first URL on

339
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,180
local kitchencodes.com then there is a

340
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,260
row direction to

341
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,120
stream.com

342
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,079
and finally the the last URL which is on

343
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,459
the tech4solution.com and this last

344
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:47,760
domain will deliver a Javascript file

345
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,980
like a JavaScript downloader

346
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,779
and this is the name of of the

347
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,360
downloader the format is most of them

348
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,699
the same it's a document then a date

349
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,860
it's a date of the content and then a

350
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,740
random number.js

351
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,660
and there are like dozens of those

352
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,660
chains with different domains all the

353
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,839
time so the network infrastructure they

354
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,720
are using is quite large

355
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,420
and sometimes users are also regulating

356
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,019
to fake Zoom Pages or fake TeamViewer

357
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,320
pages but the the payload is the same

358
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,120
it's always a man issues JavaScript

359
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,720
downloader

360
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,940
um

361
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,880
but what is interesting is the TDS

362
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,579
doesn't seem exclusive to to as a normal

363
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,860
biscuit so it seems that other groups

364
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,079
other cyber criminal groups are also

365
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,300
using the same redirection mechanism to

366
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,579
redirect people to like to their

367
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,920
malicious

368
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,100
um malware so for example we have like

369
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,339
this chain which is like chain of Asylum

370
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,680
Biscuit the last node of the TDS was a

371
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,680
nakoda machine.com uh we have this

372
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,320
document uh first December blah blah

373
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,540
blah.gs and finally on the victim

374
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,640
machine we observe that the next stages

375
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,220
was HK but

376
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,640
then if we look on varistotle for this

377
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,819
domain we can see that another MSI

378
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,679
package was downloaded from from this

379
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,400
domain and this MSI package will drop a

380
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,980
partial downloader which will then

381
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,699
download the stereo from from a group

382
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:29,000
and it

383
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,400
the poor shell will download a stereo

384
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,059
from a domain which is download cdn.com

385
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,480
this domain was used by

386
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,940
ta505 in 2020 of course the ownerships

387
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,120
probably changed but for sure it's not

388
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,600
part of any asylum on the scale chain so

389
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,760
it means that other cyber crime groups

390
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,100
are also leveraging the same TDS to

391
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,178
distribute their payloads

392
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,360
and we also observe

393
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,700
a few infection things that looks like

394
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,700
cubot so I'm not really expert in all

395
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,700
cyber crime groups but for sure like

396
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,039
this TDs is used by other protectors so

397
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,340
it's probably a pay underground services

398
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:17,220
that Asylum biscuit is using to to have

399
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,140
to have installations of the MRI

400
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,280
um we didn't observe that but on on the

401
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,900
internet I found that few people

402
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,000
reported that there was a Google ads

403
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,340
manages Google ads to uh to the

404
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,900
malicious website especially the

405
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,840
TeamViewer and zoom fake page that I

406
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,960
shown earlier so there is a blog post

407
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,380
blog post by sense uh about that and you

408
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,840
can see like this

409
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,640
manifest ads which will then redirect to

410
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,520
to the effect TeamViewer page

411
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,480
foreign

412
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,580
so now let's take a look at the

413
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,260
malicious JavaScript

414
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,299
so it's it's obfuscated but the final

415
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,220
goal is just to to download an MSI

416
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,260
package and I think that all the first

417
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,940
Parts uh except that till the MSI is is

418
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,039
operated by by some group which operates

419
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,039
the TDS and then the MSI and what's

420
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,320
comes after is operated by by another

421
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,919
group in this case a xylon biscuit

422
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,220
if the target executed the jscript you

423
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,860
do not so the MSI package will drop this

424
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,020
VBS downloader which is again like

425
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:33,000
sunseed or fkbot but in VBS and this can

426
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,160
download additional MSI packages

427
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,460
packages include packages will drop HK

428
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,039
Bots also a new python switch motor and

429
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,860
in this campaign You observe a new hkbar

430
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,900
plugins

431
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,360
since the python squid shooter it's

432
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,260
quite simple but as usual the code feels

433
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,280
like it's the same person who develop

434
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,000
all of all of those tools

435
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,880
another one is hcmd which is a reversion

436
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,020
in not.js it has replaced Ash VNC which

437
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,240
was like the atlas from my I told

438
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,419
earlier

439
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:17,000
and yeah the goal is just to spawn the

440
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,740
cmd.exe and execute command and send the

441
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,280
result back

442
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,520
there is also a new password steer and

443
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,620
what is funny is there is a common

444
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,539
Innovation that say here here it is

445
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:33,360
known as the function should return so I

446
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,280
guess I don't really know what they are

447
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,960
doing it's a bit reassuring

448
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,240
um

449
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,860
script to get information about the

450
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,140
active directory from producing net

451
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,799
group function and also an L test and

452
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,380
system info

453
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,559
and of course the final stage is a cobal

454
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:59,580
strike and we didn't observe what comes

455
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,000
after it's likely that Asylum biscuit is

456
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,520
resealing this installation to for

457
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,960
example run some more operators

458
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,480
this is a cobal swag config

459
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,400
what's interesting is that they use the

460
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,640
jQuery malleable profile and also we can

461
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,020
check the watermark is a it's a norm

462
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,419
Watermark that is used by many cyber

463
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,160
coin groups so I guess it's a leak cover

464
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,679
swag Builder that is available somewhere

465
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,720
on the internet

466
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,020
foreign

467
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:44,640
is always the same when detections are

468
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,580
when they're malware a bit too much

469
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,059
detected the the redevelop it in another

470
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,860
scripting language to decrease the

471
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,840
detection ratio

472
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,620
so this is the main back door so as you

473
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,120
can see it will again take the serial

474
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,820
number of the C drive and then does http

475
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,640
get request to the CNC server

476
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,679
they also started to redevelop some of

477
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,760
the plugins so for example this one is a

478
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,520
web web browser password stealer

479
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,600
um and it targets few few browsers

480
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,659
and or the screen photo which relies on

481
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:28,140
external tool called earphone view to

482
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,679
take the screenshots so as of now not

483
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,039
all plugins were ported to uh to node.js

484
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,880
but I think they are working on it

485
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,159
and

486
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,159
also in merger starting to play with the

487
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,100
lnk file which was very trendy and among

488
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,880
all or almost all three Textures in 2022

489
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,039
and they were also playing with a DOT

490
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,400
pip file which are Microsoft Publisher

491
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,419
files and as other office files it

492
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:03,539
it's possible to to put VBA macro in

493
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,720
them

494
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,440
this is an example of a test of ethereum

495
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,299
on biscated operator on various daughter

496
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:15,240
which tried to uh to bypass one static

497
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,580
detection in China on various total so

498
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,260
as you can see it was quite quick

499
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,960
because in 26 minutes they were able to

500
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,780
to bypass static detections but at some

501
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,600
point they successfully increased to uh

502
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,178
to five or four detections

503
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,539
um quick note about attribution I

504
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,880
mentioned the first proofpoint blog post

505
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,400
but there was another one published in

506
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,039
February it's about the cybercrombie

507
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:48,000
part and the track it at ta866

508
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,179
um so now the question is

509
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,740
um are the explanation cybercrime

510
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,640
cluster the same group or is HK but my

511
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,919
work it for sale or the marowaso service

512
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,320
platform

513
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,120
so first there is low level of activity

514
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,720
I said that there was 4 500 victims so

515
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,780
if the malware was widely Sherman may

516
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,120
need to attack her I expect to see way

517
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,620
more victims

518
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,840
second Network infrastructure is very

519
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,940
similar servers are configured the same

520
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,740
way as they are hosted on same hosting

521
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,419
providers Etc

522
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:29,840
and also

523
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,080
are quite basic and you can buy way more

524
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,360
sophisticated toolkit so

525
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,020
uh I'm not convinced that it's people

526
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,158
were really bad

527
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,419
um so our assessment is it's a cyber

528
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,760
crime group that is doing Espionage on

529
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,020
the side

530
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,419
um it's not clear what link they have to

531
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,179
any like security service but

532
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,159
if they are targeting diplomats around

533
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,360
Ukraine it means that they know to to um

534
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,799
like fit the data

535
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,460
um yeah we have two hypothesis for like

536
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,380
the sub broken part it can be easier to

537
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,179
form the Espionage operation or for

538
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,220
personal profits but Espionage

539
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,440
operations are really a little part of

540
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,720
the activity of the group so as I said

541
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,059
it's more likely there are criminals

542
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:23,400
like cyber crime part is for the

543
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,440
personal profit and they do Espionage on

544
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,679
the side

545
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,940
and now quick information about like the

546
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,340
possible origin of the attackers already

547
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,360
shown like few like comments in Russians

548
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,580
but there are more for example this one

549
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,039
says my number for debugging and it's

550
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,919
likely the C drive several numbers of

551
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:49,200
the developer of the malware

552
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,880
and

553
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,539
if you remember the targets of Espionage

554
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:56,880
operation were first government entities

555
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,740
in Central Asia since the beginning of

556
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,140
the activity of the group and then the

557
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,960
recently switched to Eastern Europe and

558
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,559
neighbors of of Ukraine so

559
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,900
it suggests that attackers somehow

560
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,039
connected to to Belarus or Russia

561
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:17,340
so let's conclude this talk

562
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,860
um as you know on biscuit is doing both

563
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,900
cybercromb and cyber spinach but we

564
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,179
believe there are cyber criminals uh

565
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:27,779
doing a few cyber spinach operations

566
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,120
they have basic tool sets but they tweak

567
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,100
it all the time they will redevelop the

568
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,900
same thing in other scripting languages

569
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,159
to bypass antivirus detections

570
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:40,620
and finally We Believe with medium

571
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,299
confidence that the group is along with

572
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:45,980
Russian operation interests

573
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,620
um I think we have a few minutes left so

574
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,960
feel free to ask questions

575
00:26:51,960 --> 00:27:01,819
[Applause]

576
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,919
could it be some state

577
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:19,200
employee that try to get some money

578
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,000
outside of their daily job

579
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,039
yeah it's possible but if he was

580
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,559
Employee of some security service he

581
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,360
will already have access to some

582
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,700
Advanced toolkit to do their

583
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,919
Espionage operations

584
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,760
um sees razor unusual toolkit for for

585
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,299
Espionage it's really like

586
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:46,340
cyber form like toolkit

587
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:52,760
any other question

588
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:57,200
okay last question

589
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,640
thank you for our presentation have you

590
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,679
observes the same behavior from other

591
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,740
classic civil super criminal group doing

592
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,960
a little bit of springage on the side

593
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,440
during the Ukrainian War

594
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,740
yeah uh I I forgot to talk about it in

595
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,840
in the conclusion but no I think it's

596
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,440
one of the all the only example of cyber

597
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,539
crime group that is really doing like

598
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:27,960
targeted attack for a spinach purpose

599
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,020
um I feel that we didn't observe any

600
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,340
other group doing the same thing

601
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,380
okay thank you very much

602
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,130
thank you

603
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:43,449
[Applause]
