1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,220
so in our selection of talks actually uh

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,740
Paul is a keynote speaker so he

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,000
submitted

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,980
and uh I decided as a as chair of the

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,440
program committee to uh

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,660
to select his talk

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,500
um which is slightly a bit of topic from

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,140
uh budkov

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,400
because he's going to talk about a

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,720
specific transport protocol

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:31,980
um

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,059
but actually we uh we thought it would

13
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:37,739
be interesting to to have this talk

14
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,239
about

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,520
the the this protocol that has has been

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,320
uh uh worked on since 2013 I guess

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,840
and is starting to to have a

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,899
applications rfcs and so on since a

19
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,780
couple years ago and so and it might

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,879
have a number of security implications

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,219
and maybe you can discuss with Paul

22
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,280
about the uh the use by the the bad guys

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,559
of uh of that protocol

24
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,240
so you have the floor you can take your

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,420
mic

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,560
hello

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,960
close okay

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,600
uh good afternoon thank you for having

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,299
me back it's been a few years since I

30
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,460
was at about conf I really enjoyed it

31
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,759
and I'm meeting some new people and some

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,400
old friends this is uh quite an honor I

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,259
appreciate it

34
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,380
um let me say the work I'm going to

35
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,479
describe

36
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,400
did not really come from Amazon I happen

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,500
to work at Amazon so that's the name on

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,540
the slides but it's safe to say they

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,200
don't know I'm here and that the company

40
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,060
does not have a position on this but I

41
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,180
do and my co-author Ben April stand up

42
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,079
briefly

43
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,020
the tall dude back there he and I worked

44
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,180
together at farsight security for quite

45
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,240
some years and this work sort of came

46
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,060
out of that time but you know it's not

47
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,740
intellectual property or anything so I

48
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,960
don't think the uh that that Corporation

49
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,479
really cares that I'm here either

50
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,200
um

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,739
so some of you may have seen earlier

52
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:13,800
evolutions of this material because it's

53
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,620
been a slow rolling

54
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,700
uh event for the internet industry and

55
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,680
um I apologize for anything that bores

56
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,239
you because you've seen it before but I

57
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,720
promise that this is uh has been

58
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,879
continually revised

59
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,480
um

60
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,239
so what's happening is that what people

61
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,480
used to use Tor for the onion router is

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,340
about to be the default transport

63
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,319
protocol characteristic of the internet

64
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,400
itself so the idea of end-to-end opacity

65
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,340
uh is something

66
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,440
devoutly to be wished for by a whole

67
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,959
bunch of people

68
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,180
those people generally speaking have

69
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,120
more time to go to the ietf and talk

70
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,640
about what they want to do then then you

71
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,860
have or then your average Enterprise

72
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,680
user or the supply chain that

73
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,920
enterprises depend on

74
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,540
we have generally not been in the room

75
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,940
because

76
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,700
uh it you know you'd need maybe two

77
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,580
full-time equivalent employees worth of

78
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,400
resource just to spend on making sure

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,319
that your point of view was represented

80
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,140
in the outcomes

81
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,540
turns out that those resources are not

82
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,040
available

83
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,580
so first I'll give you a short

84
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,300
overview of quick itself

85
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,019
it was created at Google by a guy named

86
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,299
Jim roskind who's like me also at Amazon

87
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:43,860
now

88
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,620
um and it was you know to solve the

89
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,739
problem that TCP seems to be really

90
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,799
narrow and really slow and really slow

91
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,420
to change difficult to change

92
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,420
so it was sitting there at the time that

93
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,700
Edward Snowden famously made some

94
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,860
disclosures of some National Security

95
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,140
material and flew to Hong Kong in 2013

96
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,680
and those events were a big deal

97
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,380
um a huge number of people in the world

98
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,019
in particular the people who were

99
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,720
teenagers at in 2013 and who are

100
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,020
20-somethings now said this is an

101
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,419
outrage the idea that the NSA is spying

102
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:28,680
on us and they're putting passive

103
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,380
Optical Splitters and they're doing all

104
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,060
of their they're redirecting our FedEx

105
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,860
shipments and adding you know hardware

106
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,560
and software to our routers this shall

107
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,320
not stand well you know if if you were

108
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,360
older than that you understood that

109
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,400
governments have their own rules and

110
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,740
they play by those rules and that's the

111
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,479
way nation states are you can't change

112
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,520
them so this is the way the world works

113
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,139
and it's the way the world has always

114
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,020
worked and

115
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,400
something I'll talk about at the end is

116
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,620
that this is how the world will continue

117
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,600
to work

118
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,979
um nevertheless there was outrage and so

119
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:05,580
um

120
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,699
this idea of quick

121
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:10,800
was uh you know again originally it was

122
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,740
to move the uh transport protocol out of

123
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,080
the kernel where it is hard to evolve it

124
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,900
because you need your kernel vendor to

125
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,680
incorporate whatever change to TCP uh

126
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,199
and has recently been you know put

127
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,560
forward as an RFC or an RFC draft and

128
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,940
then you have to do a rolling up to

129
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,620
upgrade you have to deal with maybe

130
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,419
different characteristics in your

131
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:34,860
monitoring and your Performance

132
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,360
Management and so forth so TCP as a

133
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,520
logic

134
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,280
was seen as having just a lot of inertia

135
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,500
and so the idea was if we can move all

136
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,060
that stuff into user mode we'll put it

137
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,220
into a shared library or even statically

138
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,919
link it to our binary and then we are

139
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,740
not Hostage to the speed of TCP

140
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,160
evolution by our kernel vendor

141
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,440
and I suppose you could Implement TCP in

142
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,020
user mode but that would require opening

143
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,699
what's called a raw socket which

144
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,000
requires a lot of Privileges and so

145
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,320
um you know your browser probably

146
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,300
doesn't have those privileges

147
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,419
so that was not not chosen what was

148
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,639
chosen in status to build a thing that

149
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,520
does mostly what TCP does and then some

150
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,100
in other words a reliable protocol that

151
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,080
you know if you send something it will

152
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,060
reliably get to the other end in the

153
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,940
order that you that you transmitted it

154
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,759
and um and yet this is all done using

155
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,280
UDP sockets that are not privileged and

156
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,080
so the kernel is completely unaware that

157
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,600
this is happening that has implications

158
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,740
on all of you who like to put malware

159
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,500
into a torture chamber and watch what it

160
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,460
does

161
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,759
in particular there is no connect system

162
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,740
call that you can put a break point on

163
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,560
nor is there an accept system call in

164
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,080
other words if you wanted to know what

165
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,600
is the malware trying to do gee I'd love

166
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,160
to know when it's making a connection

167
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,680
that it is making a connection and I'd

168
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,440
like to know where it's connecting to

169
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,660
and then I'd like to kind of watch the

170
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,419
TLs startup and all the rest that

171
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,520
becomes impossible now because the only

172
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,280
thing the kernel will see is a write or

173
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,419
Ascend system call and the corresponding

174
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:24,240
read or receive system calls and the

175
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,000
payloads of those system calls has been

176
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,199
well encrypted and so I'll come back to

177
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,240
the idea of you know what we're going to

178
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,780
do to torture malware in a quick world

179
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,400
but I just want to say these

180
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,080
implications are not lost on the people

181
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,139
who are pushing for this because what a

182
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,139
malware reverse engineer wants to do is

183
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,720
the same thing in many cases is as some

184
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,699
National Security Agency of some

185
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,500
government would want to do whether it's

186
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,639
your government or another government

187
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,940
doesn't seem to matter it's and you know

188
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,660
I can understand the desire to have

189
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,979
the ability to have whispered

190
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,960
conversations that the government cannot

191
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,819
Monitor and you know decide whether you

192
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,460
are committing treason

193
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,620
and so there's a whole spectrum of

194
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,080
political argument that can be made and

195
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,880
I'll be at the bar later if you want to

196
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,139
make it

197
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,199
um

198
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,879
so the thing that that this team did not

199
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,940
realize is that the internet did not

200
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,699
used to have isps it used to be that we

201
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,159
each built our own networks for our

202
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,219
company or our University or if we were

203
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,559
early connected from home you know we

204
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,700
had to build some Network and then

205
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,320
figure out how to connect it to the rest

206
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,779
of the world but these are managed

207
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,240
private networks everyone using those

208
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,399
networks is an employee of that company

209
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,459
a student of that University a member of

210
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,019
that family

211
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,480
and

212
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,540
those people are not victims of devices

213
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,160
like firewalls

214
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,740
and indeed they are customers of devices

215
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,220
like firewalls and um I think it's safe

216
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,380
to say that nothing about the design of

217
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,040
quick uh is meant to allow this way of

218
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,899
life to continue

219
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,560
and I want to say

220
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,620
uh somebody said to me I don't know last

221
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,560
year or the year before Paul the 1990s

222
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,019
are calling they want your firewall back

223
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,200
um all right so I'll tell you why I

224
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,300
still have a firewall which is that it's

225
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,220
been a long time since I was able to

226
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,860
trust anything that I connect to my

227
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,200
internal Network

228
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,640
either because the supply chain may have

229
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,940
been poisoned the company who made that

230
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,700
particular whatever Linux kernel or

231
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,500
whatever's in that iot device is long

232
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,600
out of business or the company they

233
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,100
bought it from is long out of business

234
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,380
there are no patches that you know so it

235
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,740
might just have old bugs that are well

236
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,260
public who have been well publicized or

237
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,600
it could have been poisoned by somebody

238
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,420
who is trying to gain access to secret

239
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,360
places by putting code in places that

240
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,399
can bypass perimeters and get installed

241
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,100
on the internal networks

242
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,360
generally speaking the stuff that we can

243
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,279
connect to our works today is

244
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:17,040
untrustworthy and I include by that my

245
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,740
own laptops so I'm not saying this is

246
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,560
just your whatever

247
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,140
iot connected refrigerator at home this

248
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,080
is everything it's um I'll come back to

249
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,320
that also uh what I do therefore and

250
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,440
what a lot of Enterprises do is they

251
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,779
allow some kind of traffic and deny the

252
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:37,700
rest

253
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,500
or rarely they will deny some kind of

254
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,440
traffic and allow the rest but generally

255
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,680
speaking it is seen that the operator of

256
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,040
that network has a say as to what that

257
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,560
network is going to carry and this has

258
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,839
an important implication because if you

259
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,339
get infected by some malware and

260
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:01,620
somebody decides that gee you're ddosing

261
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,480
them actually it'll be the the little

262
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,300
camera the baby monitor that you have

263
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,700
facing down into the crib to see to make

264
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,220
sure that your baby is is breathing

265
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,720
peacefully that thing joins botnets and

266
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,940
you as the owner of that device and the

267
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,740
operator of that Network are responsible

268
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,320
for the harm that it causes even though

269
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,180
you don't have any control over what it

270
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,019
will do

271
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,360
so the firewall is where that control

272
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,980
gets instantiated

273
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,959
so

274
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,620
this means all we can look for is normal

275
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,260
traffic and non-normal or anomalous

276
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,200
traffic and this is not a good state to

277
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,260
be in I am I am not painting this as the

278
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,820
place we would have wanted to go if any

279
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,440
of us have been asked this is where we

280
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,440
are

281
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,779
now a nation-state actor and this could

282
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,240
be an authoritarian Nation somewhere out

283
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,519
in the world or it could be maybe your

284
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,860
own National Security Agency in in your

285
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,680
country of origin

286
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,620
they want the Privileges of managed

287
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,899
private networks even for public

288
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,420
networks they want to be able to monitor

289
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,920
in fact they want to be able to surveil

290
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,480
and in some cases some authoritarian

291
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,339
Nations that we can all think of offhand

292
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,660
they want to filter they want to say

293
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,640
nope you're not going to you that packet

294
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,079
is not going to get out of the country

295
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,260
because of where it's going

296
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,079
these are prerogatives of managed

297
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:32,880
private Network operators that are being

298
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,140
usurped by other agencies and if you

299
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,040
usurp a prerogative you will cause a

300
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,220
counter action and this is that

301
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,860
counteraction if these privileges had

302
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,500
not been abused this protocol might not

303
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,139
now exist and you know I wish that

304
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,860
people in positions of power over

305
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,339
nation-state actions would consider the

306
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,180
the law of unintended consequences

307
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,040
but they don't because they'll be

308
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,079
retired by that time

309
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,000
so

310
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,700
um these sites you know what we call

311
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,560
Managed private Network in the old days

312
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,519
was uh this is a site this is my site on

313
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,380
the Internet or the arpanet or the NSF

314
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,420
net or whatever it was

315
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,700
um cannot be secured there's just

316
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,959
there's no way to secure the devices

317
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,899
connected to it and what we do as I said

318
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:31,139
is anomaly detection and that is to say

319
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,240
we look at the signals that that device

320
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,480
is generating and from those signals we

321
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,519
try to guess is it aware of my policies

322
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,720
is it trying to follow my policies is it

323
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,940
ignoring my policies and based on the

324
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,680
level of cooperation that you can tell

325
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,260
by how it behaves you decide whether you

326
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,300
want to keep it or not

327
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,380
um I've I have rejected medical devices

328
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,180
that wanted to come into my house

329
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,360
because they had their own LTE modems

330
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,060
they because I'm an unreliable ISP in

331
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,060
general if you're a medical consumer uh

332
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,300
they really really can't depend on you

333
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,160
to allow your data to get back to

334
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,220
whatever medical supplier you have

335
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,800
um and that's just uh that's all we can

336
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,500
do I just want to say again if we had

337
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,839
thought this through at the early days

338
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,940
when the internet was not so entrenched

339
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,100
and we tried to come up with a solution

340
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,380
to this problem this would not have been

341
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,120
it

342
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,320
on the other hand if we tried to come up

343
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,760
with a design for the internet we'd

344
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,620
still be designing it instead of using

345
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,500
it so I understand why this is so I just

346
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,779
want to make it clear nobody would have

347
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,940
picked this path forward

348
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,680
so

349
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,339
um

350
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:49,880
it's worth mentioning just in passing

351
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,160
this audience is certainly aware that

352
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,380
your

353
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,639
the laws that govern your patch of dirt

354
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,519
that the particular nation whose

355
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,000
boundaries you are operating within

356
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,459
are different in various ways from the

357
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:11,519
laws that apply elsewhere

358
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,560
um so the internet is global but laws

359
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,680
are local which means that laws don't

360
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,139
really intersect with the internet very

361
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,480
much uh the person who is trying to hurt

362
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,980
you is probably not breaking the law

363
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,779
where they are or if they are breaking

364
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,459
it they know how to break it

365
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,260
successfully you're not going to be able

366
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,740
to get recourse other than in giant

367
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,880
cases of you know the great bodily harm

368
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,899
you simply won't be able to get

369
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,240
cooperation at scale for the every

370
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,880
minute of every day crimes that are

371
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,160
being committed because those crimes are

372
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
not crimes everywhere

373
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,699
this is a necessary and predictable

374
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,620
behavior for the internet we could have

375
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,019
known this was coming

376
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,940
now

377
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,079
um

378
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,660
let me throw a bone to those of us who

379
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,579
write software a lot of it was bug free

380
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:08,639
but some of it wasn't and at scale the

381
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,420
law of large numbers begins to apply

382
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,339
there were there are bugs in all

383
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:17,040
software as far as I can I am concerned

384
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,980
because there always has been we have

385
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,620
had to send patches to very expensive

386
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,839
space probes that were orbiting other

387
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,839
planets in the solar system and the QA

388
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,420
budget for the code that went on that

389
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,459
launch was as big as the entire gross

390
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,940
GDP of some Nations but it won't help

391
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,420
because complexity uh it's a little bit

392
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,019
like inertia in in heat systems it

393
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,480
always increases

394
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,139
layering is a way to push the dangers of

395
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,480
that complexity out of your part of the

396
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,139
solution but it makes the solution in an

397
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,600
in Toto more complicated so it's good

398
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,639
for the maker bad for the for the the

399
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,319
user

400
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,459
um and so there's there's just no way to

401
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,699
model any of it you have no idea whether

402
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,980
you have the thing that will get its own

403
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,439
web page someday the way shell shock did

404
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,679
uh present in devices that you're buying

405
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,900
even if they're fairly expensive you

406
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,480
know laptops or whatever

407
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,559
because there's too much software

408
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,559
there's no way for to to possibly

409
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,840
understand how it's going to interact

410
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,140
and patches then give you constant churn

411
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,299
so if you could get a point in time and

412
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,760
say ah I've successfully I've got a

413
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,940
super computer I've successfully modeled

414
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,620
my environment

415
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,080
um that would last an hour and then your

416
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,539
model would be out of date and that

417
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,100
won't change in fact that's going to

418
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,660
speed up

419
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,480
so the best we ever get is a confidence

420
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,200
interval we are safe from a certain

421
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,260
amount of known defects because we patch

422
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,299
the heck out of everything

423
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:06,000
um but this whole we we know there are

424
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,799
unknown defects we just don't know how

425
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,840
bad they're going to be and whether I'm

426
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,220
going to be whether it's going to be

427
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,960
Friday night and I'd rather be with my

428
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,440
family when the zero day comes out

429
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,799
um finally let me point out another

430
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,059
Eternal property of the security

431
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,600
industry which is that um breaking into

432
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,600
things is a profit Center for attackers

433
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,940
and also red teams but in particular

434
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,580
attackers

435
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,960
preventing those break-ins is a cost

436
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,299
center

437
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:39,360
profit always beats

438
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,380
um

439
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,559
sort of just cost you would much rather

440
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,419
make money than save money

441
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:48,780
so uh the bad guys are always going to

442
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,580
have better incentives than the good

443
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,200
guys to the extent that there are good

444
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,340
and bad weather attackers and Defenders

445
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,620
that will not change unless we replace

446
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,340
our Global Society with something based

447
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,580
on DNA that is not ours because this is

448
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,539
who we are at scale

449
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,799
that in turn means that if you're going

450
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,660
to defend your network you're going to

451
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,760
be breaking rules right firewalls were

452
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,460
not part of the original internet model

453
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,620
the expectation was we had these huge

454
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,539
computers in the data center many

455
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:22,980
computers mainframes that kind of stuff

456
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,140
uh there were very few of them and they

457
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,940
had a lot of expert operators and so

458
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,360
they could be expected to be kept safe

459
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,660
and that turned out to be false anybody

460
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,660
who went through the 1980s knows sort of

461
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,580
how many times many computers turned out

462
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,820
to have you know stupid flaws in them

463
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,799
see the Morris Worm for example

464
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,480
but it also turned out not to be a

465
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,600
scalable proposition because now we have

466
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,780
tens of billions of devices you know we

467
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,760
have a lot more devices than we have

468
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,299
people and that Trend will continue and

469
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:00,299
a lot of this stuff is out of date was a

470
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,740
lot of the stuff was out of date when

471
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,179
you bought it

472
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:06,780
so if you want to defend yourself you're

473
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,640
going to have to do things that were not

474
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,039
in the rule set they're not in the rfcs

475
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,160
to have firewalls originally

476
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,900
you'll be breaking rules and you're what

477
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,400
you're doing is you're looking at the

478
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,679
packet flows you're trying to understand

479
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:21,120
what the distributed system is trying to

480
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,120
do now and is that good or bad and if

481
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,400
it's bad how do I stop it

482
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,120
um

483
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,940
now that just as I said earlier it turns

484
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,559
out that everything a site Security

485
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,720
administrator wants to be able to do an

486
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,640
authoritarian government also wants to

487
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,220
do those two actors are

488
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,900
indistinguishable from the point of view

489
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,299
of a protocol

490
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:46,799
so if you are as I say here a passionate

491
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,200
defender of human freedom and you see

492
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,320
this type of abuse it's hard to just sit

493
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,780
down and put up with it and say well I

494
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,179
guess that's the way the world works

495
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:59,580
it's and if you and a couple thousand of

496
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,799
your friends all just think it's time to

497
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,559
put an end to this and move to a

498
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,200
post-national phase of human history

499
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,660
where end users are in charge of

500
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,059
everything and we have autonomy down to

501
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,580
the individual level

502
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,200
that will conflict with the needs of a

503
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,900
site Security administrator

504
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,000
and that state Security administrator is

505
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,100
bound by the law of the market which

506
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,740
requires that their Network be not

507
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,780
understandable

508
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,700
you with me so far these requirements

509
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,559
are all inevitable and they are in

510
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,840
conflict

511
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,419
so after Mr Snowden made those

512
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:39,419
disclosures the ietf

513
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,179
more or less set its hair on fire and

514
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:44,280
said something's got to be done we have

515
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,179
to encrypt everything and this got all

516
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:51,600
the way to the top level of governance

517
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,100
there the internet activities board

518
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,220
internet engineering Steering group the

519
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,659
members the working group chairs

520
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:59,700
everybody got on board with this or they

521
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,320
got driven out

522
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,820
so there are two rfcs which I suggest

523
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,520
you not read during the coffee phase of

524
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,700
your day please read them in the wine or

525
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,400
beer phase of your day because I fear

526
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,679
for your blood pressure

527
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:19,880
um RFC 8890 is especially notable

528
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,780
by saying the internet is for end users

529
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,520
in other words we intend to

530
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,220
disintermediate every everyone else

531
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,460
all right so

532
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,559
check for me if you want to you can just

533
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,260
take a moment right now check your head

534
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,179
feel the back of your skull if you find

535
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,940
an RJ45 Jack raise your hand

536
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,700
if you don't then the internet is not

537
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,980
for end users the internet is for the

538
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,020
devices that we communicate through

539
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:54,120
so RFC 8890 in its correct title would

540
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,159
be the internet is for surveillance

541
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,260
capitalists who manufacture our devices

542
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,900
because they didn't leave any carve outs

543
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,940
in any of their thinking or any of their

544
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,400
directions to working groups or RFC

545
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,220
authors for the idea of a managed

546
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,720
private Network or a site Security

547
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,700
administrator it was assumed that

548
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,860
everybody who was on path who wanted to

549
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,159
interfere uh had to be stopped period no

550
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,140
distinctions

551
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,659
so

552
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:27,240
if you have an intruder well they are an

553
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,480
end user so the internet is for them

554
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,860
um sorry that they're in your network

555
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,780
sorry that they're in your server or

556
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,580
wherever they are but we're going to

557
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,500
make sure that you cannot tell they are

558
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,179
there by looking at the behavior of that

559
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:40,320
server

560
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,780
sounds insane you may think this is an

561
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,280
April Fool's joke and I'm here on the

562
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,280
wrong day it's not it is insane but it's

563
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,760
also true

564
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,520
so

565
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,559
I participated in some of these working

566
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,679
groups and I took exception to the

567
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,780
language here that's in bold

568
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,520
where they're talking about the quick

569
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,380
wire image that's like what the packet

570
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,159
looks like in TCP dumper Wireshark

571
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:10,140
the wire image is not specifically

572
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,360
designed to be distinguishable from

573
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,240
other UDP traffic and I took exception

574
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,520
to this and we had a whole email thread

575
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,100
where where we argued it through and I

576
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,919
lost what I wanted was for it to say the

577
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,200
quick wire image is specifically

578
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,659
designed to be indistinguishable from

579
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,120
other UDP traffic because that's both

580
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,700
true and it is what is recommended by

581
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:37,380
RFC 8890 and RFC 7258 so this feels

582
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,440
dishonest to me but I lost that and so

583
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,679
if you read RFC 9312 this language is

584
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,000
unchanged

585
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,799
I'm not sure what that means about the

586
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,480
psychology of the Internet Protocol

587
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,220
development community

588
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,280
other than it's clearly human

589
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,280
another RFC has to do with DNS over

590
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,700
https and here the Bold phase text is

591
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,240
that these use cases include preventing

592
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,299
on path devices from interfering with

593
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,700
DNS operations

594
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,780
well guess what my firewall is it is an

595
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,120
on path device guess what it does it

596
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,880
interferes with protocol operations

597
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,980
that's why I have it

598
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,720
but um it turns out that again no

599
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,539
provision was made for the idea that

600
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:29,580
some networks are managed and private

601
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,580
and the devices are untrusted and the

602
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,440
software on the devices are untrusted

603
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,640
and it is the operator of what used to

604
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,620
be called an autonomous system but is

605
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,539
clearly no longer autonomous we're all

606
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:45,480
sort of part of a great blob those

607
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,140
operators are not expected to be able to

608
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,500
control what their network does

609
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,700
um

610
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,299
I want to say my day job announced a few

611
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:00,500
days ago some security controls so that

612
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,100
some instance Some Cloud guest inside of

613
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,299
our Cloud

614
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:06,960
um

615
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,440
if it starts doing Doh then that'll

616
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,960
trigger an alarm unless it's configured

617
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,059
to be allowed to do that and the reason

618
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:19,020
is if you are a bad guy and you are

619
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,419
breaking into things and you know that

620
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:24,539
the DNS server DNS resolution path of

621
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,100
the thing you broke into is well

622
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,200
monitored and whatever lookups you might

623
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,080
do while present in that system are

624
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,640
going to be monitored and could

625
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,620
potentially trigger problems then yeah

626
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,020
you're going to use Doh and yes there is

627
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,120
malware already in the world and has

628
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,880
been for the last year that uses Doh in

629
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,059
order to bypass the DNS level detections

630
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:48,000
that are kind of the heart and soul of

631
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,340
ndr

632
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,679
uh and I mean I realize Yara is also

633
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:55,260
important but Yara is also going over

634
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,120
the side when uh when quick comes

635
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,640
because uh no no form of packet

636
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,140
inspection is going to be meaningful at

637
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,000
that time

638
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,600
so just to mention performance briefly I

639
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,279
know this is not exactly the Right

640
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,380
audience but at the moment we've got

641
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,679
load balancers that can see the TCP

642
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,900
header which includes various things

643
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,980
like the window scale

644
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,000
and um

645
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,159
those load balancers are capable of

646
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,620
perturbing these numbers as the packets

647
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,600
pass through them in order to get

648
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,100
certain things to slow down and other

649
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,220
things to speed up well in quick none of

650
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,400
this is visible at

651
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,320
to any of this any such load balance or

652
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,840
or metal box if you didn't participate

653
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,140
in the key exchange and the setup of TLS

654
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,440
1.3 then you will not know what the

655
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,900
parameters are of the conversation which

656
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,440
is taking place through

657
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,640
your own presence in in the graph

658
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,460
and since I mentioned TLS 1.3 I do want

659
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,159
to say some of this is coming even for

660
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,620
https over TCP Port 443

661
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,840
TLS 1.3 supports something called

662
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,940
encrypted client hello it used to be

663
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,740
encrypted server name indicator

664
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,020
basically the the name of the virtual

665
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,220
host you want the web server to act as

666
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,840
when you connect to it used to being

667
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,380
clear text now it's not and that means

668
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,799
that if you have a next-gen firewall

669
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,080
for you know possibly because your

670
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,440
regulator requires you to have one

671
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,320
you can no longer tell when something on

672
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,200
your network makes an outbound TCP 443

673
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,480
sin packet in other words let's let's

674
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,419
talk you can no longer tell what it

675
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:50,159
intends to speak to on the other end

676
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,320
you'll know the IP address but that IP

677
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,240
address probably supports millions of

678
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,640
different names and if you can't see the

679
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,279
name you can't have a rule about which

680
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,380
names should be specifically allowed or

681
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,720
specifically denied

682
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,140
this is not an accident again people who

683
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,299
want to do that include nation-state

684
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:11,720
actors

685
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:14,299
um

686
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,100
so

687
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,860
there are no good choices we are about

688
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,980
to see some bad choices made

689
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,960
um one of them is to do nothing and let

690
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,020
all this happen in which case next time

691
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,940
somebody says hey how come you spam to

692
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,279
me you'll see I have no idea I'm not

693
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,260
responsible for the traffic emanates

694
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,760
from my network and I resent the

695
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,740
implication that that I ever could be

696
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,500
it's all encrypted I can't see it I

697
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,240
couldn't stop it

698
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,299
um why are you bothering me

699
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:48,299
um so doing nothing is is one of the

700
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:53,039
choices you could also say yeah I've got

701
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,620
Regulators I've maybe you're a

702
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,100
government contractor government agency

703
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,779
or you're just

704
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:04,140
um stubborn you might say no we're not

705
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,059
doing that and we're going to do what

706
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:08,700
vixi's been doing for 30 years now on

707
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,039
every Network he's ever operated which

708
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,020
is that we're going to deny UDP by

709
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,260
default unless it is going to a known

710
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,740
protocol on the outside and coming from

711
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:24,059
a known IP address on the inside

712
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:26,159
um a lot of people have told me this is

713
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,440
uh nutball stuff and it certainly breaks

714
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,220
online role-playing games so my children

715
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,200
have a particular thing they have to do

716
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,460
if they want to make one of those work

717
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,779
but um

718
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:39,240
this is going to be quite common because

719
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,299
allowing this to just happen and connect

720
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,120
any actor software Hardware personal

721
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,480
inside your perimeter to any actor on

722
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,080
the outside will be an intolerable risk

723
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,020
to some

724
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,960
you might also say okay we've had a

725
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,880
proxy like this next-gen firewall I

726
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,980
described it was trying to interfere

727
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,140
with TLS startup when it could see the

728
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,700
server name indicator but now we can't

729
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,240
see it so you no longer get to send your

730
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,940
web traffic to the outside you have to

731
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,179
send it to the proxy explicitly you have

732
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:17,279
to agree to trust the key that that

733
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,919
proxy is going to offer you and then you

734
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,320
have to talk to it and it will make all

735
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,120
of your stuff into clear text in order

736
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,320
to apply what may be regulatory policy

737
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,200
enforced by governments to the traffic

738
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,000
and if it decides that you're allowed to

739
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,279
do it then it will regenerate your

740
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,980
session to the outside as your explicit

741
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,600
proxy

742
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,539
this is going to be a firestorm a lot of

743
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:44,340
people are going to complain about this

744
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,580
in fact there is no path from here where

745
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,960
a lot of people are not complaining

746
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,460
about it

747
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,320
um that's that's our Brave New World

748
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,940
that's our next thing

749
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,460
so what's the impact on those of you who

750
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,740
would uh like to be able to torture

751
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,159
malware find out what it's doing you

752
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,179
know they disassemble it and

753
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:07,740
run it in the emulator and all the rest

754
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,799
of that stuff well the malware now has a

755
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,820
new game which is that it'll come with

756
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,899
its own crypto

757
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:19,260
in user mode that will generate these

758
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,659
opaque blobs which will be passed to the

759
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:25,140
kernel over a UDP socket and so stopping

760
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,600
it from making a connection will not be

761
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,360
possible unless you first stop it from

762
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,120
generating the keys and participating in

763
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,100
the key exchange so you're going to have

764
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,500
to start your break points a lot earlier

765
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,779
than you do now otherwise you're not

766
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,220
going to be able to tell what it's doing

767
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,960
later

768
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,399
malwarehouse rights

769
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,559
and um

770
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,120
you know I will say there's a silver

771
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,419
lining uh malware often refuses to start

772
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:56,419
up if it thinks it's in an emulator

773
00:32:56,419 --> 00:32:59,940
there's a whole uh cat and mouse game

774
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,340
that goes on between the reversing

775
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,100
community and the malware Community uh

776
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,779
because the malware does not want you to

777
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:07,980
be able to tell what it's going to be

778
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,500
able to do and then you know break down

779
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,220
the botnet as a result so the things

780
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,260
that a firewall operator will have to do

781
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,960
to defend themselves are probably going

782
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,620
to look to malware like it's you trying

783
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,620
to reverse engineer it and so a lot of

784
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,299
malware is just going to stop starting

785
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:30,659
up because it can't tell the difference

786
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:34,200
between that firewall and a

787
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,279
thread researcher

788
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,799
so the internet is a network of Networks

789
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,200
and that was written on a cocktail

790
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,340
napkin in 1969 and the idea was we'd

791
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,559
build these autonomous networks and they

792
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:52,200
would each have some resources and users

793
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,059
whatever and then we would connect them

794
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,760
together into this big internet thing

795
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,399
okay and this is what it looked like is

796
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:03,299
anybody along the path between where the

797
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:04,799
request is coming from and where it's

798
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,679
going would have a chance to say no I

799
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,080
don't want to do that maybe I don't want

800
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,820
you to send spam you can't connect to

801
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,540
TCP Port 25 from here or something

802
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,260
and um this was not a great system but

803
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,080
it was evolutionary got this way you

804
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,659
know along a certain path and I could

805
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:26,280
certainly think of some things we could

806
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,839
have done differently and earlier that

807
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,940
would have improved things it wouldn't

808
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,000
have been this by the way because now we

809
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,080
don't have that

810
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,659
what we have is

811
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:39,179
we want a dumb pipe we want every actor

812
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,918
including our own operating system

813
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:45,179
Colonel uh our firewall operator our CSO

814
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,159
our regulator

815
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,918
the isps we want everybody to see

816
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,739
nothing but random noise random looking

817
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:53,760
noise

818
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,560
and um

819
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,780
this means it's no longer the internet

820
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,540
is no longer a network of Networks

821
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,880
there's a network of human eyeballs to

822
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,160
be monetized and the people who want to

823
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,920
do that are in no mood to put up with

824
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,920
with our crap

825
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,280
so if you've not heard of shoshana I

826
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,520
urge you to go get this book and read

827
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,099
this book

828
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:21,960
and I'm only going to point to this one

829
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,339
quote

830
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:26,820
but she predicted all of this

831
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,640
before Snowden went to

832
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,339
went to Hong Kong before the ietf set

833
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,079
its hair on fire

834
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,900
and I'll just read this out loud

835
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,960
the challenges of epistemic justice and

836
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,760
epistemic rights

837
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,400
in this new era are summarized in three

838
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,560
essential questions about knowledge

839
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,300
Authority and Power

840
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,220
who knows

841
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,440
and who decides who knows

842
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,079
and who will decide

843
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,920
who knows

844
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,260
who decides who decides who knows

845
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,060
this used to be up to us

846
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:10,759
it turns out we looked like bad stewards

847
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,740
so if we have time for questions

848
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,840
I would like to get some

849
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:25,920
[Applause]

850
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,480
we can take a couple questions

851
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,359
no coffee break

852
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,540
if you won't ask a question I'll I'll

853
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,820
twist Ben's arm to ask a question

854
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,760
Ben take it away

855
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,440
oh wait a minute

856
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,560
thanks Paul m

857
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,780
I I interesting points about quick and

858
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,980
the internet you mentioned firewalls

859
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,060
um

860
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,619
I've always said maybe I'm just too

861
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:06,000
young for that but I always think of

862
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,460
fireballs as some outdated thing and the

863
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,520
right way to do it these days is to just

864
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,339
uh have an end to end a point to point

865
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:16,920
like firewall decrypts everything

866
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,960
decides what to do and if you don't want

867
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,880
to do that then you let it pass through

868
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,040
then you should not visibility is that

869
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,540
not the internet that's

870
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,280
we should be striving to watch if you

871
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,380
have like an Enterprise

872
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,900
then the firewall should see should

873
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,940
either see everything if you decide you

874
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,619
know you want to do that or to see

875
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,660
nothing and not some kind of well who

876
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,420
encrypted it but we leave some domain

877
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,560
names in in the headers

878
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,839
I think that is a reasonable design and

879
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,280
that we could have aimed for it all

880
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,020
along and we could have aimed for it as

881
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,820
part of the change to Quick however

882
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,560
uh I was a lonely voice having that

883
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,440
perspective in that room most people

884
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,900
don't believe that giving anybody that

885
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,859
power could possibly be safe and um let

886
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:07,079
me say in particular if you've got a

887
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,180
toaster

888
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,180
that you know has got shell shock

889
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,920
problems and it's very likely to join a

890
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,900
botnet and you know be spamming on

891
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,460
command

892
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,700
um we don't have a protocol whereby that

893
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,820
toaster can be told what is the name of

894
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,920
the local proxy and what is the key that

895
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,119
you must Trust

896
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,820
so a lot of us said well we have DHCP

897
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,619
and it's extensible just add some more

898
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:33,780
tlvs in there and that'll tell the

899
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,220
toaster well

900
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,460
if that were possible and it's not I'll

901
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,020
tell you why but if that were possible

902
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,079
we have a long tail that toaster is

903
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:45,000
going to last 10 20 years and the

904
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,400
company who made the IP stack for it is

905
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,140
already out of business

906
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,960
but it's not possible because DHCP is

907
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,660
itself not secure and the ietf

908
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,240
Intelligentsia refuses to allow anything

909
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,880
that is to be used for secure security

910
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,880
purposes to be delivered by an unsecure

911
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,839
protocol

912
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,079
and so first we would have to design a

913
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,119
secure protocol and then we would have

914
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,400
to outlive all of the existing toasters

915
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,740
and no one really thinks that that is a

916
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,960
way out of the mess that's going to come

917
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,960
in the next two to five years

918
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,619
thank you

919
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,440
okay last quick question

920
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,180
yeah

921
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,540
quick quick a quick question

922
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,480
hey so you mentioned that there's a

923
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,180
many-to-one mapping uh basically with

924
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,900
ipv4 and domain names but uh with the

925
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,900
upcoming the large Department of IPv6

926
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,140
how do you see this uh

927
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,400
evolved then because of course a pb6

928
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,700
could be a pretty unique mapping

929
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,119
well so IPv6 having as it does all those

930
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:56,300
bits for addresses

931
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,400
usually the convention is you don't have

932
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,900
to do it this way but the convention is

933
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,760
that 64 bits describes the network

934
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,500
you're on and the other 64-bits

935
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,619
describes you as an entity and famously

936
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:09,599
there are devices for example an Apple

937
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,780
iPhone which are willing to Simply take

938
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,140
a different bottom order 64 bits every

939
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,060
once in a while in order that its

940
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,440
previous activities cannot be

941
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,859
cross-correlated by

942
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:25,619
various entities so with subsequent

943
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:27,020
activities

944
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,760
I know one person in the motion picture

945
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,940
industry who wanted to use the bottom 64

946
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,300
bits to number the specific frame of an

947
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,339
mp4 file that you wanted from a file

948
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:39,900
server there's a lot of things you can

949
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,359
do once you have 64 bits of host address

950
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:45,839
space and to your point that could mean

951
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,119
that we don't need a many-to-one mapping

952
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:50,160
anymore and this thing with encrypted

953
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,160
client low would go away by itself but

954
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,680
there's no reason to think this it could

955
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,060
be done that way if you were going to

956
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,040
start a web services company you'd

957
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,780
probably do it that way there's no

958
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,520
reason for Akamai to change what they've

959
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,780
been doing or Cloud front or Cloud flare

960
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,000
or you know if if what you're doing with

961
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,220
this many to one thing is working you're

962
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:14,400
probably going to treat IPv6 as kind of

963
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,859
the same thing but with more bits rather

964
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:18,839
than an opportunity to do things totally

965
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,900
differently and given that at least some

966
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,480
large actors like some of the properties

967
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,880
of this many to one we know that it will

968
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,320
not be the norm

969
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,760
and if it's not going to be the norm

970
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,700
it's not a solution to this problem

971
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,740
all right I'm getting the hook let me

972
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,500
just say one more question but then

973
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,180
you're going to drum me off the field

974
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,780
Ben and I will be here all week and we'd

975
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,700
love nothing better than to talk more

976
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:49,578
about this so please do last question

977
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,320
is this on okay you seem to be

978
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,940
describing

979
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,339
the status quo of

980
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:58,619
you can see everything you can see some

981
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:01,200
things or you can see nothing we're

982
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,440
removing you can see some things option

983
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,720
by this do you see any pass to getting

984
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,259
that back

985
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,260
foreign

986
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,980
[Music]

987
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,900
incredibly long question although it

988
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,220
sounded short

989
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,780
and

990
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,760
um

991
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,339
a path to getting it back would mean

992
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:30,240
something I could do or that we as a

993
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,760
room full of people could go do that

994
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,880
would you know lean toward one possible

995
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,160
future among the others and the answer

996
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,420
to that simply is no

997
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,980
because there are a lot of people not in

998
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,440
this room who really like the properties

999
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,240
of this system

1000
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,880
but what this leads to and the longer

1001
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,880
answer that I won't try to give now

1002
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,180
Begins by saying that um the only reason

1003
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,220
anything ever happens is because of a

1004
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,819
gradient and the gradients that matter

1005
00:43:01,819 --> 00:43:04,920
economically are making more money or

1006
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,359
saving more money

1007
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:08,520
and so you have to find a way to put

1008
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,400
what you hope to do in the form of one

1009
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,500
of those gradients and then figure out

1010
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,540
how you're going to sell it to the

1011
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,220
audience who will either make or save

1012
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,400
that money and I don't know how to do

1013
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,920
that but it's we have until Friday let's

1014
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,319
work it out thank you all again

1015
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:26,460
thank you

1016
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:34,249
[Applause]
