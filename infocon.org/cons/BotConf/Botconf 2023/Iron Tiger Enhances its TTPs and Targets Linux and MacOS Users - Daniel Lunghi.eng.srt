1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,599
thank you

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,740
so hi I'm Daniel Lungi I work for Trend

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,020
Micro and I'm glad to be here to discuss

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,000
some findings we made on the iron Tigers

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,280
attack tour lately this talk is still

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,780
pretty clear so feel free to take any

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,460
selfies with my sludge if that's your

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,980
thing I don't mind

9
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,960
so the this is the alternative to talk

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,880
so after a quick introduction we will

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,980
see the different infection vectors that

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,560
this protector uses we'll focus on three

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,539
custom malware families that they

14
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:28,500
develop

15
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,420
we'll discuss something about the

16
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,180
targets we will explain our methodology

17
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,100
for attributing this campaigns to this

18
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,040
protector before we conclude this talk

19
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,260
so iron Tiger has many names and misery

20
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,559
Panda apt-27 etc etc they have been here

21
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,239
for a long time now so we have been

22
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,280
tracking them also for a long time the

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,620
first paper we wrote on them is was in

24
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,320
2015. and it actually mentioned a

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,140
campaign that happened in 2010 so they

26
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,120
have been here for a long time and since

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,800
the last three years we've been blogging

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,800
about them almost every year

29
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,040
so they are known to use exploitable

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,040
abilities to to infect their users so

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,799
according to recent public reports they

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,060
have been using the proxy Logan

33
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,100
vulnerabilities to look for Shell

34
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,020
vulnerability one vulnerability and

35
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,260
attraction conference and older reports

36
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,000
like they use also SharePoint or

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,400
exchange to compromise their targets

38
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,100
prior to 2020 they were known to use

39
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,860
watering holes also some weaponized

40
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,780
documents using the Royal Road

41
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,900
exploitation toolkit or even in all the

42
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,460
very old school campaigns they use

43
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,320
proficient emails with raw attachments

44
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,040
with malicious executable files

45
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,140
but no more recently they they switched

46
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,500
to supply chain attacks 20 December 2020

47
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,920
is set reported the supply chain attack

48
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,360
targeting able desktop which is a chat

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,579
application used among others by the

50
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,159
Mongolian government

51
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,540
last year we found a super chain attack

52
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,460
on mimichat which is also a chat

53
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,040
application used in Southeast Asia so

54
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,420
we'll focus a bit more on this second

55
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,540
supply chain attack

56
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,038
is a chat application as you can see

57
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,959
it's written in Chinese if you've been

58
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,360
here at botconf last year you already

59
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,300
have seen this screenshot actually

60
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,340
because we discussed another detector

61
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,739
Earth but baroka in the operation

62
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,840
gambling puppet and they also targeted

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,760
this same application so this is

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,000
something that was interesting to us but

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,879
in this in this case of iron tiger it's

66
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,260
actually a supply chain attack so they

67
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,200
modified the legitimate installers

68
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,720
delivered by the legitimate website and

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,480
we founded this they did that targeting

70
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,900
uh the windows installer in 2021 on the

71
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,080
Mac OS installer in 2022.

72
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,819
if you go to the registration page of

73
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,920
this application you can register by a

74
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,200
mobile phone and the prefixes you can

75
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,800
use is this limited list so you can see

76
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,840
that it's mostly Southeast Asian

77
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,540
countries so this gives an idea of where

78
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,519
the targets of interest for this

79
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,620
protector could be

80
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,200
but also you could wonder what is this

81
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,879
Mimi chat application I've never heard

82
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,700
about it is it legitimate actually or is

83
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,700
it developed by the protector so we we

84
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,200
search it for that to answer for that

85
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,239
question we found no reference to the

86
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,280
developing company on the website

87
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,140
and if you searched at a time for me

88
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,060
chat there was no relevant results also

89
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,980
in search engines actually

90
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,440
so we looked at the the file properties

91
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,379
so on the left the executable properties

92
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,580
on the right the electron JS

93
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,900
package.json file and we found

94
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,840
references to sick top to name sick top

95
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,299
with the sector.com domain name

96
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,220
so remember that name is the probably

97
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,920
the developing company name we search

98
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,500
for that on certain Giants we found this

99
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,379
like job offerings where we saw so you

100
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,180
can read here but it's actually a

101
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,040
company based in Philippines

102
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,120
uh they are hiring an Android developer

103
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,340
and the the the salary they offer is

104
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,140
paid in Taiwanese dollars so they

105
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,879
actually hire a company based in

106
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,239
Philippines hiring Taiwanese Developers

107
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:10,980
so let's go back to this chat

108
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,680
application the desktop version is built

109
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,900
with with electron.js framework which is

110
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,720
multi-platform which means that the the

111
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,880
developer does not need to change the

112
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,280
code to make a build for Windows or Mac

113
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,919
OS Etc The Protector modified the

114
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,620
electron main.js file to download the

115
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,540
malicious payload so they actually

116
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,180
inserted this obfuscated JavaScript code

117
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,139
on top of this file this is known to be

118
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:38,940
packed with Dean Edwards JavaScript

119
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,160
Packer this is a packer that is

120
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,660
available online

121
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,600
and so if you input this like a very

122
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,020
simple code alert one on the packets you

123
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,360
will get this like obfuscated very long

124
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,919
string of JavaScript code

125
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,380
for the windows version that was

126
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,960
trojanized that was the the obfuscated

127
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,820
code it's very simple JavaScript code

128
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,979
download in a file looking at the

129
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,020
platform on the loaded three files

130
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,699
accurate from this IP address to the

131
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,740
temporary directory and running the

132
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,240
executable file

133
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,440
for the Macos version it was similar

134
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,080
called sniper only the platform is

135
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,820
different it's Darwin in this case which

136
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,340
is related to Mac OS the IP address is

137
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,840
also different and it only downloaded

138
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,759
one file in our shell which is a malware

139
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,940
we will see later

140
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,720
interesting thing about this supply

141
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,539
chain attack so when we were monitoring

142
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,600
them the sick top company published a

143
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,800
new version

144
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,440
so I downloaded actually the the newer

145
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,780
version looked at it and it was clean so

146
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,940
it was interesting so I told my

147
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,100
colleague okay this is weird this new

148
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,380
version is clean so he downloaded a few

149
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,120
hours later he downloaded the same file

150
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,400
from the same legitimate website and he

151
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,500
told me no this is compromised so you

152
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,720
double check it so I double checked it

153
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,479
was clean so I downloaded it again and

154
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,060
actually I found it was a different file

155
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,860
that I didn't write the second time and

156
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,380
it was indeed compromised so it was

157
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,300
interesting so I looked a bit more about

158
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,880
it and in this installer of limit chat

159
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,940
there is some like 7-Zip archive so this

160
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,160
is good because it will keep the

161
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,259
timestamp of the modification time of

162
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,419
the files so on the left you can see the

163
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,259
the legitimate unmodified

164
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,000
installer so we'll see all the files are

165
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,940
mostly modified at the same time and on

166
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,639
the right it's the the compromised

167
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,039
backdoor installer by the protector and

168
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,539
you can see only one file has a

169
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,120
different like modification timestamp

170
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,639
and it was modified one one hour and a

171
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,660
half later

172
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,580
so it means that the protector it took

173
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,620
one hour and a half to a protractor to

174
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,539
build to to make a new build that is

175
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,160
compromised which I believe it's pretty

176
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,500
pretty nice it's pretty quick on the

177
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,680
side

178
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,900
so another question we do we ask

179
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,639
ourselves is how did they manage to

180
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,340
compromise sick top so we don't have the

181
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,740
final answer because we try to reach to

182
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,180
six top and actually never got any

183
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,139
answer

184
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,199
but we found interesting

185
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,699
data in our Telemetry so there is this

186
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,860
domain name trustworister.org which is

187
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,199
actually related to The Protector

188
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,660
and we found some get requests to some

189
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,240
to retrieve some JavaScript script from

190
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,819
this domain followed by actually a post

191
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,220
request to a PHP script hosted on the

192
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,479
same sub domain

193
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,759
so we could retrieve this JavaScript

194
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,860
script analyze it it was very simple

195
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,199
called sniper of JavaScript that was

196
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,780
actually looking for like username on

197
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,599
password variable names and that would

198
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,699
retrieve the content and send it to the

199
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,419
PHP script so it was a password grabber

200
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:48,780
and the the get request actually had a

201
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,479
referral and the referral was some like

202
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,900
sub-domains of six top six topsup.com on

203
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,620
seektop.vip so actually

204
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,360
the refer was related to the sick top

205
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,500
company

206
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,660
so I redacted here the sub domain

207
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,300
because it actually still online but it

208
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,639
was an authentication portal for some

209
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,740
developer tool

210
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,740
so probably and actually the the request

211
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,479
came from a Taiwanese IP address so

212
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:16,919
probably at Taiwanese developer which

213
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,680
with matches actually what we found

214
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,539
probably related to sick top

215
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,879
so our guess here is that per video to

216
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,039
attack or compromise these portals to

217
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,780
inject this JavaScript script and use

218
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,360
that to retrieve credentials to get an

219
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,279
access to the sector build environment

220
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,860
easy access to to that and then that is

221
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,440
how they can quickly modify the

222
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,020
installers of mimichat

223
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,420
so more recently we found another like

224
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,279
chat application that could be used as

225
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,100
an infection Vector so in November 2022

226
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,660
we found the sys update which is a

227
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,640
malware we will discuss later sample

228
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,800
name you do client with this version

229
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,880
number

230
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,040
so we I research for Udo which is

231
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,959
actually again a chat application but

232
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,820
more oriented to Enterprise customers

233
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,000
developed by a Chinese company that I am

234
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,100
and they actually in their website they

235
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,440
list all their customers so this is like

236
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,779
an accept of it and they are all based

237
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,040
in mainland China

238
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,959
and some of them are very big like more

239
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,680
than 10 000 customers or workstations in

240
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,740
multiple government or manufacturing or

241
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,899
energy industry

242
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,180
so it could be actually a nice infection

243
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,180
Vector on the left you have the modified

244
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,180
sys update file properties and on the

245
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,500
right it's like a legitimate you do

246
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,899
installer so you can see the version

247
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:39,300
number and it's quite the same the only

248
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,680
difference here would be the file

249
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,600
description and product name which in

250
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,300
the modified version was iTalk

251
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,940
and so we also found on some victim this

252
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,459
like program files I talk folder which

253
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,580
contained legitimate YouTube files

254
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,459
signed by Linda I am so the developer of

255
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,920
YouTube so legitimate files in this

256
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,260
iTalk folder so our guests here so again

257
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,600
we don't have the final answer but our

258
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,279
guess is that the protector somehow

259
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,380
repackaged this you do chat application

260
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,540
backdoored it and named it I talk and

261
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,600
use it as a lure to deliver this update

262
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,700
so let's not discuss some of the malware

263
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,040
toolkits used by this protector

264
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,620
so we've we've seen them use like five

265
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,740
different malware families in 2021

266
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,600
hyperbro which is actually only for

267
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,820
Windows sys update which works on

268
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,880
Windows on more recently on Linux

269
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,580
our shell which runs on Linux and Mac OS

270
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,920
on Pandora on high then which are two

271
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,839
windows root kits and the last one being

272
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,519
available on GitHub

273
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,800
so for Pandora and hiding they are just

274
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,560
here for your reference but we will not

275
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,660
talk more about them later

276
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,660
so hyper broad has multiple features

277
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,459
features that you would expect from any

278
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,320
back directory so file manager service

279
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,079
manager process manager screenshot

280
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,399
grabbing code execution etc etc

281
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,760
uh the it appeared actually in 2017

282
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,100
and it is the evolution of another

283
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,500
malware family named HTTP browser that

284
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,360
appeared in 2015.

285
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,820
and then in 2019 there was an updated

286
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,440
version of hyperbro

287
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,100
this updated version uh actually added

288
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,079
some features like clipboard stealing

289
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,899
key login Windows registry manipulation

290
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,720
on timestamping and one interesting

291
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,640
thing is that they change actually the

292
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,640
Ure paths to the CNC and so in the

293
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,220
updated version there is this API slash

294
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,920
V2 Ajax and this is nice because there

295
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,560
are very few rate of force positive so

296
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,899
if you find like this some post request

297
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,540
to this URL path it probably means you

298
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,360
have hyperbro in your network

299
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,760
it is usually distributed as a set of

300
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,160
three files like plugging so it will be

301
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,500
one executable file that is legitimate

302
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,779
on sign with authenticate certificate

303
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,120
that will actually be valuable

304
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,880
vulnerable to side loading dlls

305
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,800
vulnerability so it will side load the

306
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,920
dll that will then load a third file

307
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,920
which is usually some encrypted or

308
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,100
compressed payload the final payload

309
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,779
so we found these are the different

310
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,240
names that that we found for data has

311
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,760
been used by uh to download the hyper to

312
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,980
load hyperbro so as you can see the list

313
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,779
is pretty short actually so that there

314
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,519
have not been that that many dll names

315
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,680
but this is only for your reference and

316
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,740
please please don't like uh only use

317
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,260
this for attribution for example if you

318
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,380
see some mpsvc.dll file being sideloaded

319
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,660
it does not mean that it is an hyperbro

320
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,399
it does not mean it is iron tiger

321
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,920
because other actors will sometimes

322
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,899
abuse the same vulnerability so this is

323
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,100
just like for your information

324
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,240
um Iron tiger is also known to use

325
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,180
storage signing certificates so we've

326
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,860
seen some my purple samples been signed

327
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,139
by a cheater mobile certificate in 2021

328
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,120
and 2022.

329
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,860
so let's let's now talk about this

330
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,380
updates it's again a custom backdoor

331
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,480
again same kind of feature so this is

332
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,560
like boring slide so I'll skip it

333
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,540
this update the oldest sample we found

334
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,920
is in 2015 uh there there was in 2020 a

335
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,839
new loading mechanism so instead of

336
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,480
using three files we saw them using four

337
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,820
files so we blogged about it but then

338
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,440
it's the only time we saw this so it's

339
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,120
quite funny they know they are back to

340
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,399
three files being used and last year

341
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,160
they published a new newer version so

342
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,040
this new version added some support for

343
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,779
the Azure Library

344
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,120
this is a celebrity to it is

345
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,959
asynchronous Library multi-platform so

346
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,940
it totally changed to cut structure so

347
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,560
it makes the reversing a bit more

348
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,899
difficult because the it's more it's

349
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,120
harder to follow the code flow but we

350
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,860
believe that protector did that because

351
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,980
they can now they added support for the

352
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,899
Linux platform so this Library being

353
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,279
multi-platform this is probably the

354
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,200
reason why they did this in the first

355
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,060
place and they also added one

356
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,980
interesting feature which is DNS

357
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,980
tunneling so they would use the base 32

358
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,680
algorithm to encode some data with a

359
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,240
custom alphabet actually and they would

360
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,120
use the text the DNS takes the records

361
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,480
to send or receive data to the CNC

362
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,120
this is the list of the dlls I've been

363
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,560
inside loaded so you can see the list is

364
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,240
a bit more it's a bit longer than for

365
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,639
hyper Pro the interesting part here so

366
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,060
this DLP print 32.drl has already been

367
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,760
seen for hyperbro so again this is not

368
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,100
as you can as I said before don't rely

369
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,260
on this solely for for making some

370
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,820
assumptions and the malware family that

371
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,860
is delivered the interesting part are

372
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,740
the two more recent libraries lib was a

373
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,959
shared on in pet red because actually

374
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,360
what we found is that those two

375
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,480
libraries are side loaded by legitimate

376
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,000
Wazoo executables so Wazoo is an open

377
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,100
source cyber security platform

378
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,560
and actually what happened here is that

379
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,199
at one victims Wazoo was actually

380
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,600
deployed so it was used there

381
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,699
and we believe that the protector

382
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,980
noticed that Wazoo has been used and

383
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,199
they actually search it specifically for

384
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,420
vulnerabilities the LLC loading foreign

385
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,639
executables

386
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,440
unfounded actually so these

387
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,000
vulnerabilities were unreported

388
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,399
previously and the

389
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,519
because that makes that they will use

390
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,040
some Wazoo executable running under the

391
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,139
victim and as the victim is using Wazoo

392
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,940
this will look legitimate so it's kinda

393
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,339
actually clever on the protector side

394
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,260
and it shows how targeted their

395
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,199
campaigns can be

396
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,880
they also use science certificates for

397
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,220
this update so in 2018 one certificate

398
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,560
for for Kepler from Kepler Technologies

399
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,959
and more recently a more interestingly

400
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,380
we saw one certificate belonging to a VM

401
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,839
protect developer so VM protect as you

402
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,180
might know is some software solution

403
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,079
that is used to pack uh code so to make

404
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,360
the reversing and generating some code

405
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,639
very complicated they Implement a custom

406
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,320
virtual machine

407
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,480
and so they they probably compromise the

408
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,579
the we found some samples being signed

409
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,440
by this certificate belonging to this VM

410
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,440
protect developer we found other

411
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,240
legitimate files being assigned by the

412
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,519
same certificate so they looked actually

413
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,000
related to some VM protect demo version

414
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,579
uh but also this helped us to Pivot and

415
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,339
find other malware families we found the

416
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,440
plastic rotation tool which is a custom

417
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,720
password on cookie stealer for Chrome

418
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,860
browser

419
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,139
and we also found very recently in

420
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,899
January it was a more puzzling for us we

421
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,600
found a red line sample so red line is a

422
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,459
malware family a Steeler that will

423
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:39,959
actually be discussed tomorrow more in

424
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,300
detail and we believe it's probably

425
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,339
unrelated to our own tiger because it's

426
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:46,800
more oriented to our cyber crime while

427
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,660
while iron tiger is more oriented

428
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,600
towards Espionage so we have multiple

429
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
guesses about this

430
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,160
one reason could be that iron tiger

431
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,380
compromise VM protect and got the

432
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,480
certification certificate from there

433
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,120
maybe they found a way to extract the

434
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,619
certificate from the demo version maybe

435
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,540
it was a hardcore it there on maybe

436
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,939
Redline did the same on their own or

437
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,679
maybe they bought the certificate from

438
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,660
the underground and

439
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,059
as did the red line developers we don't

440
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:15,959
know yet

441
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,240
also funny part is that one of the

442
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,220
sample was actually packed with VM

443
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,599
protect which gives us this kind of

444
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,720
headaches that you can see here

445
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,780
uh no let's talk about our shell so some

446
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,340
of the features again it's very simple

447
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,940
backdoor that collects OS information

448
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,500
sends and receives commands to the CNC

449
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,140
list files Etc are always the same so

450
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,940
the interesting part here is that it's

451
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,700
compiled for Linux and Mac OS so we

452
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,500
found the oldest version for Linux in

453
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,799
2021 and for Mac OS in 2022 which shows

454
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,840
the interest on for those platforms on

455
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,780
the protector side

456
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,100
some numbers here about the

457
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,679
infrastructure some statistics since

458
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,039
November 2020 we actually found 28

459
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,799
hyperbole cncip addresses and actually

460
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,780
only one in 2023

461
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,900
around the same number of cncs for C sub

462
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,080
date like 30 and again only one in 2023

463
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,419
but for the newer version of this update

464
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,400
that actually uses domain names we found

465
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,740
nine different domain names since May

466
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,120
2022

467
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,940
and also interesting is that one of them

468
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,299
actually contain the in the domain name

469
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,460
the name of the targeted company name so

470
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,440
this means that the protector at the

471
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,600
time of domain registration already knew

472
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,760
that they would Target that company so

473
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,400
again it shows that the the Target that

474
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,440
their campaign is quite quite well

475
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,020
and only we only found five cnc's for

476
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,700
Usher family

477
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,160
so a timeline summary in 2015 this

478
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,220
update appeared 2017 hyperbro both for

479
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,900
Windows platform

480
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,620
2011 our shell for Linux and in 2022 our

481
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,660
share on this update for Mac OS platform

482
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,340
this is some kind of summary of the

483
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,460
platforms being targeted and when

484
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,940
so let's now discuss the targets

485
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,880
for 2022 and 2023 we found 13 targets

486
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,940
only in our telemetry and in the Taiwan

487
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,080
and Philippines

488
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,360
and we out of these 13 targets we could

489
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,400
identify only two of them so one of them

490
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,620
was a Taiwanese gaming company on the

491
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,780
other one a Filipino gambling company so

492
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,299
actually this shifts towards gambling

493
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,580
and gaming industry in Southeast Asia

494
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,539
has been seen since 2019.

495
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:30,780
also the the you do infection Vector

496
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,700
that we mentioned before suggests

497
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,160
actually maybe an internal civilians

498
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,820
targeting so mainland China targeting so

499
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,559
if you're not based in Southeast Asia

500
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,240
you are not in the gaming or gambling

501
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,640
industry you might ask why should I care

502
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,200
about this threat actually

503
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,140
well I have an answer for for this in

504
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,780
January 2022 bfv which is a German

505
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,660
government agency reported that hyperbro

506
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,640
was used to Target German commercial

507
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,140
companies

508
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,960
and they provided some error rules in

509
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,480
that report and and the metadata there

510
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,460
was one Ash that actually was listed in

511
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,419
our blog post from April 2021. then in

512
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,160
September of last year Caesar which

513
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,740
let's say is a US third reported that

514
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,020
hyperbro was used to Target defense

515
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,500
sector in organization

516
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,840
they provided an other another Ash

517
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,700
different one but that was also listed

518
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,700
in our blog post from April 2021 and

519
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,559
andran SEC last year which is a French

520
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,480
company

521
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,400
also published a report of instant

522
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,900
response they made in a French company

523
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,200
that uh where they found hyperbole been

524
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,160
used to

525
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,559
they didn't provide any iocs or industry

526
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,260
targeted but from the blog post you can

527
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,200
see that the tptps they they discuss are

528
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,480
definitely the same ones that we we saw

529
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,600
in April 2021 and remember remember that

530
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,480
at the time 2021 ourselves are only seen

531
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,120
gambling being targeted so this shows

532
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,820
that are actually our vision is biased

533
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,919
by our customers and dependent on our

534
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,200
Telemetry but definitely this protector

535
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,299
targets Western countries

536
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:09,059
on sensitive Industries too

537
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,799
so let's now discuss a bit about the

538
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,480
attribution on how we attributed these

539
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,640
campaigns to this protector the first

540
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,740
hint we we got was the usage of

541
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,260
hyperbrom malware family so in the

542
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,660
community everyone seems to think that

543
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,580
hyperbole is exclusive to iron tiger

544
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,260
protector

545
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,240
but we are not sure about this because

546
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,120
in actually in October 2019 we found

547
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,039
this updated version of hyperbro that we

548
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,200
already mentioned and we found this

549
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,520
through an operation drb control

550
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,960
investigation

551
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,220
and then the next year in December 2020

552
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,500
Avast an asset published different blog

553
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,940
posts about different campaigns that

554
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,460
actually happened in 2020 and these

555
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,260
campaigns were using old versions of

556
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,880
hyperbole

557
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,520
so our question is why if you're only a

558
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,320
single group is using this this malware

559
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,280
family

560
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,020
if they have access to the newer version

561
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,720
why would they use the old version for

562
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,539
more recent campaigns so one answer

563
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,760
could be that maybe there are multiple

564
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,919
groups that have access to this malware

565
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,860
so we search it for better attribution

566
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,059
hints

567
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,039
so this is what we found we found this

568
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:17,039
our shell Linux sample that connected to

569
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,380
this IP address and this IP address when

570
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,419
we looked at the reverse DNS we found

571
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,880
this like in BIO weird string domain

572
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,960
name

573
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,440
and in the previous report for we made

574
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,480
for iron tiger we found this like system

575
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,880
date on hyperbro samples that connected

576
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,100
to these two different IP addresses so

577
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,840
you can notice that the top IP address

578
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,659
is in the same range of the RCL IP

579
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:40,860
address on the left

580
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,020
and if you looked at the reverse DNS for

581
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,940
those IP addresses there were also again

582
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,700
the same weird and bio string

583
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,700
but the the hyperbola sample dated back

584
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,740
to October 2020 this is update to

585
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,320
December under our shell to in June of

586
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,900
2021 so there was there was multiple

587
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,240
months apart from this uh this

588
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,340
infrastructure link so we we decided to

589
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,380
look a bit more if we could find better

590
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,419
hints again for attribution

591
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,520
so we looked at this mimichat installer

592
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,799
that was compromised so we mentioned

593
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,020
already that it contains some packed

594
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,900
JavaScript code that actually connected

595
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,520
to this IP address this IP address

596
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,640
hosted one RCL malware sample but also

597
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,700
hyper and high performer sample

598
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,020
and when we looked at the

599
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,600
characteristics of this hyperbro moral

600
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,120
sample so let's say the Imp Ash the the

601
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,520
rich header characteristics we found

602
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,919
that they actually matched some other

603
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,780
samples that we already attributed to

604
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,780
our iron tiger in our previous report

605
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,179
uh for from hyperbro Pandora assist

606
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:44,520
update samples but yet we were still

607
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,700
like using our own research to to to to

608
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,280
find the attribution so we search it for

609
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,440
more and we found that this apple row

610
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,900
was signed by Cheetah Mobile certificate

611
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,600
and actually this certificate was

612
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,000
mentioned in the German bfv cyber brief

613
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,740
that we mentioned before so okay now we

614
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,360
can rely on some government entity

615
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,640
attribution so we were glad that we had

616
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,740
this and okay this was iron tiger in our

617
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,020
opinion one last hint that was found

618
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,419
actually by Sequoia is that this Dean

619
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:14,400
Edwards there was good Packer was also

620
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,559
used in some previous lucky Mouse so

621
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,720
lucky much is the name for iron tiger

622
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,720
for Kaspersky so in a previous documents

623
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,220
companion some water holding campaign

624
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,559
and that the Marvel delivered was hyper

625
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,480
Pro so again this is like more low

626
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,480
confidence hint but still relevant to to

627
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,340
discuss it

628
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,460
so let's now conclude this presentation

629
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,740
so we saw that iron tiger develops its

630
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,659
own Marvel families and Upstate updates

631
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:41,240
them regularly

632
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,220
they use multiple infection vectors but

633
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,320
the chat applications are actually one

634
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,980
like strong Trend Underside for the the

635
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,080
latest campaigns

636
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,820
uh we have seen they are interested

637
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,580
actually in Linux on Macos platforms on

638
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,320
top of Windows platform so this is like

639
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,460
interesting

640
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,100
and also we saw that they carefully will

641
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,740
plan their campaigns so they will first

642
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,600
like steal some signing certificates so

643
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,740
they could sign their own malware's

644
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,240
the maybe with the

645
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,220
the goal to be less detected for example

646
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,080
they would search for vulnerabilities

647
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,059
that are relevant to the their targets

648
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,400
they will register domain names also

649
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,860
related to their targets and they are

650
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,140
even able to to identify some kind of

651
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,200
totally unknown on small application

652
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,179
like MiMi chats because they probably

653
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:31,980
know that this application is used by

654
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,539
the the people that are targeting so

655
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:34,559
that they have a good like

656
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,240
reconnaissance capability

657
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,580
we also mentioned this shift in the

658
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,700
targeting since 2019 but as we mentioned

659
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,200
the former targeting of sensitive

660
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,880
Industries and Western countries still

661
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,020
applies

662
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,880
so this is like all the references for

663
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,740
the different blog posts I mentioned

664
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,900
before and if you have any question I

665
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,500
will be glad to answer them

666
00:25:54,500 --> 00:26:03,620
[Applause]

667
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,639
okay now the questions

668
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,400
hmm

669
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,299
okay

670
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,980
hi good representation

671
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,799
my question is I know the memory chat is

672
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:29,100
focused on Asia what is the point of

673
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,279
infection for a for the German German

674
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:35,100
companies I imagine that the German

675
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,600
would not install me Michelle

676
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,740
they didn't the German

677
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,960
reporters and talk about the infection

678
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,480
vectors or or maybe I'm I'm wrong I mean

679
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,100
I think they they mentioned some

680
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,620
vulnerabilities being used to to deliver

681
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,960
this I probably malware I think they

682
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,179
they use computers exposed to the

683
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:00,120
internet and yeah exactly some like

684
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,299
communities and servers being faced yeah

685
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:06,179
connect to internet exactly

686
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:07,740
foreign

687
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,460
yes

688
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,059
thank you very much for the presentation

689
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,720
and great talk and my question is like

690
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,299
two short questions but one of them is

691
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:33,299
about Taiwanese Target can your real

692
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,900
industry which that Target is operating

693
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,919
in

694
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,500
which industry started in Taiwan yeah it

695
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,299
was the gaming on the gambling industry

696
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,760
in Taiwan and also some it providers

697
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,600
yeah

698
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,900
okay thanks and um another question is

699
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,640
you mentioned like

700
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,400
13 targets you've discovered yourself

701
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,320
and

702
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,020
can you share was it through some kind

703
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,080
of your internal research which was

704
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,240
spawned by previous

705
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,200
[Music]

706
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,039
um incidents or it was all outside of

707
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,140
kind of Trend Micro was reported by the

708
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,720
customers to you no it was actually we

709
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,580
have two ways of looking and finding for

710
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,200
the so the question was how did we find

711
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,480
the 13 Targets in our Telemetry so we

712
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,640
had two ways for doing this uh one way

713
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,100
was searching for the iocs that we

714
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,900
identified so the different ashes of the

715
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,059
like dll loaders for example that that

716
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:30,179
we found so of course we had some all of

717
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:31,919
some of the Linux article samples also

718
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,480
we had some detections for this so it's

719
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,460
the detection of the files on another

720
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,340
way for the how we found them was the

721
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,080
connections in the like network

722
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,080
connections as we had identified some a

723
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,760
list of domain names or IP addresses

724
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,919
related to a tactor we search it for

725
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:48,659
connections to those domain names and IP

726
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:51,000
address so it was file on network

727
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
connections

728
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,700
yeah yeah exactly we none of them was

729
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,799
reported to us we found look for them in

730
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,020
our Telemetry so this also I mean this

731
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,779
is also why I think you should enable

732
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,580
the Telemetry but of course that's up to

733
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,799
you but I know that that's actually why

734
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,400
our Telemetry is biased because usually

735
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,919
European customers will disable the

736
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,120
Telemetry so

737
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,640
this does not mean that within our

738
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,100
customers there is no target for iron

739
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,200
Target but it only means that we don't

740
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,000
see it in the telemetry

741
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,658
any other questions

742
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,840
one two three

743
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,040
okay thank you

744
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:48,159
[Applause]
