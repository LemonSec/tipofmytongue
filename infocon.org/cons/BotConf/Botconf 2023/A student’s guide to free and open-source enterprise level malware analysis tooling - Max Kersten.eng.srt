1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,020
all right

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,139
so the title of the talk is a bit of a

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,360
contradicting right free open source

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,460
Enterprise malware analysis usually the

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,139
Enterprises keep this

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,139
propriety

7
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:18,720
but I feel like there's quite some open

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,880
source tools out there that can help

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,640
especially aspiring analysts or those

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,920
who are independent on a budget students

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,320
startups

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,080
I mean a lot of the stuff that we use is

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,920
not cheap scaling is hard as well or so

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,660
it might seem

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,100
so table of contents first a brief slide

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,780
about me then some of the goals and

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,180
expectations that we have here the title

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,280
can raise various questions but not

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,980
necessarily all of them are what I set

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,860
out to to answer and then I want to talk

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,660
about the malware pipeline itself

22
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,660
collections detections manual analysis

23
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,000
and some resources

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,660
including some seamless shelf promotion

25
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,960
and some time for Q a so about me my

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,460
name is Max Kirsten go by the nickname

27
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,900
of Libra

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,540
you can reach out to me on any of these

29
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,020
handles afterwards if you have questions

30
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,580
or reach out to me at the conference or

31
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,100
Gala tonight I work for tralex in the

32
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,560
advanced research team and we do malware

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,020
analysis I think that's the the tldr

34
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,580
here

35
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,040
now for the goals and expectations uh

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,500
premium Services often provide you with

37
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,020
premium quality

38
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,340
that you would expect

39
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,020
now

40
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,000
you don't necessarily need to use those

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,619
tools but there's often a trade-off

42
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:41,939
versus the time you need to invest

43
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,979
versus what you can get if you pay money

44
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,900
assuming you have that money and you

45
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,939
make Revenue

46
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,040
having said that these are obviously

47
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,579
only accessible if you pay your premiums

48
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,740
now I don't want to discredit any

49
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,640
service that exchanges a service as a

50
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,460
subscription in any way shape or form

51
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,219
and I think that a lot of them if not

52
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,799
all do a good job

53
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,300
I will mention some of the free and open

54
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,819
source Services here but I want to

55
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,500
preface this by saying that I have no

56
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,660
affiliation here this is merely my

57
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,180
personal view on this and your view

58
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,160
might differ

59
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,440
feel free to contribute as I think we

60
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,599
can all benefit from that but don't see

61
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,520
this as an as an advertisement for

62
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,700
something I am affiliated with

63
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,280
now the goals and expectations what I

64
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,080
usually use as a benchmark is the

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,720
Raspberry Pi I have laying under my desk

66
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,200
which is old it's a rispered by 3B just

67
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,879
as a reference that has one gigabyte of

68
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,580
memory and what I was aiming for is

69
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,800
roughly a 60-day sample retention period

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,959
so you would need to have the storage

71
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,879
for that

72
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,099
the goal here is that you can run this

73
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,379
locally at home if your student startup

74
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,840
a researcher doesn't matter too much and

75
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,060
you can run this 24 7 you're not ending

76
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,099
up with a high electricity bill because

77
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,800
it's just a small device

78
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,959
and you also don't need to pay a lot of

79
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,540
money to either obtain it or something

80
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,640
similar

81
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,959
and I want to talk about the traffic

82
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,640
light protocol because I feel like this

83
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,920
is one of the biggest caveats that

84
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,200
people in the well in the industry or

85
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,560
want to get into the industry have now

86
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,879
for those unaware the traffic light

87
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,000
protocol or top is often what's how you

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,980
rate your information so if I were to

89
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,739
make this talk TLP red which is the

90
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,599
highest rating it would mean that it

91
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,220
wouldn't be recorded and you would not

92
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,099
allow be allowed to well the information

93
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,140
should never leave this room obviously

94
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,000
it does when you leave the room but

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,500
you're not allowed to say hey Max gave

96
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,140
this talk about you can only vaguely

97
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,720
reference it and use it now there's more

98
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,519
information about this on top of my head

99
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,720
I believe the TLP is from the first

100
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,400
organization at least they have

101
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,620
documentation on it and you have

102
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,780
information that ranges from Top clear

103
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,000
which is just information you can find

104
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,720
on the web and anything between red and

105
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,599
clear there are several versions now in

106
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,060
my work at relics there is information

107
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,580
that I don't publish as soon as I get it

108
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,399
I use that prime example being the RTM

109
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,680
blog that I had I've been sitting on

110
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,779
that for quite some time to do more

111
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,880
research and not get that into the

112
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,440
public because getting it into the

113
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,720
public does mean informing other

114
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,199
analysts and helping the security

115
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,120
industry as a whole but also means that

116
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,340
an actor can read that blog and simply

117
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,139
change their malware update it or fix

118
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,120
anything I point out

119
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,040
however if you're learning if you're

120
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,080
just starting out you don't need the

121
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,300
secrecy around it you can reuse anything

122
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,520
that's online available if you just

123
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,500
assume that whatever you're doing is

124
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,660
okay to be shared with the world if

125
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,100
you're new to more analysis and you're

126
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,380
just how does ransomware work you don't

127
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,880
need your sample to stay hidden for

128
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,560
months because very likely you're

129
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,120
already basing your work on a public

130
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,699
sample so if you assume that your

131
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,740
information doesn't need to be to remain

132
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,759
Secret

133
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,860
or your samples don't need to mainly in

134
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,500
secret you can have a wide variety of

135
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,740
tools at your disposal that you can use

136
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,540
now

137
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,240
for the pipeline itself obviously in the

138
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,800
end you need to do manual analysis right

139
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,139
you need to verify your results one way

140
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,039
or another and that's why in here you do

141
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,080
not focus on the malware analysis on the

142
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,900
manual analysis yet

143
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,280
that will come later but for now you

144
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,740
want to just make a rough shift between

145
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,060
what's interesting what's not

146
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,580
interesting to you so there could be

147
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,259
anything that's malicious it could be a

148
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:41,639
very specific thing

149
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,180
now the community itself makes a lot of

150
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,580
rules and patterns for you to work with

151
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,639
ranging from Yara rules to any other

152
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,919
kind of detection you can work with and

153
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,840
set up locally

154
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,080
so you can reuse this learn from both

155
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,419
what you see but also apply it which

156
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,960
gives you practical experience as well

157
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,699
but there's no need for you to make

158
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,440
everything on your own and reinvent the

159
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,820
wheel

160
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,020
so

161
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,440
the understanding of getting this this

162
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,960
data and using it doesn't mean that you

163
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,360
need to have a beefy hardware setup you

164
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,240
can simply scale by Outsourcing and if

165
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,979
you Outsource to a cloud service that

166
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,259
you rent that can be really expensive

167
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,240
but you can also Outsource to cloud

168
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,160
services that provide this information

169
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,500
for you and that gives you two

170
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,759
advantages

171
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,280
if you use such services and you have

172
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,259
that information you share it again with

173
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,000
the community so you give back to the

174
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,340
community that you also take from if you

175
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,100
will but also you use the resources that

176
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,600
they offer

177
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,800
we'll get to that in a minute

178
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,139
so we're talking about resources but the

179
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:53,400
resources we're using to do something

180
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,660
we're going to collect something and

181
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,419
what are we going to collect

182
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:58,740
there are an overwhelming number of

183
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,000
fresh samples if you take premium sample

184
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,280
feeds and just look at what they produce

185
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,240
daily

186
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,639
if you're just getting out there and

187
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,680
want to learn how to do malware analysis

188
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,419
you don't need all the fresh samples in

189
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,280
the world you technically only need one

190
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,020
now the problem is how do you get that

191
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,639
one sample that you're interested in and

192
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,800
that is interesting you need more

193
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,660
samples because if you knew exactly what

194
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,479
you needed from the get-go you have a

195
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,460
magic crystal ball and would probably be

196
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,500
better off buying a lottery ticket that

197
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,120
is the winning ticket

198
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,380
so

199
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,840
you don't need that but what you do need

200
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,199
is some samples to base on Trends see

201
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,940
what is out there and

202
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,080
just

203
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,460
uh ride in between search what you need

204
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,639
now if you use let's say public services

205
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,220
for this you have services such as Mall

206
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,319
share which provides some metadata on

207
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,900
files but also free access you can do

208
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,080
2000 API requests per day and as I

209
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,819
stayed in the top of the slides please

210
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,580
adhere to rate limits and fair use so

211
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,940
some of the services have a number of

212
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,880
requests you can make don't make 2 000

213
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,099
threads and launch them all at once at

214
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:15,360
Mile share just be be conservative and

215
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,039
think of others that would like to use

216
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,500
the servers as well then there's for

217
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,479
example malware Bazaar you need a

218
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,039
Twitter account which is free and you

219
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,759
can use any data you want to register

220
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,539
or is it freeze kind of hot topic now

221
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,760
but uh you can contact the service

222
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,099
afterwards with it and there's the API

223
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,860
rate limit on this so you cannot really

224
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,958
spam it but they allow for example to

225
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,179
download recent samples of the last day

226
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,640
or last hour that you can fetch

227
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,519
periodically and then use locally

228
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,339
and then there's melpedia Daniel I gave

229
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,339
a talk earlier today he's won until I

230
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:54,420
had one of the founders or at least

231
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,820
moderators there so if you're here and

232
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,240
you would like an invite and

233
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,160
I'm just going to say that yeah okay

234
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,040
he's nodding yeah you can come to him uh

235
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,779
so maybe that's a busy Gala for you

236
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,399
tonight

237
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,140
you do need a vouch from an existing

238
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,700
member or I think you need to meet

239
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,620
Daniel who is obviously an existing

240
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,600
member but they have a mower Corpus that

241
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,399
he explained as well so they have a

242
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,820
public library of blogs and resources

243
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,500
that you have but you can also find

244
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,959
malware once you have a registered

245
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,380
account and they have unpacked unpacked

246
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,019
versions of the malware they have coming

247
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,060
back into the traffic light protocol top

248
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,220
clear rules on the website just publicly

249
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,380
available but you have more rules once

250
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,120
you're registered which you can use for

251
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,800
scanning Etc

252
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,160
and then there's the sandbox uh triage

253
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,959
I think it's now part of recorded future

254
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,300
they got bought but there's free access

255
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,640
for non-commercial usage so individual

256
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,480
resource researchers can use that and

257
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,040
the sandbox itself allows you to do

258
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,440
Dynamic execution on scale but they also

259
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,399
have configuration extractor extracting

260
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,440
capabilities so you can Harvest those as

261
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,540
well from samples now if you were to

262
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,000
combine all this

263
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
uh you'll have your local setup so you

264
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,860
attach some external storage or you have

265
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,560
a big SD card in your Raspberry Pi or a

266
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,480
machine you can store the samples and

267
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,399
you can store your metadata in a

268
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,320
database so you don't need to query the

269
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,440
API every time and again

270
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,720
you can use a folder structure which

271
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,339
works for you for the sample so let's

272
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,740
say you have a year month and day where

273
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,080
you can realize when you fetch something

274
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,660
which allows you to easily delete old

275
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,339
data so if you have a 60-day retention

276
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,440
period you can just delete the folder

277
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,560
you can also do it for a year and then

278
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,200
the day of year so day one day two day

279
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,839
three just to keep track of how old your

280
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:50,640
data is and depending how much you want

281
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,560
to save

282
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,959
as for detections you want to optimize

283
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,000
your URLs Dominica gave a good talk

284
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,800
about that today as well as last year

285
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,839
the last year one is already on YouTube

286
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,480
and this one will be on YouTube in the

287
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,000
future as will this talk be and you can

288
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,940
upload the scanning to your public

289
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,760
platform such as yarify erfi is also

290
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,160
part just like malware Bazaar from

291
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,700
abuse.ch and you can upload your Yar

292
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,260
rules there but you can also upload

293
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,060
samples which are then scanned not only

294
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,519
for your rules but others and if

295
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,560
somebody else has a rule that triggers

296
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,860
they'll get an alert too so it benefits

297
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,680
the whole community

298
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,600
and then for the malware and uh for the

299
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,880
manual malware analysis you have several

300
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,339
tools listed in well no particular order

301
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,940
here so you have jira which I personally

302
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,339
find very useful uh you have cutter

303
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,260
which is based on ryzen but then with

304
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,120
the GUI or ryzen if you prefer the

305
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,880
command line interface Ida free or home

306
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,740
which is about a dollar a day I think

307
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,399
for the license and those are meant

308
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,640
mainly for let's say native binaries so

309
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,220
CEC plus plus rust Gold Line but if you

310
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,779
have something in dotnet you can use the

311
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,700
free and open source tool the inspirex

312
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,160
and for Java on Android you can use jedx

313
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,779
obviously there are more tools this is

314
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,959
not an exhaustive list but once you find

315
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,959
something that your rules match on and

316
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,820
you don't need a rule necessarily for a

317
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,980
specific family but you can also look

318
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,500
for specific techniques and binaries you

319
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,440
can look into the binary so you've gone

320
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,100
from having not to pay a lot I would

321
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,339
argue to collect your malware do the

322
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,500
detections on the scale get a lot of

323
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,740
metadata do the sandbox execution and

324
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,959
this mimics what a lot of companies have

325
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,600
in a house but then not outsourced to

326
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,980
public platforms where you share

327
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,839
everything but if you want to do this as

328
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,100
a learning experience that's really

329
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,519
helpful

330
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,380
so what you can still do to further

331
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,360
automate is you can run some tools

332
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,980
headless so let's say you have an

333
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,420
interesting file and you were to use

334
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,399
gdra you can use Gita headless to do the

335
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,500
analysis for you you then set up a

336
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,779
notification when it's done so by the

337
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:05,519
time you get out of the shower or you

338
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,380
are done doing groceries you can

339
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,480
directly get behind your computer open

340
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,220
jidra and you don't even need to wait

341
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,100
for the initial analysis to start which

342
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,800
I guess saves you even more time

343
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,500
especially if you have a lack of time

344
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,720
now resources do not reinvent the wheel

345
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,980
and this is where the Shameless

346
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,560
self-promotion comes in I have a website

347
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,300
where I have a free Binary binary

348
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,639
analysis course which guides you step by

349
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,740
step along the way where I try to

350
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,660
explain why certain steps are taken

351
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,600
rather than just that they are taken

352
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,740
um

353
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,260
use API client libraries that you have

354
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,720
available I have a few on my website but

355
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,820
I do know that I am one of the very few

356
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,420
who prefers Java so if you I see

357
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,300
somebody in the audience calling ah

358
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,639
if you like Java then these are for you

359
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,500
but I mean if you search on on Google

360
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,980
for let's say malware Bazaar python

361
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,680
client you'll find one so that saves you

362
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,060
a lot of time as well if you want to set

363
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,500
something up and automate you don't have

364
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,839
to do everything on your own and you can

365
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,399
collaborate with the community maybe you

366
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,839
can make a rule when somebody else as

367
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,040
well and then suddenly you've covered

368
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,079
two families instead of one and if you

369
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:16,139
think of this on a bigger scale then you

370
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,000
can do even more

371
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,820
so those are some resources I'll tweet

372
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,500
some links out as well probably before

373
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,639
the gala after the lightning talks

374
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,420
if you have any questions or tips then

375
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,880
feel free to reach out on any of these

376
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,459
Twitter Macedon or LinkedIn

377
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,560
and

378
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,660
I hope you will enjoy the lightning

379
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,310
talks in Gala

380
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:50,519
[Applause]

381
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,199
okay we can take one question

382
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:59,300
come on

383
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,100
then it was either very clear or very

384
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,199
unclear

385
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:08,120
we'll go with that with being clear

386
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,980
okay thank you

387
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,518
