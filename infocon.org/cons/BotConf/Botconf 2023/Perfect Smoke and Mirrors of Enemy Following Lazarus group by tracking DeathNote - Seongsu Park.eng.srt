1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,040
uh my name is I'm from South Korea the

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,480
country of BTS skid game and suno mean

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,179
as well and so yeah I'm very excited in

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,240
here I'm used to my first time to have a

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,940
Opera in conference after the pandemic

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,279
so I'm so excited and just a little

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,160
nervous and in my talk as I know

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,019
historically the both confused talk

9
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,560
about the Bonnet Crimea and some Crimea

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,019
ecosystems but in my talk it's not a

11
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,840
primary stuff it's not about net related

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,719
experience but I would like to share my

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,780
experience about the tracking one apt

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,899
set actors and as you know the APT actor

15
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,000
and the cyber crime group they use the

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,879
not that much different techno so I hope

17
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,200
this contents will be useful for you

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,440
and let's start before moving on let me

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,719
introduce myself very briefly I'm

20
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,699
working in caspersky and Global Research

21
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,160
and Analysis team as a beauty security

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,199
researcher and I'm the only one who can

23
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,020
speak Korean in our team so I usually

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,020
tracking the Korean speaking takers like

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,979
uh Lazarus

26
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,159
and not only the Korean apt actors are

27
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,000
tracking the uh

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,340
focus on the Apec Vision so that's what

29
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,619
I did and

30
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,680
then let's talk about this APD actors

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,759
named the letters and I think to all of

32
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,799
the people in this room already heard

33
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,400
about this group and they are notorious

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,060
famous AP texture these days and they

35
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,860
also known as the hidden Cobra watching

36
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,780
by other vendors and

37
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,860
this vendor was published in 2014 by the

38
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,380
operation Blockbuster published by the

39
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,220
Nobita and other Alliance and from that

40
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,500
report to operation Blockbuster many

41
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,060
security vendors start to call this

42
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,700
group as a Lateralus and this group has

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,460
a many main objectives of their Cyber

44
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,719
attack the first one is a financial

45
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,758
Gathering using their Cyber attack

46
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,520
capability they attacked many Financial

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,319
institutes to get their money and

48
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,599
support their government and the other

49
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,000
purpose is cyber Espionage and the data

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,379
set and I can show you some

51
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:24,260
cases later so they attacked some

52
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,400
manufacturing sometimes they want to

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,959
steal some

54
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,239
government intelligence from other other

55
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,920
countries

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,020
and

57
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,959
when I just uh start to attracted this

58
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,379
group so almost uh 10 years ago but they

59
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,959
just using the small small set of

60
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,019
malvers it seems like they just operated

61
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,879
a small number of people behind the

62
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,760
mobile but these days they are growing

63
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,459
they now they are realized that they're

64
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,700
taken on so many profits from the cyber

65
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,980
attacks so nowadays they operate many

66
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,780
clusters and we tracking them as a or a

67
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,720
fiber cluster of their attacks and one

68
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,819
of them I introduced one of their

69
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,120
clusters we call the decimals

70
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,940
and this is the beginning after the Sony

71
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,220
Pictures Entertainment hacking maybe you

72
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,440
guys already heard about that attack the

73
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,480
Sony Pictures Entertainment to order the

74
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,459
serious attack from the Lazarus group

75
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,000
and we checked the malware called the

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,580
manuscript this is the old larger

77
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,200
smallware connected to the Sony Pictures

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,659
Entertainment hacking and they had to

79
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,900
use this model for several years without

80
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,440
significant change but uh in the only

81
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,159
over the 2019 I came across some updated

82
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,840
version of a downloader from this

83
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,799
malware from the virus total so it is it

84
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,540
that download implemented a new

85
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,720
technique so I started to use that I

86
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,640
start to name that Mario cluster layer

87
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,159
so differently and keep tracking of the

88
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,680
malware so I start to call them that's

89
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,580
not and I I showed why name this model

90
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,980
is a decimals

91
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,080
and this is the beginning of the

92
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,019
tracking the desert clusters until this

93
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,560
time in October 2019 this Lazarus group

94
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,540
only attacking the cryptocurrency

95
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,579
exchange it was still the money so

96
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,680
they're just using some this kind of

97
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,979
equal document or Ripple project some

98
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,740
cryptocurrency

99
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,479
questionary all of the decoy document

100
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,000
contains some cryptocurrency related

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,180
information and they send some malicious

102
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,880
document to the victim including some

103
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,240
malicious Visual Basic script in it and

104
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,699
the other initial intention Vector they

105
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,240
use this toronize the application they

106
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,620
made us internalize the application

107
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,979
impersonating some cryptocurrency

108
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:56,460
exchanging from Trading applications and

109
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,040
also this infection Vector created some

110
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,040
same model that malware was a kind of

111
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,740
downloader and this downloader has the

112
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,100
name of the dm.dll or dn64.dll

113
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,500
so I just searched this name again and

114
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,080
from the Google and try to find some

115
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,960
full name and I find out the Death Note

116
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,300
is so I just start to call the desktop

117
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,660
cluster but I I the mid is a terrible

118
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,360
naming scheme and sometimes uh to make

119
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,720
make us some Warriors naming is a way

120
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,780
more than you know difficulty than the

121
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,820
view of the engineering so I just maybe

122
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,580
that's not in this downloader has a

123
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,860
simple function just to send the

124
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,840
victim's information to the C2 server

125
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,800
and

126
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,080
fetch the next payload from the remote

127
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,479
servers and at in this attack they're

128
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,340
using the two kind of payload the first

129
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,580
one is tronize the ultravagancy this

130
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,460
just looks like a queen's client but it

131
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,900
has a full featured back to our

132
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,940
functions and the other infection Vector

133
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,340
was the it included multiple binary

134
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,500
infection procedures you can see the

135
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,780
this downloader patch the installer and

136
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,340
installer

137
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,759
created the injector in the disinject

138
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,380
injects the real malicious payload on

139
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,100
the legitimate process like explorer.exe

140
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,740
and until this time the back door was

141
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,720
the manuscript one we saw all the larger

142
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,300
smaller but we keep tracking of their

143
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,919
activities and from the April 2020

144
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,500
they start to shift their focus to the

145
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,900
defense industry and in previous day

146
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,280
attack only focused on the

147
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,220
cryptocurrency exchange but from

148
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,500
20 to earlier of 2020 they shift to the

149
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,440
focus to uh defense contractors and at

150
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,479
this time they started using this kind

151
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,240
of decoy document about job description

152
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,919
from defense industry you can see the

153
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,160
Boeing ba system or lock the Martin

154
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,220
and so some vendor name this operation

155
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,460
as a operation dream job so very good

156
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,160
name is key my name is Kim zabet but

157
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,440
they are very good neighbors kids and at

158
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,240
this time they started using the remote

159
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,419
template injections and the other

160
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,240
infection Vector I I it is a really

161
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,819
interesting for me that they created

162
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,460
some tronized PDF reader based on the

163
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,160
fully open source it's a Sumatra PDF

164
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,780
reader you can find it from the Google

165
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,479
it's a public source so Lazarus group

166
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,819
downloaded that PDF application source

167
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,160
and injects the malicious code in it and

168
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,400
make this pronunize the PDF provider and

169
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,620
if the victim just opened the PDF file

170
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,960
using this application it works well

171
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,680
it's a like a normal PDF reader file but

172
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,759
when

173
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,819
some captive when this tries the PDF

174
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,699
reader open the crafted PDF file it

175
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,360
works differently first when every time

176
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,419
when this PDF application opens the PDF

177
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,180
file it checks the nd5 hash and using

178
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,639
that md5 hash it secretes the embedded

179
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,580
configuration in this PDF application

180
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,160
and firstly check the header you can see

181
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,319
the header

182
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,280
46 E2 and if it is this header is mesh

183
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,419
it compare the embedded nd5 hash it will

184
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,340
open the PDF file

185
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,979
and finally if if it is match they

186
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,919
extract the volt byte key inside it and

187
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,039
decrypt the PDF decoy PDF file and the

188
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,220
next payload inside it which means the

189
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,400
only destroys the application open this

190
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,399
crafted PDF file it works like a

191
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,140
malicious behavior

192
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,799
so if the mobile operator want to change

193
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,479
the receipt to server they just made

194
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,479
that is another craft

195
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,580
circulatory and if they open it they

196
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,920
connect to another server so it's a very

197
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,320
clever way I think and Lazarus groups

198
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,060
still use this kind of a technique very

199
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,899
often

200
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,180
and finally the downloader more we have

201
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,880
created and it Fetch and execute to the

202
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,339
model on the memory only in the memory

203
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,519
it's a they heavily use the reflective

204
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,380
loading techniques like a cyber crime

205
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,959
group also used often but not just

206
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,119
groupers also use the kind of techniques

207
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,180
and another Finding was

208
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,760
happened in June 2021

209
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,339
I found this case from the south square

210
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,839
of 18 they were Think Tank and they

211
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,360
usually research about North Korean

212
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,720
related policy and the government you

213
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,800
know decision

214
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,620
so it's very reasonable larger screw

215
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,560
attacked this you know think tank and

216
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,420
one interesting point is they also

217
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,640
created some downloadable memory it's a

218
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,560
start of the infection but this

219
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,019
downloader malware was created by the

220
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,660
legendary software so I have some

221
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,940
interesting at that time so I look into

222
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,399
that what is that software is a

223
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,060
ironically is a security software and

224
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,980
this security software created them

225
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,480
malware so it's a little ironic so

226
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,980
uh we cannot find the exact uh reason

227
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,560
why this software to some malicious

228
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,100
behavior but when I search our Telemetry

229
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,640
the user connects some

230
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,279
suspicious website use website and after

231
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,800
that this legitimate software is created

232
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,680
and it created a malware so maybe I

233
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,560
believe the largest group find out some

234
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,100
vulnerability of this software and they

235
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,959
inject some delicious scripted on the

236
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,899
news site and they trigger that exploit

237
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,260
to deploy their malware in

238
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,500
in almost two years ago

239
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,500
and the same with the previous case that

240
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,720
they created a downloaded model and this

241
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,600
downloader executes the next payload

242
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,560
only on the memory with the kind of

243
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,060
command line parameter you can see the e

244
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,339
e Minister may be the increase and they

245
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,019
deliver the icpo key as well and

246
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,240
configuration bypass

247
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,360
and the memory on sorry the payload on

248
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,339
the memory was the blinding can malware

249
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,620
blinding can you can search the blinding

250
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,200
can it was published by the USA gisa

251
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,540
before and you tested some full feature

252
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,459
of the back doors and using this

253
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,339
blinding can they can control the video

254
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:23,040
only but the Blazers group delivered the

255
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,220
additional monitor at the time so they

256
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,399
deliver they this blinding came only

257
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,500
affects the additional malware and this

258
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,320
malware is cut with the the last one

259
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,360
command line parameters so you can see

260
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,440
that Windows GUI like parameters and the

261
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,420
thermometer checks the length of this

262
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,640
parameters and using this command line

263
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,700
parameter as the key to retrieve the API

264
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,100
hash or some embedded configurations so

265
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,519
if if I just uh get some malware from

266
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,640
the instant response you if I found some

267
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,640
loader malware then I if I had if I

268
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,040
don't have some key parameter let me

269
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,899
design parameters and I cannot Analyze

270
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,200
That Warrior so it's a very simple but

271
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,860
collaborate larger screw usually used

272
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,560
and so I have a many friends who do the

273
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,300
instant response in South Korea in the

274
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,000
day we really struggle with this kind of

275
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,740
Technical and

276
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,920
if I have only the test sample and I

277
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,279
submit the sample to the Center space

278
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,440
the behavior detection system it won't

279
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,720
detect it because it doesn't have that

280
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,839
key how many line is simple keys

281
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,180
so let's just group this kind of a tree

282
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,079
for a long time

283
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,000
and from the match

284
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,360
uh it's almost one years later

285
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,800
and I found that this cases from the

286
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,019
medical device and manufacture in South

287
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:58,920
Korea you know at that time in 2022 the

288
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,240
Apec vision

289
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,019
they start to spike the daily positive

290
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,899
infection number of copy 19. so that's

291
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,180
the reason maybe the largest groups

292
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,399
start to attack the medical device

293
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,339
company and in this case you can see

294
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,440
that the infection started from the

295
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,880
legendary software it's the same

296
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,519
software in previous one it's a almost

297
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,639
one year past but they still use the

298
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,120
same exploit in I think until this time

299
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,360
they some researcher or anyone can

300
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,160
figure out what is the exact

301
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,680
vulnerability of this software

302
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,620
so they start they keep using that kind

303
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,779
of vulnerabilities and they created some

304
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:43,940
downloader and in previous case they

305
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,519
execute some kind of known factual

306
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,700
memory on the memory but in this case

307
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,240
they switch their final payload in new

308
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,480
ones it's a it's not a complicated it's

309
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,880
just a simple the Mario connect to the

310
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,120
C2 server and the fetch some data maybe

311
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,339
it's a share code and is cut the share

312
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,380
code and return that visual to using the

313
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,959
name the pipe and backdoor send that

314
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,300
video to two documented control servers

315
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,940
so it's a very simple one but using this

316
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,000
Vector they execute a lot of command to

317
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,200
the victim and finally they

318
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,320
move directly and try to find some you

319
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,300
know value of information from the

320
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,060
beginning and in this case I figure out

321
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,700
some what kind of postage politication

322
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,779
they used

323
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,420
uh they use the mimikuts to steal some

324
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,880
login credential but when they're using

325
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,519
the mimic Cuts they using some custom

326
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,740
loader and use it by using the custom

327
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,680
loader they execute the mini cuts only

328
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,839
on the memory and extracts some login

329
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,459
credentials

330
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,380
and they also using the some kind of

331
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,040
standard they want to get some keystroke

332
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,680
and they want to get some flipple the

333
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,540
data from the beginning and this

334
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,540
distiller also one only on the memory

335
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,399
this is the

336
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,860
significant characteristic of larger

337
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,079
smaller they only learn the final

338
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,320
payload only on the memory so uh if we

339
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,440
get the loader where just if we get some

340
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,060
loader from the internet response it's

341
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,740
not easy to analyze the full information

342
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,220
chain

343
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,339
and the last case was happened on July

344
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,019
2022

345
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:29,639
and

346
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,100
in this case they attacked the defense

347
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,220
contractor in Africa region they were

348
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,300
some manufacturer of build some defense

349
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,240
system but because larger scrub attack

350
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,820
came with a malicious secure PDF

351
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,220
application it's kind of a patronize the

352
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,860
applications they people use but they

353
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,420
still use the very similar techniques

354
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,920
and

355
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,940
in this case the when the big team

356
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,199
executed these malicious 200

357
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:01,199
applications it created two files in the

358
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,060
same directory camera setting UI

359
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,959
host.exe and the dui70.tll file and the

360
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,300
first ESC file is the legitimate file

361
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,240
when execute this file it's just a load

362
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,940
the device 70. dlfi why don't you you

363
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,639
know it's a side loading techniques and

364
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,800
as I know the bolexity also published

365
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,720
about this technique and this technique

366
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,060
was used

367
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,680
operation apple juice cases by the

368
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,540
larger screw and it's the same technique

369
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,220
was used in this hotel when they

370
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,620
attacked the defense contractors

371
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,040
and in first infection case they created

372
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,779
some downloader and using this

373
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:39,180
downloader they created the same file

374
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,399
name in the same directory but at this

375
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,100
time it's a vector and they launched the

376
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,660
back door on the memory and they start

377
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,839
to do some expectation commands and

378
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,639
they also move laterally using this

379
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,639
backward and they are in for me it's a

380
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,459
very interesting packaging they using

381
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,980
some kind of service move technique I

382
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,420
never heard of these technique before

383
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,300
but I searched the Google and I found

384
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,760
that some read the team researcher

385
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,040
published about this technique when the

386
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,319
arbitrary file is created in the

387
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,299
perception simulation ordering the

388
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:16,500
system 32 and if the attacker launched

389
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,319
the processing simulation service

390
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,780
Windows service that service launched

391
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,579
any kind of arbitrary file in that

392
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:27,480
folder so the malware the operator just

393
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,940
created the

394
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,500
obj.dlfi and the processing simulation

395
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,740
folder and the executes the this window

396
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,860
service remotely then this module is

397
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,740
executed on the memory so it's very

398
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,440
simple but I'm I think it's not well

399
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,940
known techniques

400
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,919
I just uh I never heard of this

401
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:49,559
technique but uh several years ago

402
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,020
already to some Latin researcher publish

403
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,480
about this technique and they just adopt

404
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,299
the technique and use that from latest

405
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:00,080
cases

406
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,640
so yeah this is the

407
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,120
unical connector is too much it's just a

408
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,120
summary of a decimal cluster before the

409
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,059
2019 they usually attack the

410
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,799
cryptocurrency exchange with the old

411
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,179
model

412
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,660
but from the April 2022 they start to

413
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,280
shift their target to the defense

414
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,419
contractors

415
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:27,120
and they also attacked some software

416
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,059
vendor in Europe region that software

417
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,640
vendor created some Network and server

418
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,460
Monitoring Solutions but uh maybe the

419
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,340
larger screw want to abuse their supply

420
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,760
chain but as you can see the latest

421
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,340
k236s supply chain of the case they have

422
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,679
always have some interested in taking

423
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,480
the supply chain so

424
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,740
Maybe

425
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,900
attacking by this software vendor they

426
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,880
want to steal their source for the word

427
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,679
they all be using their supply chain

428
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,299
attack I think

429
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,820
and after that they using the Korea

430
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,220
local security software vulnerabilities

431
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,340
and start to spread their malware in

432
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,679
many companies in South Korea not only

433
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,960
think tank I just confirmed this Think

434
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,720
Tank was compromised but I seen the many

435
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,080
many many companies was compromised but

436
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,880
there is no positive exploitation

437
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,400
activity from the company because I

438
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,559
think the lateral group did not have an

439
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,600
interest about everything and which

440
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,720
means many big team was compromised from

441
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,900
the website like watering water but

442
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,179
larger screw only have interest about

443
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,460
the think tank and they do some they did

444
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,400
some kind of positive exploitation in

445
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,780
this city

446
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,059
and they also

447
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:45,360
attacked the medical device manufacturer

448
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,480
using the same technique as I said is uh

449
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,059
at this time the covid-19 was a serious

450
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,100
in Apex Vision including the South Korea

451
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,679
so maybe they want to steal some

452
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,679
intellectual property from Disney team

453
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,360
and they keep attacking the defense

454
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,419
contractor using the another technique

455
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,580
they as I said they adopt some service

456
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,820
move technique to move laterally so they

457
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,740
always searched some elaborative

458
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,620
technique to compromise the VT

459
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,440
and not only the binary infection chain

460
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,100
I for me personally I have many

461
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,559
interests about the postage polarization

462
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,260
phase

463
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,179
binary infection is not an end as you

464
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:33,539
know binary infection is implanting them

465
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:36,660
always just the start so using that kind

466
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,000
of back door this kind of Apt group

467
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,919
where cyber Crimes start to do some

468
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,820
positive rotation phase right so this

469
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,120
group does not have any you know

470
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,500
groundbreaking techniques but they're

471
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,480
using the this kind of attacking for the

472
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,700
basic Recon they using the Windows

473
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,880
command like a system info or nested or

474
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,880
pin or kind of there and sometimes in

475
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,980
one big team they read the activity

476
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,000
directory

477
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,059
uh uh defaults domain control of policy

478
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:09,059
which means the GPU policy directly and

479
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,880
figure out what kind of a policy used of

480
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,740
the BT

481
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,200
and to find a high value host like a

482
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,179
file server or active directory server

483
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:21,360
they using the nested Commander to

484
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,000
figure out the remote desktop host and

485
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,280
they also using the Ad Finder tool to

486
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,980
find the activity directory list and

487
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,080
what kind of AD directory they use and

488
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,880
what is the configurations

489
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,820
and for the credential access they using

490
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,580
the very well known tool mini Cuts but

491
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,600
they using the they use the custom

492
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,059
loader to execute these mini cuts and

493
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:47,280
they also using the responder to steal

494
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,260
some

495
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,760
low-incidental from the

496
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,260
Network base

497
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,419
and for the lateral movements they're

498
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:57,360
using the stolen credential from the

499
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,640
previous phase and they move laterally

500
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,340
using the SMB connection and as I say

501
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,380
they are using the service move

502
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,360
technique as well and for the

503
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,900
infiltration stay after still some big

504
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,900
fire from the victim they chop the fire

505
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,480
using the wind Rail and encrypts their

506
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,120
file using the custom password only they

507
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,179
know and start to send that file from

508
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:24,480
using their content control channels so

509
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,200
this is the whole infection

510
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,179
procedure I had to figure out until

511
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,880
you're tracking these groups

512
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,059
and this is the structure of the command

513
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,440
and control service

514
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,820
and I try to very working closely with

515
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,100
the local National assert and the

516
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,220
government agency to you know take down

517
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,520
their control servers so sometimes I had

518
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,840
a chance to look into their Community

519
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,799
Control servers so this is the common

520
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,880
structure of their comedian control

521
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,520
structures they usually figured

522
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,240
multiple stage comedy and control

523
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,039
Service First Stage was

524
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,400
uh Facebook malware and the towards the

525
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,020
stage you commit C to solver is

526
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,620
responsible for proxy it receives some

527
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,140
data from the malware and according to

528
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,880
that information to the second server

529
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,799
and received some command from the

530
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,440
second stage server and save the save it

531
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,900
to the file then the malware pulling

532
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,240
fetch the file from the first stage

533
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,380
itself

534
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,900
so it's a it's not it's just very simple

535
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,860
but I think it's very efficient to

536
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,320
operate it and body operator only using

537
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,200
the second stage server to verify the

538
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,960
victim and send the additional Commander

539
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,240
to the PT

540
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,960
and I in one commented control server I

541
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,179
found the I figured out the IP based uh

542
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:00,360
value validation script is responsible

543
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,780
for it contains more than 1000 IP

544
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,840
address in that script and it checks the

545
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,020
each client's IP address and these IP

546
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,419
address contain the whole big companies

547
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:14,820
in South Korea and the important

548
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,320
government agency in South Korea which

549
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,360
means that they already know the whole

550
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,700
IP address of their team so they just

551
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,580
filter the client using this kind of

552
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,100
script

553
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,500
so yeah it's very interesting and

554
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,960
and they configure This Server only

555
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,480
using the vulnerable website mostly

556
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,700
located in South Korea they're using

557
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,860
some bulletin board vulnerability where

558
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,380
some vulnerability of plugins and they

559
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,740
compromise their server and use that web

560
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,900
server as the commander control server

561
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,539
just a short period and the switch to

562
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:51,120
other one so they don't need to spend

563
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,940
their money to you know post a BPS or

564
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,700
cloud service they just use the volume

565
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,240
of solids so I think it's a very

566
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,659
efficient for those thread actors

567
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:07,500
and this is our attribution section

568
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,159
I think the many executed vendor also

569
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,559
some government agency already agreed

570
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,539
that

571
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:17,820
North Korea is behind the larger screw

572
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,200
and

573
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,659
we also tracked this group's activity

574
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:25,020
using through the many clusters and in

575
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,380
this slide I just uh extract some time

576
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,559
of a backdoor command delivered so which

577
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:35,000
means the they operate some

578
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,620
so malware operator is Q to their

579
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,419
command which means that they are real

580
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:42,539
working time so I just extracted the

581
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,880
time when they're delivered their back

582
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,120
to our commands so I extract the several

583
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,700
cases you can see

584
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,919
there are some kind of launch breaking

585
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,559
out of this time and when we consider

586
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:56,700
some

587
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,159
you know normal working time zone over

588
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,679
hours like hours and 9 Supply will work

589
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,980
10 to six it's like a day located in the

590
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,380
gmt8 version nine time zone

591
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,799
for your information the Southwest 29

592
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,059
and gmt8 plus 8 is a China

593
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:17,760
so maybe they physically located in this

594
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,159
region and in one comedian control

595
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,240
script

596
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,900
this is not a public Source it's just a

597
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,659
custom script from their current control

598
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:30,480
servers and I figure out some

599
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,820
Korean

600
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,580
comments like uh you there is which

601
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,900
means the

602
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,299
normal normal calling or normal

603
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:42,900
execution but they very familiar with

604
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,179
the Korean speaking so definitely they

605
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:48,500
are the Korean speaking groups

606
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,700
and yeah this is a conclusions this

607
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,279
group I just uh tracking the letters

608
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,440
group there are so many queer speaking

609
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,840
actors as you then expected there are

610
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,760
five or six Korean speaking actors and

611
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,220
larger screws are most active and most

612
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,279
uh difficult to attract because they

613
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,980
change it so quickly and they active

614
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,440
these days and

615
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,720
recently they are very persistent and

616
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,640
they increase the sophistications and

617
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,039
they they create the malware using the

618
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,860
open source they don't download their

619
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,480
options from the internet and they

620
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,720
inject some minimal minimal point of

621
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,539
their malicious code and compile their

622
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:32,940
malware so it's not easy to find the

623
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,419
malicious part of the malware they also

624
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:38,400
utilize some DLS side loading heavily

625
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,140
and they also use the bring your own

626
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,600
volano device technique as well and they

627
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,120
continue improve the technique to be

628
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,559
more sophisticated

629
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,679
so it's not easy to track them all these

630
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,559
days but I think the full context is

631
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,960
very important key to defense this kind

632
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,799
of attack

633
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,679
and heating one style defense is not

634
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,840
worth these days so we have to

635
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,000
understand the full context of Cyber

636
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,600
attack and diversify our you know

637
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,840
defense point is a key of this stage and

638
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,179
the reason that I can understand their

639
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:14,940
host exploitation and comment and

640
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,760
control server is the cooperation with

641
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,640
the other industry like sometimes I have

642
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,760
the meeting sometimes I cooperate with a

643
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,419
local agency or local National search so

644
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,700
each sector has a different strength is

645
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,380
that sector has a different visibility

646
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,520
so cooperation is essential to cope with

647
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,980
this kind of very latest Cyber attack

648
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,520
cases

649
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,039
and yeah I think it's just a 30 minute

650
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:44,880
so

651
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,080
I'm I'm sure for someone is not it's not

652
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,900
sufficient you need more details but I

653
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,659
think that I just checked just to jump

654
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:56,700
on the stage we already published our

655
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,700
blog in our secure list today so you can

656
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,740
check the blog and you can find the more

657
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,620
details and some hashes and I'll be

658
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,720
around here so if you need more

659
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,440
information if you want some

660
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,880
instance then I can share it and just

661
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,820
hit me up and I can share you know what

662
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,320
I find that you can discuss more about

663
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,419
these groups well thank you for your

664
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:21,500
attention thank you

665
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,539
any questions

666
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:33,059
don't don't fly away

667
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:35,700
I just try to run it but I

668
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,799
you catch me

669
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:40,020
any questions in the room

670
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,559
yeah

671
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,340
can you maybe elaborate a little bit on

672
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,799
the factors you take into account to map

673
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:58,320
those particular attacks into the same

674
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,399
cluster like just uh list them or talk a

675
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,440
little bit about it

676
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,100
uh it's domain is it C2 structures or

677
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,559
what do you use you mean the why I

678
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,600
clustered them yeah so you said you have

679
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,179
four clusters and those attacks you map

680
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:17,700
to this Death Note Buster why would yeah

681
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,440
that I I

682
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,380
uh to be honest time it's not easy to

683
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,039
cross them but I I start to Cluster this

684
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:29,039
model based on the downloader Mario I

685
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,000
meant tn.tlfi and if this downloader

686
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,039
first positional payload I

687
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,860
cross them at the one cluster

688
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,100
and based on the technical difference I

689
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,500
try to find some

690
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,520
uh I try to diversify their technical

691
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,039
difference but sometimes I check the

692
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,360
comment and control server

693
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,419
configurations and also find out some

694
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,880
based on the characteristics of malware

695
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,919
and

696
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:03,240
actually I two years ago I uh I present

697
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,179
about this kind of cluster in

698
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:08,039
another conference I don't want to

699
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,020
mention that conference name but you can

700
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,299
search the my name then you can find

701
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:15,179
that contents and there's some cluster

702
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:17,279
and why we collected a kind of cluster

703
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,220
for war five and and actually one of the

704
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,980
several of that cluster was fabricated

705
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,500
they never used that cluster anymore but

706
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,380
someone is the and they have a many

707
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,020
overlaps so it's not easy to close them

708
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,799
all but I try to best it to find out

709
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,260
many you know trying to

710
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,779
make a cluster them based on their

711
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:41,700
technical differences like

712
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,840
yeah

713
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,299
I hope you can find that

714
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:47,760
another comprehensive material and

715
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,919
figure out that yeah answers

716
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,840
that's it thank you good question

717
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:02,640
one two three uh last one

718
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,880
yeah

719
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,480
hello emotion when legitimate

720
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,760
executable that was used as a initial

721
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,779
vector

722
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:15,120
do you really don't know what it is or

723
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,159
you don't want to say it

724
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:19,559
uh

725
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,539
actually it's a very critical one in

726
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,659
South Korea now so many

727
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:26,720
who Consultants

728
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,980
Asian agency

729
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,039
engaged to investigate it but I

730
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,659
understand that it's not easy to figure

731
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:35,700
out what kind of exploit they use

732
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,700
because they use that kind of volatility

733
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,100
very short period just just a several

734
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,340
seconds and disappear so many vendor and

735
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,559
the local cert is a

736
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,020
is not to find a figure out what is the

737
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,820
exact root cause of that vulnerability

738
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,120
so I don't want to mention that but

739
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,360
if you find me in the around here I can

740
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,640
say

741
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,960
yeah list

742
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,740
yeah just a text message then yeah

743
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,960
okay thank you very much thank you
