1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,840
me cool

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,819
okay and

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:06,600
um

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,300
so we have a timer here

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,400
well I'm sorry I don't have two screens

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,759
and so on but uh they see it

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,220
yep

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,440
and let's go

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,400
okay oh four minutes okay I'll take it

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,439
so everyone uh so I don't have a lot of

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,300
time but I wanted to talk to you about a

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,539
new tool that I did a few weeks back I

13
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,279
was actually doing some beer viewer

14
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,820
analysis and I was using progdot to

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,160
analyze my proc man file is exports in

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,579
CSV and I thought it was

17
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:45,000
needing some performance issues and Etc

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,719
and I wanted to learn rust so I coded a

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,420
tool which uses story which is a

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,280
cross-platform desktop application

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,039
building tool with rest in the back end

22
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,039
and JavaScript or any framework in the

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,500
front end so it's called platform and

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,860
the goal is to export your Brockman data

25
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,020
that can be millions of lines if you

26
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,479
want and when you have run your malware

27
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,240
sample and just recorded the activities

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,540
with Brockman you can just export this

29
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,740
in CSV and imported it into Vision

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,880
program

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,560
so

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,320
um I will just give you a quick demo

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,339
and now let's go

34
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,079
okay so

35
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,119
um the way that it works once you fire

36
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,820
up the application is that you just give

37
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,659
the full path of the CSV and then you

38
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,520
just click on load and this is

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,799
approximately one million lines and you

40
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,140
see that because it's trust it's going

41
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,420
quickly and

42
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,659
so I have to take a sample of one of the

43
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,360
latest cue boats malware campaign that

44
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,619
is using OneNote malicious files and so

45
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,619
I will analyze this process now

46
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,660
so you can see this visualization tools

47
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,840
propose you few things and we can see

48
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,040
that the OneNote process started the

49
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,280
mshta.txe which started to other process

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,319
or curl.exe and then the run32.dlr

51
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,780
so if you click on the register key

52
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,400
creation you are going to be able to

53
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,200
visualize all the resistor key created

54
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,080
we can see this file is this registry

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,680
key is very suspicious so we can see if

56
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,980
there is any set values for this project

57
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,480
really key

58
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,420
and we see that there is one and you can

59
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,220
see the details here so it's actually

60
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,519
some data obfuscated to execute the

61
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:51,599
JavaScript

62
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,940
and then you can see the registry key

63
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,459
deletion deleted values and do some

64
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,440
correlations you can see the steps here

65
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,959
so you can see there is a registry key

66
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,620
creation here then is delete it later if

67
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,800
we click on for example curl.txe

68
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,400
we see that curl is used to fetch a fake

69
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,420
PNG file and then being an executed

70
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,859
later using run 32dll

71
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,450
and I have no time so thank you

72
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:32,649
[Applause]

73
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,080
hello hello

74
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,040
hi thanks for sticking around and

75
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,140
listening to lightning talks so I'm

76
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,860
going to talk about desk group again

77
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,260
um this is who I am so I've been working

78
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,199
for a Twist post for almost 16 years in

79
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,680
a couple months and I also added our

80
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,500
team's Twitter handle to the slide so

81
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,780
um I've been a regular speaker here I've

82
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,419
given a five presentations and this is

83
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,240
my fourth lightning talk the last couple

84
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,060
were about desktop group as well so that

85
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,020
first presentation was in 2019

86
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,240
and hear a little bit history about

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,160
desktop group we started tracking them

88
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,940
over five years ago in early 2018.

89
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,479
and just in November last year uh group

90
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,479
IB published a report after some

91
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,759
collaboration

92
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,500
and they were holding it back for over a

93
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,139
year so finally it's out

94
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,560
and I updated my blog post to include a

95
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,720
download link where you can get the PDF

96
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,120
report without having to give it to give

97
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,699
out your email address or your details

98
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,979
so you can just go to my blog and

99
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,740
download the PDF look at the blog

100
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,440
they wrote and the webinar I also added

101
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,199
some aliases for this group as well I

102
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,020
haven't added the blue bottle from Simon

103
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,800
Tech blog from earlier this year

104
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,160
but that's another Alias that's very

105
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,820
likely related to this group

106
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,039
the report has some nice overview about

107
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,020
how the organization and the attacks

108
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,919
work

109
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,759
they're using vpns beer fishing and mule

110
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,600
mule accounts to cash out the money

111
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,580
there are some nice key findings as well

112
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,979
they've done more than 30 attacks they

113
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,199
stole more than 30 million

114
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,060
money in 15 countries they're likely

115
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,680
originated from a french-speaking

116
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,479
country in Africa

117
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,180
and most of their attacks have been to

118
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,100
french-speaking countries in different

119
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,380
continents

120
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,560
so here the takeaway or the recipe how I

121
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,699
did it

122
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,759
um so aggressively block all the email

123
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,160
attachments that could be malicious and

124
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,860
then also to malware analysis on those

125
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,039
samples from quarantined emails and

126
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,840
track malware families and C2

127
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,479
infrastructure correlate look at

128
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,539
targeting at email headers as well share

129
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,400
and collaborate I created my own

130
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,900
research group there's about seven

131
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,900
peoples here at this conference and find

132
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,759
a name your own thread groups that

133
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,699
matter most to you and who all is doing

134
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,940
this

135
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:54,139
raise your hand who all is doing this

136
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,100
just a few

137
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,520
well here's the recipe so go ahead start

138
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,380
doing that

139
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:09,870
[Applause]

140
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,840
hello so one IP address has two country

141
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,780
locations so it's about geolocation of

142
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,000
IP addresses

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,400
so what is on if it's a cyber different

144
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,740
search engine we are specialized in

145
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,479
attack surface Discovery and attack

146
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,340
surface management

147
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,740
we collect many kind of data

148
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,720
for instance we collect who is data

149
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,000
which is uh the subject of this lining

150
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,180
talk

151
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,759
I have read an article about the

152
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,819
reciprocation of Ukraine Ukrainian RPP

153
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,699
registration basically

154
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:01,199
beginning March 2014 when Russia started

155
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,500
to invade some countries they updated

156
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,500
with records to remove the UA and

157
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,620
replace it with Ru and this can be found

158
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,000
in a historical who is records so the ID

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,300
here is an AP address maybe physically

160
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,280
in a country but logically registered

161
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,940
somewhere else

162
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,259
so it's important to to keep track of

163
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,379
The Logical relocation you can do that

164
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,599
with the release records and you have to

165
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,860
keep track also of the physical

166
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,240
relocation

167
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,399
you can obtain with Trace switching

168
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,979
basically by searching the last Hub and

169
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,979
you notifying where the last stop is

170
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,540
so both can be useful

171
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,959
and until today there was there is no

172
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,640
geolocation database where you have

173
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,140
access to both information

174
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,160
so we created a relocation database

175
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,680
IP info which is a great provider of

176
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,500
geolocation decided to make available

177
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,019
for free the link between a network

178
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,899
block and a physical country

179
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,180
so we could write correlate that with

180
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,459
who is Data so we can build Azure

181
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,560
location database with with data and add

182
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,860
just the physical information in the

183
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,940
generated file

184
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,820
and for instance in the article there

185
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,279
are some Network blocks attributed to

186
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,399
Ukraine and if we use the database we

187
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,160
clearly see for this ranges

188
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,880
they are from with records in Russia but

189
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,860
physically in Ukraine

190
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,620
social quiz is an IEP to two country

191
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,380
geolocation database you have access to

192
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,800
physical and logical locations and you

193
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,200
decide basically what is needed for your

194
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,420
use case sometimes you will prefer The

195
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,160
Logical ones sometimes the physical one

196
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,459
you decide it's a side project from anif

197
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,920
of course it will be integrated in onif

198
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,399
data and it's completely free there is

199
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,080
even no license you can connect on

200
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,860
julocus.io download the mmdb file or use

201
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,040
the IEP the API without registering at

202
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,540
all

203
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,920
thanks

204
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:31,990
[Applause]

205
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,839
hello everyone first I wanted to fix

206
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,940
something we talk about mimikats we talk

207
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,160
about mimisha only we have seen no

208
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,980
pictures of cattle already so this is

209
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,700
fixed so I made LeBlanc I'm a founder of

210
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,260
stemis networks and I'm working on

211
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,600
sericata and I'm a lazy guy because I'm

212
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,060
French

213
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,740
so we talked about this morning about

214
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,079
signatures

215
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,019
you need to do detection but it's not

216
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:13,500
easy as this guy State it's a bit

217
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,079
complicated because it comes from the

218
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,140
start age so 2000 and something so the

219
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,720
syntax is obscure on complex

220
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,540
and uh yes and you need to have

221
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,920
performances because we are talking

222
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,800
about probe that can be 10 gig or even

223
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,779
100 Gig so you need to be fast a bit

224
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,760
like with Yara you need to have

225
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,959
performance

226
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,300
uh so writing thing that you have can be

227
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,339
a nightmare uh you need to check the

228
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,200
syntax syntax is not easy then you need

229
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,640
to check the performance so that's

230
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,700
really a problem okay so I'm lazy as I

231
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,320
said so I had to automate this so I did

232
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,320
develop a language server that is using

233
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,480
that can be used a longer server

234
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,279
protocol is a standard developer in

235
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,700
Microsoft that allow a text editor an

236
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,660
IDE to discuss with a backend but know

237
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,240
about a long wedge so it's really open

238
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,519
there is one existing Fourier I did not

239
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,959
test it but it exists so

240
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:14,339
what you can do is to have syntax

241
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,500
checking when you are writing Rule and

242
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,540
you get Auto completion and you've got

243
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,300
also all optimization on performance int

244
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,160
so you know that the rule you are

245
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,620
writing are efficient and this is done

246
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,579
by integrate by asking Siri about the

247
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,200
um the fact that the rules are correct

248
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,240
or not and it has been tested with

249
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,180
Visual Studio novim gate for example

250
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,720
output so you can see a different alert

251
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,240
different syntax error on some intable

252
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,160
performance

253
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,680
and it also work on novem Airways show

254
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,339
the completion so you start to type

255
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,899
a keyword and when you get the

256
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,339
completion on the access to the

257
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:58,320
documentation so you can directly access

258
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,720
to the doc that's quite convenient

259
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,940
and uh yeah so if you want more

260
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,540
information about this uh you can just

261
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,120
download it from GitHub there is a

262
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,300
visual studio code plugin and

263
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,700
I also done a webinar explaining

264
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,620
everything but if you want to read about

265
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,079
this you can also use the shortcutter

266
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:20,579
for an ALICE book I've wrote with Peter

267
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:23,339
manf that explain all the error that you

268
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,200
can have in the shortcut language server

269
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,360
so you it will help you to write a

270
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,519
performance

271
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:31,860
circuit rules so don't hesitate to

272
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,139
contact me and I will be there

273
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,779
adversation tomorrow

274
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:39,040
and have a nice Gala

275
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:47,969
[Applause]

276
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,040
and today I will talk about Microsoft

277
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,800
graph API and how to use it to hide in

278
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,940
play sites

279
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,399
so the context I work for a French

280
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,940
commercial set and three weeks ago I

281
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,180
started an incident response the initial

282
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,920
intrusion was performed using an

283
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,420
unpatched appearance Exposed on the

284
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,120
internet and one week later the access

285
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,519
was sold again to another group that

286
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,079
performed the previous and the previous

287
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,600
was done fully in five hours

288
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,779
hopefully our clients got the attacker

289
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,639
during its laterization and his

290
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,980
establishment of persistence and for

291
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,720
once since the attack was really short

292
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,240
in time we had full visibility so let's

293
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,519
focus on things that we saw that were

294
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,699
quite interesting we saw a user and

295
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:44,760
rootkit and the initial patient and then

296
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,100
we saw a custom Beacon that was quite

297
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,959
funny to look at

298
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,339
so

299
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,339
um if you're a red team attacker

300
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:55,440
basically you're tired of having your IP

301
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,600
address or your domain blocked so how

302
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,880
can you improve you can use Microsoft

303
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,160
graph API for those who don't know the

304
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,740
graph API it's a way of providing access

305
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,680
to lots of Microsoft services and it's

306
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,019
really hard to block because everything

307
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,560
in the windows environment uses it

308
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,880
sometimes it's even whitelisted in

309
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,940
proxies so it's nice to use for C2

310
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,100
communication and this is what we

311
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,800
observed we observed the malware the

312
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,779
threat actor created the malicious Azure

313
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:28,019
tenant he used the Outlook and when wrap

314
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:31,380
subscriptions in the tenants as a dead

315
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,339
drop for commands and outputs so the in

316
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,380
fact is also worth the excuse discussing

317
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,600
with the malicious tenants through the

318
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,060
graph API and we were kind of hopeless

319
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,880
because it was impossible to block so at

320
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,440
that point we had to look for something

321
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,899
else and we discovered some of you may

322
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,420
you know it some of you may don't and

323
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,220
what is called the Microsoft tenant

324
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,980
restriction so the tenant restriction is

325
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,019
a security feature that is from

326
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,660
Microsoft basically it allows you to

327
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,839
prevent your people in your company to

328
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,060
authenticate on tenants that you don't

329
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,639
trust so what you do is when you perform

330
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,360
HTTP authentication on a tenant you can

331
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,660
add specific HTTP adders in the

332
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,779
authentication requests

333
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,399
dhtpaders will be a wait list of tenants

334
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,399
that you trust and Microsoft server is

335
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,740
in charge of Performing the verification

336
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,180
so in practice how do you use it it's

337
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,019
embedded in many proxy software like

338
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:36,839
zscaler firstpoint.com Etc what it does

339
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,120
is you perform SSL interception on

340
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,759
outgoing requests to Microsoft websites

341
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,120
and then you inject the HTTP Adder for

342
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,740
the tenant that you trust in the

343
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,899
outgoing request and everything is safe

344
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,930
again thank you

345
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:59,709
[Applause]

346
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,540
all right hello everyone if anyone gets

347
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,579
that reference please please please tell

348
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,959
me

349
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,459
so I'm going to be talking about

350
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,040
building well how I built my own redis

351
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,140
honey pot so whoops

352
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,720
so a month ago I read this article by

353
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,240
aquasex notice team about the headcrab

354
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,740
malware and I thought it was really cool

355
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,360
so

356
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,760
I built a honeypost to try and get

357
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,620
similar samples

358
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,960
so what is redis even though most of you

359
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,240
probably know it's a in-memory database

360
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,340
which is designed to be totally insecure

361
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,660
if exposed to the outside world and

362
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,660
that's anti-rise is the creator of redis

363
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,360
uh how does it work it's basically a

364
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,280
dictionary server but you can get keys

365
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,260
and set Keys it's it's pretty simple

366
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,660
how do you partner at a server well you

367
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,820
can either use like a Lua vulnerability

368
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,140
or CV you can use the config to set but

369
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,940
the contents of a file it's like an SSH

370
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,580
key or a web shell or you can use the

371
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,220
slave of and modulo load method

372
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,440
how does that work well an attacker

373
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,200
tells your Reddit server that it's a

374
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,140
slave to his malicious Reddit server so

375
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,900
your server clones the malicious service

376
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,600
database which isn't a database it's in

377
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,200
fact a backdoor so a shared Library

378
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,940
which you'll serve then loads and you

379
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,980
get code execution

380
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,380
so how does my proxy well how's my honey

381
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,320
pot work it's a proxy that logs just

382
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,780
everything and if it sees attack

383
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,640
patterns so the module load for example

384
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,100
it goes and gets the binary and saves it

385
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,559
somewhere and all the

386
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:46,740
well non-malicious traffic is sent to a

387
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,080
an actual Reddit server and while the

388
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,460
malicious one is just

389
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,419
returned with a with a fake response

390
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:59,160
so what results did I get uh

391
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,440
well I set it up in Pro yesterday at 3am

392
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,360
so I didn't get much

393
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,360
but that's not actually true whoops

394
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,580
that's not actually true because when I

395
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,799
woke up this morning I saw a lot of

396
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,980
stuff

397
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,960
so oops here the iuc's so all of those

398
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,880
are linked to already known campaigns so

399
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,820
the kisser dog and watchdog

400
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,919
yep that's going to be a lot of a lot of

401
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,240
malware done at least that's gonna be

402
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,140
fun

403
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,539
so yeah see you next year if some of

404
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:28,670
them I find is interesting

405
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:36,660
[Applause]

406
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,660
relationship

407
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,100
the room

408
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,440
so I run the next from the laptop and

409
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,660
today we'll talk about the udini Maria

410
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,299
family and more specifically about

411
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,240
Automation and of extraction and the C2

412
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,039
purine

413
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:17,100
so a bit of History Houdini is a VBS

414
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,280
based rat which started 10 years ago

415
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,320
and it's still active in all your days

416
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,820
yes

417
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,140
so there is a variance like duplicate

418
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,400
hhwat and others

419
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,340
so basically they all work the same so

420
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,559
you have an infinite Loop that requests

421
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,260
the C2 and then you have a switch case

422
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,320
to execute the correct orders

423
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,840
so to automate things first we need to

424
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,679
download samples for example using a

425
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,900
Vista type life earned based on your

426
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,740
rahul's and others well-known DBS like

427
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,320
to age or Maria bazaars

428
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,380
and for the extraction parts we will use

429
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,460
the windows VM that contains HTTP HTTP

430
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,120
proxy in it so when the samples request

431
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,960
the CDO we extract the user residents

432
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,340
from the requests and the user agent is

433
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,360
a Fingerprints of the victim's computers

434
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,160
so here we have a list of C2 URLs and

435
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,780
user agents

436
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:29,000
so no require we can create fake Bots

437
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,940
together recent orders from the C2 in

438
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,380
order to to get many payloads

439
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,380
so to do that we create a modular python

440
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,820
application

441
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,120
each blue squares represent a python

442
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,000
class that implements functions to

443
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,940
reports to the c2's orders

444
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,200
and we also have father son's

445
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,179
relationships so for example the wsh

446
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:00,120
ride V2 it reads from the double value

447
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,640
essential V1

448
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,440
and

449
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,020
there is examples of payloads and

450
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,179
samples

451
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:12,720
so as a result we have almost 1 000

452
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,500
boats lots of orders and sometimes when

453
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,159
we open C2 URLs in our browser we find

454
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,620
open directories that contains lots of

455
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,440
text files for share files and other

456
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,640
things

457
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,940
and the most useful orders are execute

458
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,900
ones

459
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,720
they mainly contain other rats

460
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,059
like Nando Coral bitrate engineer at

461
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:39,179
m-cos and sometimes more advanced

462
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:42,080
advanced payloads like Cobalt storage

463
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,250
thank you everyone

464
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:53,450
[Applause]

465
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,860
hey everybody uh before we start picture

466
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,860
of hand who's using streaming services

467
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,720
quite a few who's annoyed that some

468
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,799
regions have more content in other

469
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:08,880
regions

470
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,980
many people who knows about Geon

471
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,620
blocking through VPN providers many

472
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,720
people but who knows how they do that

473
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,480
hopefully no hands great

474
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,120
so this is my talk stranger vpns it's a

475
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,340
it's a paper I wrote recently with my

476
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,299
colleagues and this is a very short

477
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:25,919
lightning version of that

478
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,140
so we bought some VPN services for

479
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,460
different regions and we tried to see

480
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,039
how exactly The Germ blocking it's not

481
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,780
that easy because connections to Netflix

482
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,520
or Disney plus whatever they could

483
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,380
terminate it at the TLs proxy so your

484
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,299
TCP connection stops but the TLs stream

485
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:41,520
keeps on going through that means you

486
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,440
can't use ping or trace route to find

487
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,080
out any more information of that blob

488
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,179
where the data goes through but we found

489
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:50,039
a way to extract data and these are the

490
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:53,340
results it's a big graph of many uh

491
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,919
samples let's take a closer look for

492
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,080
example for surfshark we have two sub

493
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,059
graphs the top graph shows how many

494
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:01,860
unique IPS we encountered basically

495
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,679
roughly 2500 and the bottom graph shows

496
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,419
how many different autonomous systems we

497
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,240
found in this case only one color or two

498
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,919
on the right meaning we only have a few

499
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:12,780
asns

500
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,360
there's a different provider private VPN

501
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,280
they only use a few IP addresses and

502
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,260
only a few asms as well

503
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,960
this is pretty boring basically right I

504
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,179
should mention that these asns they are

505
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:25,919
sometimes fake companies that set up so

506
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,720
that's another doozy in any case

507
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,440
what about this we see many different

508
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,240
asns and I think most of us will

509
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,220
recognize what this means of course it's

510
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,020
residential proxies so here we see

511
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,539
cyberghost in Germany making use of many

512
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,520
different asns

513
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,159
or expressvpn also interesting to see is

514
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,200
the pattern for example in Japan

515
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,179
they use the orange single ASN for

516
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,400
amount of time then they skip to many

517
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,200
different as ends and then get back to

518
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,940
one again we don't know why they do that

519
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,799
seems to be economically feasible like

520
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,960
this

521
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,880
so we have two things basically we have

522
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,620
the fake providers and the residential

523
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,000
proxies

524
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,039
we collected data for aimed months

525
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,000
roughly and we found a 215 000 ipv4s and

526
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,360
uh roughly 2 million unique ipv6s all

527
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,760
numbers are unique and more than 2 000

528
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,740
different asns

529
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,940
some big providers from different

530
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,280
regions are of course in there

531
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,179
um

532
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:24,480
and yeah talk to me if you want to know

533
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,860
or sorry if you know where these

534
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,840
residential proxies come from because we

535
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,039
don't know

536
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,539
if you have more questions about the

537
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:33,720
paper or just want to talk in general

538
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,640
the full paper can be downloaded through

539
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,360
this QR link

540
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,620
yeah questions via email or in person

541
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,220
appreciate it thank you

542
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:52,069
[Applause]

543
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,679
oh sorry

544
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,320
uh hello everyone I'm dramatist I come

545
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,740
from breast and I'm here to well mainly

546
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,820
targeting French speaking people because

547
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,559
it is mainly a French speaking

548
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,520
conference it will be next November

549
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,179
um

550
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,240
so it's quite easy to get to you just

551
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,179
when you walk from here you just go west

552
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:30,840
till you arrive at Sea okay

553
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,460
um so yeah no a joke aside last year we

554
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,200
had 14 speaker 11 talks three workshops

555
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,260
and one attack defense CTF

556
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,140
um we are a bit late uh

557
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,720
no not late but well the cfp and

558
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,659
everything isn't open yet

559
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:56,039
um it's around 400 attendees and well

560
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,980
it's in a nice city well I live there so

561
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,919
so it's of course nice

562
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,559
um here are a few speakers from the

563
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,140
previous editions you may know some of

564
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,850

572
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,630
about it thank you

573
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:37,880
[Applause]

574
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,840
hello I'm Fred so I'm part of the

575
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,700
organizing committee and also security

576
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,880
researcher at data log so I will try to

577
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,340
sum up a presentation my colleagues did

578
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,039
a few weeks ago in three minutes

579
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,460
so it's about medicine software package

580
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,360
so mostly based on Pi Pi and npm so

581
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,039
quick definition what's malicious

582
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,799
software package attraction so initial

583
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,480
Vector code execution trigger code

584
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,400
execution mechanism and the final

585
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,080
objective

586
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,100
so what we would like to detect

587
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,600
so at first we want to detect for

588
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,460
example some type of squatting directly

589
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,640
available on on paypay some project

590
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,500
description so most of the time they can

591
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,179
be empty

592
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:26,340
uh we also want to detect what's

593
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,860
directly available in the source code so

594
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,260
once once you you do a P pen style for

595
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:35,279
example but also some writing of files

596
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,039
then executing it

597
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,500
and finally for example stealing cookies

598
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,880
and so on

599
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,940
so in order to do that we released the

600
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,220
recently gwapdog

601
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,440
so it's a fully open source and saved

602
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,320
contain the software it supports Pi Pi

603
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,320
and npm and we ingest source code and

604
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,140
package metadata

605
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,080
so that would metadata heuristics it's

606
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,779
written in Python and we just ingest all

607
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:06,539
the pipei fields and we get some

608
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,039
information about the packages

609
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:10,559
themselves

610
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,440
regarding source code analysis we are

611
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,539
using same grep which is an open source

612
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:19,020
tactical analysis tool and it's also

613
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,539
directly embedded in goward

614
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:24,419
so here we have some an example of the

615
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,279
same grade rules to a detect malicious

616
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:28,100
package

617
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,080
so we are also continuously scanning Pi

618
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,039
Pi

619
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,500
so just by using the Pi Pi feeds for

620
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,659
example to get the metadata

621
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:39,059
uh so you get all the information here

622
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,720
and we deployed it directly in AWS with

623
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,659
some Lambda function sqsq and so on and

624
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,880
as getting all the samples directly in

625
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,520
back in the S3 buckets

626
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,100
some statistics about the running

627
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,640
infrastructure so so far we scanned uh

628
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,260
five no 51 K by kgs and it tooks around

629
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,820
12 seconds to scan

630
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,600
so some statistics so as you can see we

631
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,940
have on a daily basis some mad issues

632
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,140
packages uh on uh yeah by scanning like

633
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,340
a three key package per day

634
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,279
finally we have also opened the data set

635
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,500
so you can directly have access to it if

636
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,260
you want so far we have around 1000

637
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,200
packages you can get it because they are

638
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,200
most of the time uh deleted directly

639
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,000
from the payback

640
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,159
and finally it's open so if you want to

641
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,399
contribute feel free to contact us

642
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,520
and that's it and the full the

643
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,900
documentation here

644
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:53,299
[Applause]

645
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,799
foreign

646
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,240
thanks hi everyone so I'm here to talk

647
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,620
about the breadcrumbs that can be found

648
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:35,220
in ransomware negotiations I'm basically

649
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,740
uh arranged on my negotiations collector

650
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,100
I've had copies of more than 150

651
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,100
negotiations involving groups like rival

652
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,559
Dockside Ave norenzi avos Hive black

653
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,200
matter black bastard it's definitely a

654
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,700
privileged point of view as negotiations

655
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,980
are often dealt with away from the RR

656
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,100
team it gets it helps getting access to

657
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,320
decryptos payment addresses and some

658
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,299
more insight into the group into the

659
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:02,820
attackers that are involved as an

660
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,460
example I would just mention that well

661
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,520
wait it's gone would just like to to uh

662
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,500
to mention a few decrypters that got

663
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,380
found like that there used to be one for

664
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,159
dark side that led to building a more

665
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:19,740
generic decrypta based on a

666
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,899
vulnerability or a flow that was found

667
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:25,140
in the encryption routine for the Linux

668
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,919
a6i version variant of a dark side

669
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:31,200
um the case was the same for Hive and

670
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,380
there's been many more cases like that

671
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,600
one of the things that we get to know is

672
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,220
basically show me the money and

673
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,140
following the activity it starts with

674
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,720
one actually observed uh Ransom payment

675
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,820
you have one here on the

676
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,039
left uh

677
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,659
and then you start from there and you

678
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:52,200
try to find a consolidation node as you

679
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,779
see there on the right on the top um top

680
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:56,760
right you've got a consolation node this

681
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,700
is a County case uh this node was

682
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,460
actually mentioned uh in the pro Draft

683
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,059
report on Conti last November but it had

684
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:07,980
already been found before

685
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,620
not publicly mentioned but basically

686
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,840
since you have a consolidation note like

687
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,240
that you start looking back looking back

688
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,399
in the past and trying to assess pass

689
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:19,080
activity you can also try to put a

690
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,059
marker on it and wait just to see what

691
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:24,240
comes in and uh each time you kind of

692
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,100
get to better know about the activity

693
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,380
over the ransomware actor

694
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,140
um that's where you follow up on ongoing

695
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,720
activity here on the top right you will

696
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,760
see a Bitcoin address which actually

697
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,840
leads to the ren exchange uh Bitcoin

698
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,100
Reserve

699
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,320
so that's still the county uh they've

700
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,019
been doing that kind of cleanup uh by

701
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:48,179
the end of May last year

702
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:50,700
uh they tell us somehow a thing about

703
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,919
how they work as well here you have an

704
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:55,620
example also of Conti this script this

705
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,299
way of starting the conversation was

706
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:00,299
seen for 17 negotiations including the

707
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:03,679
ones for exaggered for uh the Irish

708
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,779
SE we've seen some variations as well

709
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:09,179
elsewhere uh this one was slightly

710
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,619
different we've seen it for eight

711
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:13,500
negotiations it helps us confirm that

712
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,080
the group was organized in subdivisions

713
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,719
in subgroups that were all on our on

714
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,219
their own and managing negotiations in

715
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:22,020
themselves and quickly very much we

716
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,060
finished um suspect someone here to have

717
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,980
moved from Revel to Conti if you see

718
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,080
someone encrypting a proof back at one

719
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,760
two three one two three please reach out

720
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,379
to me tell me the group I'm curious

721
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,619
thank you

722
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,060
this contact

723
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:56,280
hello everyone I'm Freddie guado I'm a

724
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,859
co-founder and scientist lead of gleams

725
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:01,440
a young French startup that works on

726
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,380
malware or detection and deep analysis I

727
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,540
didn't intentionally plan on doing this

728
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,780
talk but Danielle this morning basically

729
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,820
is pretty

730
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,200
explicitly asked for that when you

731
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,480
mentioned if we knew if logic y log bit

732
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,640
and continue were related by regarding

733
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,040
that code fortunately a few weeks ago

734
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,140
our city teams worked on log bit green

735
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,020
samples the the hashes are here and I

736
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,280
think that you can find them on malware

737
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,740
Bazaar and then we submit it to our

738
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,619
platform and when we look at malware

739
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:35,640
detection with our interviewers we see

740
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,740
that one of them flagged the malware as

741
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,420
Baza loader

742
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,060
we went deeper and used what what we

743
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,859
call the our deep engine it's our

744
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:46,079
internal internal deep learning

745
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,000
technology that does malware detection

746
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,520
and correlation starting to cut the

747
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,619
analysis I won't go into details here

748
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:56,280
but I'm very happy to discuss this uh

749
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,500
with you this evening of course and as

750
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,540
we can see you can hear identify a few

751
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,579
groups log bit country boat and basal

752
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,579
order that have links with our sample so

753
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:07,320
first a look at the log bits we have

754
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,520
some malicious code that have been

755
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,079
identified and you can see at the bottom

756
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,599
what we call the the heat map where we

757
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,220
show where the malicious code are

758
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,099
located within the address space of the

759
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:19,320
binary if we look at Conti you can see

760
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,660
that the similarities are a bit a bit

761
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,420
fainter it's because as was mentioned

762
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,460
this morning logbeats use the leaked

763
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,200
code from Conti but they change it they

764
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,660
updated it they added on their own code

765
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,060
and if we go further we see that there

766
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,400
are linked with trickbot as well which

767
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,780
is logical because trigger and country

768
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,520
are working together and sharing their

769
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,300
code and

770
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,420
which has even less Merit is and it's

771
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,720
because basically bazard also used the

772
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,119
leaked code from Conti so what we can

773
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,380
get from here is some kind of

774
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,720
transitivity between log bit County and

775
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,660
basalo there because both logbeat and

776
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,060
Basel are there used the code lead from

777
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,079
Conti

778
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,839
I wanted to do this this demo yesterday

779
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,099
but I had the chance to uh to discover

780
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:10,200
uh that the signature from calamavi was

781
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,480
updating within that time and now uh

782
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,579
clemavi uh correctly identifies the fire

783
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,680
as a log bit

784
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,320
thank you very much uh feel free to uh

785
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,720
to meet me this evening if you want to

786
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,320
go more into detail uh with the in

787
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,780
especially the algorithm that we use uh

788
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,440
thank you very much

789
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,180
huh

790
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,800
uh

791
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,140
I I can present it in three minutes in

792
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,760
three minutes the algorithm itself but

793
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,760
not in 14 seconds sorry

794
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,020
thank you

795
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,480
okay please please all get closer

796
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,780
okay

797
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,520
um

798
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,760
so I I gathered with the the jury to

799
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,260
decide who who did the best talk

800
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:14,900
um and uh I I just well we decided sorry

801
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,119
[Applause]

802
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,619
thank you

803
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:26,400
so um so Felix who did a a good demo

804
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,320
that worked uh deserves the price

805
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,489
[Applause]

806
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,420
and really thank you to all of you it

807
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,520
was a great listening to those talks I'm

808
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,700
sure everybody was happy to uh all those

809
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,300
exchanges uh free offers for exchange of

810
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,460
information exchange of tools Etc so

811
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,960
it's a really great thank you so much

812
