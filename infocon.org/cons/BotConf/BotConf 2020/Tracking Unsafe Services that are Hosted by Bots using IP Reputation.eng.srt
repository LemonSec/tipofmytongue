1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,520
hello everyone

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,879
my name is assaf nettler and together

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,000
with jordan garzon

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,320
we are presenting this talk titled

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,680
tracking unsaved services that are

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,600
hosted by bots using the pure reputation

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,759
both jordan and myself are data

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,519
scientists and security researchers for

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,439
akamai technologies

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,198
our emails are listed below if you want

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,198
to reach out to us after the conference

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,760
the agenda has two parts the first part

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,360
displayed by me will

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,879
discuss the introduction and the

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,480
overview of the system that we're

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,559
proposing

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,480
then i'll hand over the stage to jordan

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,839
to discuss the analysis of the system

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,839
and the takeaways

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,320
so as an introduction we know that bots

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,399
are machines

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,440
on the internet that are controlled by a

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,000
single entity

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,440
typically called the bother to deliver

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,320
attacks

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,718
on external services so for instance a

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,920
bot

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,119
might conduct an account takeover attack

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,360
in which various known stolen passwords

30
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,400
are used against an external service or

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,040
conversely issue a denial of service

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,080
attacks

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,960
against a set of web servers

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,360
however while we typically think of bots

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,919
as

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,560
delivering attacks against external

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,200
services

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,159
they can also be used to host malicious

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,040
contact

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,360
content and wait for victims to visit

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,040
them

42
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,640
so for instance bots may be hosting

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,759
phishing campaigns for victims to visit

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,200
or drive attacks for victims to visit

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,640
and download a malware

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,920
when browsing the webpage that is hosted

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,920
on the block machine

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,399
so the motivation for the system that

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,119
we're proposing

50
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,799
is to track boston the internet that

51
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,119
carry out

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,840
malicious attacks into external web

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,040
services

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,040
and then protect end users from visiting

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,360
content that is hosted

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,200
on the stream servers hosted by the bots

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,599
to potentially protect

58
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,760
the end users against phishing malware

59
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,399
and other malicious content that may be

60
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,000
hosted

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,000
on the the bob machines

62
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,760
so to do that we first need to go over

63
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,040
the

64
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,879
concept of ip reputation so we start

65
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,319
with the academic platform which is the

66
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,120
largest world cdn being used to host

67
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,599
websites uh related to healthcare

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,120
banking

69
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,200
and finance and e-commerce the websites

70
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,959
that are hosted on the akamai platform

71
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,200
are typically subjects to

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,959
various attacks by bots such as

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,280
distributed denial of service

74
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,280
account takeover and sql injection

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,760
our systems at akamai are tracking

76
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,720
ips that communicate with websites on

77
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,079
the cdn

78
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,440
and whenever these devices are behaving

79
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,640
in a malicious manner

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,040
they get a poor ap reputation score

81
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,159
so there's a single database in which

82
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,079
each of the device

83
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,879
that interacts with the websites is

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,800
getting a score based on its behavior

85
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,599
and the akamai cdn platform is

86
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,440
interacting with more than 1.3 billion

87
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,839
devices per day

88
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,319
so for each one of those devices we

89
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,120
record a score to know

90
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,079
which ones are potentially bots hosted

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,840
carrying out

92
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,840
attacks against websites hosted on cdn

93
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,559
so using the ip reputation we are able

94
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,879
to identify

95
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,200
bots that are engaging in delivering

96
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,640
external attacks right outbound attacks

97
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,200
but now we're looking at the other

98
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,040
direction once we have the idea of

99
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,319
who these bots are and we know there are

100
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,480
key addresses

101
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,599
how can we protect users against

102
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,640
visiting content

103
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,879
hosted on these spots so for that we're

104
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,279
looking at the dns protocol

105
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,239
so dns protocol is the core component of

106
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,319
the internet

107
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,680
typically used to translate human

108
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,000
memorable domain names

109
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,519
into internet relatable ip addresses so

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,239
for instance the dns

111
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,000
protocol will assist in translating the

112
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,199
domain name akamai.com

113
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,600
to an ip to an ap address

114
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,280
and akamai processes on a daily basis

115
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,400
more than 2.2 trillion dns requests

116
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,159
so whenever user a user makes a dns

117
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,479
request to translate a specific

118
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,639
domain name if we know that the domain

119
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,280
name is resolved to an ip

120
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,919
that was previously associated with a

121
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,719
specific

122
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,400
bot carrying attacks against websites on

123
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,199
the akamai cdn

124
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,320
then rather than serving the dns request

125
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,440
we can block that

126
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,520
thus saving and protecting the user

127
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,320
from visiting content hosted on a

128
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,320
malicious machine

129
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,759
so now we combine the two points

130
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,560
together we combine the dns and the ap

131
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,120
reputation

132
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,520
so so as a first step we collect ap

133
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,960
reputation based on bots that attack

134
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,440
websites hosted on the akamai cdn

135
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,359
and then on the dns we're looking for

136
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,320
machines

137
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:21,199
that are being resolved to to these ips

138
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,000
so these are practically the two steps

139
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,440
we're first focusing on identifying ip

140
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,600
addresses of bots

141
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,600
and then as a second step we're looking

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,880
for domain names on the internet

143
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,680
that exclusively resolve to an

144
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,840
ap which we know is associated for a bot

145
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,840
over a sufficiently long period of time

146
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,479
so at this point i will hand over the

147
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,840
stage to jordan for the analysis and the

148
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,840
takeaways of the system

149
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,160
hello everyone thank you assad for

150
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,880
presenting the first part as you

151
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,199
understood

152
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,199
we're gonna use two types of data the

153
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,400
data of the rp reputation

154
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,840
plus the data of our oppressive dns

155
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,400
the enterprise dns traffic so let's

156
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,638
dive more into the technical details of

157
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,719
the system

158
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,440
first question that we're going to ask

159
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,280
is what malicious content is typically

160
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,240
acid on both

161
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,119
and the second one is what number threat

162
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,240
we are discovering with this technique

163
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,800
let's start with the data so on one end

164
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,919
we have the data from ip reputation from

165
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,800
the cdn

166
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,919
from the attackers of the cdn there we

167
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,039
extracted

168
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:38,000
700 000 ip addresses

169
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,520
involved in inbound attack when i say

170
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,520
inbound attack

171
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,560
it's basically the attacks coming from

172
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,359
the hackers

173
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,240
to the victim for example a screen

174
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,520
injection

175
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:53,440
i can't take over ddos etc

176
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,440
those are inbound attacks

177
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,039
in this data set we have three parts the

178
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,639
biggest part

179
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,960
is accounting cover data

180
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,000
the second one is the classic web

181
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,599
attacks

182
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,360
screen injection rfi lfi etc and the

183
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,120
last part the tiny part

184
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,120
is ddos ips

185
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,039
about the second data set we have we

186
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,639
sampled

187
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:24,240
two weeks of enterprise dns traffic with

188
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:27,520
11 billion dns queries a day

189
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:32,479
from those queries we extract the domain

190
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:34,799
we ended up with 11.1 million domain

191
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,919
we worked second level domain because we

192
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,680
did this analysis

193
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,680
with only primary domain

194
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,039
most of them are resolved to a single ip

195
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,599
address

196
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,599
nowadays with the shared hosting

197
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,639
platforms

198
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:55,039
most of the wave site shared their ip

199
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,080
meaning that the platform that hosts

200
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,280
those websites

201
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,280
use one ip to host several websites

202
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,000
only 15 percent is written as a unique

203
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,719
ip

204
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,120
why do we need a unique ip because if we

205
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,759
want

206
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,960
to make to make a join between ip

207
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,440
reputation

208
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,198
and the ip of the domain we need to be

209
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,639
sure hundred percent

210
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:24,800
that we link the good domain to the ip

211
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:29,360
otherwise we can create first positive

212
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:32,080
and 10 percent is 0.1 percent sorry

213
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,039
is identified as outbound attack what is

214
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,839
oddball attack

215
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,120
is basically the opposite of inbound

216
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,839
meaning that this time

217
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,440
the victim is reaching to the hackers

218
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,560
for example in the case of phishing

219
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,519
website

220
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:50,319
the users browse the phishing website

221
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,320
so again we have three parts so from the

222
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,120
from those 10k domains we have three

223
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,640
parts

224
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,920
we are phishing campaigns

225
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:05,360
malware's hosting websites

226
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,360
and websites used for cnc communication

227
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,440
if we summarize we have the world of ip

228
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,399
addresses

229
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:17,440
with 3.7 billion ip addresses ipv4

230
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,240
we have on one end the data set of ip

231
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,040
reputation with more than 7

232
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,360
hundred thousand ip addresses involved

233
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,040
in

234
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,600
attacks the second data set is composed

235
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,399
of

236
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,440
dns traffic and there we extract only

237
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,480
malicious domain

238
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,600
so 10k domain

239
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,080
as well as 10kp because we those domains

240
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,800
have a unique ip

241
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,760
and if we make the cross we find that

242
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,120
only 90

243
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,920
we find only 95 ip addresses

244
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,959
it looks small but if we take a look

245
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,240
closer

246
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:57,119
we see that it's basically one percent

247
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,480
one percent of all malicious contents

248
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,040
meaning outbound attacks

249
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,399
phishing website malware hosting website

250
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,240
etc

251
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:09,120
are also involved in inbound attack

252
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,079
so when you draw the phishing website

253
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,640
you have a chance

254
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:15,839
of 100 to be on the same place of a

255
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,839
screen injection for example

256
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:23,200
just a small remark we used only labor

257
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,600
data of course to not make mistakes

258
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,160
so we get one percent but in the wild we

259
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,600
expect higher correlation

260
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,880
we can maybe reach two three percent

261
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,880
of of the intersection

262
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,319
now let's take a look of the location of

263
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,760
those ap

264
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,640
most of them are located in the asia

265
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,200
china hong kong vietnam singapore of

266
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,040
course in u.s because it's a big country

267
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,240
but we've been running this project over

268
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,839
a few months already

269
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,839
and most of the iep are there

270
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,279
and you'll see why at the conclusion

271
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,279
it's important to notice that

272
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,839
now if we want to cross

273
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,560
the type of the inbound with the type of

274
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,560
the envelope

275
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,399
we see that the highest correlation

276
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,599
happened between

277
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,720
phishing and web attack

278
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,000
you have no chance to go to blow the

279
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,880
fishing website

280
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,079
and be on the same place let's say of

281
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,519
ddos

282
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,519
or same for malware and ddos but you

283
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,200
have a high chance to be of the same

284
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,519
play in the same place of

285
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,120
screen injection rfi xss etc

286
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,800
even though web attack we don't have a

287
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,839
big data of attack

288
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,839
still the is correlation happened there

289
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,720
now about our detection is it a

290
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,240
known issue among cyber community so

291
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,800
again we've been running this project

292
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,480
for a few months

293
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:04,560
and every day we detect

294
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,560
500 domain that we block

295
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:13,359
among those domain 80 is not

296
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:15,600
detected by any engine on varys total

297
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,399
i just want to remind you that those

298
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,200
domains

299
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,720
are linked to malicious activity so they

300
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,800
are for sure

301
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:27,839
suspicious even malicious we should not

302
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:31,599
browse there and still

303
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:34,399
only 20 percent are detected

304
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,200
also we are providing our customers with

305
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,600
8k

306
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,240
suspicious domain so they can block them

307
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,240
if they want

308
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:48,320
now let's take a look at two examples

309
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,519
the first one is a group of website

310
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:55,200
that we detected on october issuing

311
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:58,639
icon takeover against a very popular

312
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,320
french streaming platform let's take a

313
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,639
look at those website

314
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:07,440
we picked only five of them but there is

315
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:10,480
a big list i'll give you

316
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,200
a few seconds to look at it

317
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,720
you see it's they are based on the same

318
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,120
templates

319
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,680
you see the ips this is the eyepiece

320
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,639
provided by their

321
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,560
domain this is the domain we found with

322
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,000
our dns data

323
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,479
and this is why we blocked them now

324
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,720
also some of them are detected by

325
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,959
varistota

326
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,920
they are all located on the same

327
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:42,079
autonomous system

328
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,680
they target all the same targets

329
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,479
and the question that i want to ask you

330
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,319
now do you want to put your email there

331
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,240
submit your application now do you want

332
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,199
to put it

333
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,600
we don't recommend it why because those

334
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,319
are website under attacker consoles

335
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,079
that do not contain margaritas they do

336
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,000
not contain phishing pages

337
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,239
but still they are under article

338
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,440
controls

339
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,360
let's see a second one it's basically a

340
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,000
classic malicious website

341
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,720
so we've seen the end of october attacks

342
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,360
coming from the ip

343
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:21,760
51.83 etc issuing speed injection

344
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:24,800
wordpress scanning vulnerability on

345
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,800
on several customers

346
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,680
our algorithm resulted to

347
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:35,920
the domain research research3d.com

348
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,880
it was also a newly registered domain

349
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,880
and this is how it looks

350
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,000
on vt it's pretty easy to see that this

351
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,839
is malicious

352
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,600
we are with nine detections on these

353
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,079
domains and

354
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,519
it's a distributor of emotes malwares

355
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,000
with document files

356
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,000
so this is basically what happened only

357
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,360
on twenty percent of the data

358
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
classic malicious website

359
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,639
so about the conclusion more than one

360
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,440
percent

361
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,480
of malicious website are involved in web

362
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,000
attack

363
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:14,880
it doesn't happen a lot but the majority

364
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,920
are hosted on asia and also in u.s

365
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,880
the highest correlation happened between

366
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,399
fishing malwares and web attack meaning

367
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,360
when you go to fishing

368
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,560
or malwa website you have a high chance

369
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,920
to be on the same place

370
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:33,119
of web attack speed injection xss lfi

371
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,479
but not ddos for example we are

372
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,519
protecting our users

373
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:41,519
with 500 domain a day plus

374
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:44,959
8k suspicious domain

375
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:48,399
i underline again that 80

376
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:51,040
of those domain the 500 are not detected

377
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,959
by any engine on vt

378
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,839
even though they are definitely linked

379
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,839
to malicious activity

380
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:02,399
but the future work we want to convert

381
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,680
those suspicious domain to 8k to

382
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,560
non-domain

383
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,439
with metadata geolocation autonomous

384
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,279
system

385
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,560
website templates those are features

386
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,560
maybe for a machine learning model

387
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,279
what is possible we can maybe enrich the

388
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,758
ip reputation with the ipo domain

389
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,639
in our case we use ip reputation to

390
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,160
enrich

391
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,480
our intelligence of domain

392
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,719
also we are seeking about releasing a

393
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,839
full detailed view of the algorithm

394
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,880
so it can benefit the community

395
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,839
thank you very much q a i hope you

396
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,839
enjoyed
