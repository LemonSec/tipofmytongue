00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,720
hello

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:09,280
and uh welcome to my paper um thank you

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,920
very much for taking the time to

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,719
hear me talk about it uh and i'd love to

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,440
hear any

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,160
questions either in a session afterwards

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,759
or my contact details are on the screen

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,920
if you have any questions or queries at

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,119
any stage please

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,720
reach out i do very much enjoy talking

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,640
about

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:34,480
these topics the paper itself

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,280
is an overview of a proposed model

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,398
that can help support the takedown of

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,120
botnets

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,559
the paper is written using iot botnets

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,959
as an example

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,800
as such it's optimized for iot but the

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,320
principles themselves will work with

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,760
any form of botnet um and

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,239
just really before we get into it some

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,839
housekeeping the conference paper itself

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,879
will be available on the botnet

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,399
on the conf uh website it's also

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,039
available on my own website

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,239
the kind of link is on the screen and

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,119
the

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,400
detailed model which this paper is based

29
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,439
on

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,320
is from an earlier paper of mine and the

31
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,080
link to that

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,000
is also on the screen as well before we

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,759
get into the details of the proposed

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,680
model i think it's worthwhile going

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,840
through some of the challenges

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,560
that are present when trying to take

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,680
down botnets from a legal perspective

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,640
the first is a bit of a legal theory one

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,360
and it's basically that a compromised

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,560
device an iot device

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,960
it's both or it's its owner or operator

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,920
is both a victim because a botnet

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,199
operator has come in

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,200
and added malware to that but

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,560
it can also be viewed as a perpetrator

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,759
because this device

47
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,360
is in itself causing damage and

48
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,680
this creates a bit of a problem in the

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,360
law um the kind of

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,040
kind of actually kind of legal

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,520
approaches work really well

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,200
when it's very clearly defined roles

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,240
when there's a blurring or an

54
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,600
overlap we get a sub-optimal outcome and

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,519
the consequence of this in terms of

56
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,200
botnets has been we really ignore the

57
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,720
nodes and the devices and we focus on

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,040
the botnet in the hole

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,359
this is reinforced by the scale problem

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,200
where the individual damage caused by a

61
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,200
given device is effectively in

62
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,679
infant infertile and therefore again we

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,079
focus

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,879
on the botnet as a single entity on the

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,599
whole and we

66
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,079
target the botnet operator this leads to

67
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,640
some problems which we go into in

68
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,200
more detail in which like my model

69
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,399
doesn't

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,440
actually take this approach the biggest

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,480
problem though

72
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,040
um when it comes to a law enforcement

73
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,238
uh approach or legal approach to to

74
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,400
botnet take stands

75
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,000
is what i call persistence and

76
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,879
persistence relates to the fact

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,599
that a botnet operator has found a way

78
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,840
to

79
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,760
plant malware for a particular device or

80
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,040
a particular class of device

81
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,040
and if that operator is subsequently

82
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,799
prosecuted arrested his

83
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,879
servers taken down that that malware

84
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,080
still exists on those devices which have

85
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,079
been compromised

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,319
and that method of approach that the

87
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,400
botnet operator used

88
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,879
is often still in existence which means

89
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,560
we go to this expensive exercise

90
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,560
of prosecuting uh individuals of taking

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,959
down command and control

92
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,440
um infrastructure and servers and we

93
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,720
leave the actual threat

94
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,200
and the exploit and this

95
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,319
is a problem which exists at all scales

96
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,200
of botnet takes down

97
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,159
of botnet takes take downs which i'll be

98
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,079
going through

99
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,239
and this is really what my model was

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,680
built around to fix is how do we solve

101
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,680
the problem of

102
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,799
persistence when looking at takedowns

103
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,040
there's a bit of a hierarchy

104
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,879
i'll try and fly through this at the

105
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,560
very top we've public international law

106
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,518
this is how states interact with each

107
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,159
with each other

108
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,599
and there is a a well understood the

109
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,959
core food channel case goes back to the

110
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,000
1940s

111
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,080
case of if a nation-state

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,599
knows that either entities under its

113
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,200
control or entities

114
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,200
under that it's aware of um are

115
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,478
engaging in acts which are contrary to

116
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,959
the rights of other states

117
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,560
they have an obligation to stop this

118
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,519
theoretically this would solve the

119
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,680
problem of

120
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,720
botnets in one country or a botnet

121
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,080
operator in

122
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,000
one country attacking um

123
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,440
victims in other countries but in

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,400
reality it doesn't

125
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,400
we find it very difficult to uh uh

126
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,198
establish attack attribution

127
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,080
and even when we know for certain that a

128
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,600
particular

129
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,080
and um body of a nation-state

130
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,880
is engaged in this activity how do we

131
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,479
enforce it

132
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,040
um that's the problem so at the at the

133
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,080
public international law level um the

134
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,040
theory is there

135
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,800
the practice really isn't we go then a

136
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,080
bit lower to the criminal law

137
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,479
um and this upfront has worked well

138
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,440
there have been very

139
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,159
well noted examples of law enforcement

140
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,680
agencies

141
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,440
taking down botnets and arresting botnet

142
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,759
perpetrators and taking down

143
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,440
the infrastructure behind it there is

144
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,560
the problem of persistence which we've

145
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,960
already mentioned

146
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,080
but let's take for example a botnet

147
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,280
which i think the

148
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,280
kind lamarrie

149
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,080
in a few slides time is a good example

150
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,759
the perpetrator was in spain the spanish

151
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,599
authorities were able to

152
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,919
uh target him arrest him they're able to

153
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,280
work with spanish isps to take it down

154
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,479
and then they were also able to work

155
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,320
with the fbi and

156
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,599
work with other eastern european states

157
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,280
but they they

158
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,639
they actually were really operating in

159
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,559
their own area

160
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,000
and as such there were there there

161
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,000
weren't barriers where

162
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,680
they had to seek extradition they had to

163
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,440
get local law

164
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,240
enforcement support and they had to get

165
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,440
the backing really of the state

166
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,639
it would not be possible today to

167
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,080
uh go after a botnet operator for

168
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,080
example in russia

169
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,318
who has the backing of the russian state

170
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,599
they simply will not turn him over

171
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,240
or engage in the investigation which is

172
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,360
a problem

173
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,520
in certain regions less of a problem

174
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,759
where it's essentially allies working

175
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,719
together

176
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,639
a level to the side of this is really

177
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,800
working groups and here we see

178
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,880
private and state entities we see

179
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,160
software manufacturers isps law

180
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,960
enforcement agencies

181
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,560
working together two examples that i

182
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,799
mentioned one is conficker

183
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,759
the conflict of working group um you

184
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,600
know

185
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,120
kind of kind of really are the textbook

186
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,720
case of how to do this

187
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,400
the problem being is it's complicated

188
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,400
it's expensive it

189
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,479
requires a lot of coordination and

190
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,120
therefore will only really be

191
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,880
applicable when the threat or scope of

192
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,280
damage is very very large

193
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,719
for smaller botnets it's just not going

194
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,599
to be possible to marshal

195
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,000
these resources there are some legal

196
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,520
hurdles

197
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,360
as well in terms of are the

198
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,080
cybersecurity researchers able to

199
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,880
actually

200
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,840
investigate and attack the actual botnet

201
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,199
themselves to get

202
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,080
information on it um but really it comes

203
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,240
down to

204
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,919
this works for large-scale threats and

205
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,880
again when the countries are working

206
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,960
with each other

207
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,280
and less so if if if like they aren't

208
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,880
private entities do this microsoft is in

209
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,638
the news very recently with the trick

210
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,680
block botnet they've done it in past

211
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,240
with neckers

212
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,919
and this is really where they or an

213
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,400
entity working say that microsoft

214
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,680
working with isps or working with some

215
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,239
other researchers

216
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,720
uh put together evidence of a botnet

217
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,759
they

218
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,039
are able to then mount a kind of legal

219
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,199
approach where

220
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,719
usually targeting the botnet command and

221
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,000
control infrastructure it needs to be

222
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,680
taken down

223
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,240
problem again is it's expensive it's

224
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,199
complicated it's time consuming

225
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,400
it's also not very effective because if

226
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,199
we look at trick bot

227
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,919
um there's still a large number of isps

228
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,360
who just

229
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,120
are going to ignore the uh kind of legal

230
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,759
writ from the district court in the

231
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,879
states

232
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,319
it will only work in areas where

233
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,720
the applicability of the court is

234
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,840
respected and won't really work outside

235
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,000
of that scope

236
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,119
and then at the uh at a level beneath

237
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,680
that we have cyber

238
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,120
vigilantes these are private individuals

239
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,319
they can work alone they can work in

240
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,759
conjunction with with

241
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:32,320
uh with with um with other

242
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,440
uh individuals and have two examples one

243
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,800
negative one positive

244
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,479
uh bricker bot um this was

245
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:43,838
a la vigilante who created malware

246
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,640
which identified iot devices which were

247
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,760
vulnerable to

248
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,800
mirai and brick them to stop them

249
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,480
forming part of

250
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,279
the the botnet the problem here is this

251
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,720
is essentially the same act as what the

252
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,080
cyber criminals who are running mirai

253
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,959
were doing themselves i mean this is a

254
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,200
crime

255
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,000
um and then on the wannacry with marcus

256
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,120
hutchins

257
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,040
he was able to stop the spread of uh

258
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,240
wannacry through the registration of the

259
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,160
domain the problem here

260
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,760
in marcus's example it was effective it

261
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,560
stopped the spread but

262
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,600
overall is it that effective is it

263
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,599
preventing

264
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,440
further botnets from spreading is it

265
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,000
solving the problem of kind of

266
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,279
of persistence are the actions

267
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,080
themselves actually

268
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,480
legal uh and in many cases they aren't

269
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,040
and

270
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,000
generally they're not uh raising the

271
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,319
standard that

272
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,440
they they aren't protecting other

273
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,560
devices

274
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,680
and therefore they're not really solving

275
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,439
the problem as a whole

276
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,040
they might stop a particular strain of

277
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,680
malware or stop

278
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,240
the spread of a particular botnet for a

279
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,399
short

280
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:54,880
time but they're not closing the door

281
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:57,519
um this should be

282
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,080
it should be clear now that overall

283
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,880
there is no one-size-fits-all

284
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,560
solution there's a lot of complicated

285
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,560
problems which

286
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,160
aren't that easy to solve which is why

287
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,199
we are where we are

288
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,959
um and really the model

289
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,839
i'm proposing um is it it's focused on

290
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,119
the problem of

291
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,519
of kind of

292
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,720
her assistance and it recognizes the

293
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,200
fact that

294
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,360
most jurisdictions who are causing the

295
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,480
problems aren't going to play well

296
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,079
uh with law enforcement agencies in in

297
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,800
um in other regions

298
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,760
and it accepts this and it doesn't

299
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,920
require

300
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,200
that these problems be solved which a

301
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,120
normal uh

302
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,440
law enforcement approach actually does

303
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,320
the positives i guess from the hierarchy

304
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,480
is that

305
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,440
there is it is clear that there is an

306
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,880
excellent

307
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,079
uh link between researchers and

308
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,240
individuals and companies

309
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,319
there is a large amount of information

310
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,240
being exchanged there's a lot of back

311
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,720
and forth talking on a formal

312
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,360
um an informal basis and this is

313
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,079
something which

314
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,560
which like which needs to form part of

315
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,359
the

316
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,719
solution and is built into the approach

317
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,920
which will be going through

318
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,160
um on the next slide

319
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,160
the first point really to get across is

320
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,839
this is not a criminal approach we're

321
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,920
not looking to arrest someone we won't

322
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,519
be sending the fbi into kick down some

323
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,640
doors

324
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,880
to shut down a botnet in fact we won't

325
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,839
even be going after the servers

326
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,920
that are running these botnets we've

327
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,680
already

328
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,959
gone through the fact that there are

329
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,920
approaches which

330
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,199
which target these and they should still

331
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,800
continue to happen

332
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,519
and that and those law enforcement

333
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,599
approaches

334
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,440
should still keep going but this

335
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,079
approach works on a different basis it's

336
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,639
civil

337
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,599
uh based so there's no criminal

338
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,000
requirement requirements brought by

339
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,480
private

340
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,399
actors and as a result of this there is

341
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,480
no

342
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,240
centralized uh entity needed to run the

343
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,320
model we don't need a working group we

344
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,880
don't need someone to take point on this

345
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,600
it's simply going to happen where damage

346
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,360
and

347
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,120
crime occurs it's efficient as well and

348
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,560
like what i mean by this is it's built

349
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,440
around the fact that there is

350
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,880
coordination

351
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,480
between actors and it's also

352
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,560
taking a look at the fact that a botnet

353
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,160
is not a singular entity it is many many

354
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,920
nodes and it's built around

355
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,279
that fact that it is a network and we

356
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,360
target there for the

357
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,560
kind of network itself from a legal

358
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,279
perspective

359
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,560
it's well understood this is not a novel

360
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,519
legal approach this is

361
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,599
this this type of approach has been in

362
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,040
use for over 100 years it's well

363
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,440
understood there is

364
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,800
volumes and volumes of case law and

365
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,480
there's volumes and volumes of

366
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,839
evidence that this actually works and

367
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,920
does alter behavior

368
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,480
and finally as i said earlier the aim

369
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,360
here is to target the actual underlying

370
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,760
malware which is

371
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,160
causing the spread of the botnet to

372
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,639
create a situation where if

373
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,279
a botnet operator is able to get a

374
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,519
device

375
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,279
into their network they can't rely on

376
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,200
that for a long period of time and if

377
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,760
the botnet operator is taken down in a

378
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,720
law

379
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,360
enforcement operation the devices

380
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,639
themselves

381
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,079
should be cleaned we change the focus in

382
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,519
how we look at botnets

383
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,439
as i said earlier um the law enforcement

384
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,720
approach has been it's a singular entity

385
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,200
that's managed by

386
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,240
a botnet controller instead we looked at

387
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,480
the botnet b

388
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,760
is simply the sum of the individual

389
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,399
devices m

390
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,920
and i put in a scale factor here row

391
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,279
which is how efficient

392
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,599
and effective each individual

393
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,480
node is at carrying out the games of the

394
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,839
botnet

395
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,800
if it's a ddos type botnet i expect row

396
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,399
to be very high

397
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,319
if it's more specialist it's going to

398
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,720
need more specialized nodes and if it's

399
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,399
not

400
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,560
if it's not able to get them but instead

401
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,880
gets other devices row will be low

402
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,560
which lowers the efficacy of the botnet

403
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,560
which is important later on

404
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,638
however this assumes that a botnet is

405
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,000
simply a random collection

406
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:09,440
of um of compromised

407
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,720
uh devices and that simply isn't true

408
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,240
when a botnet operator is able to crack

409
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,399
or or find a way into a particular

410
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,000
type of device you're going to see more

411
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,600
of those and groupings

412
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,440
of these compromised nodes in the botnet

413
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,040
and therefore we think of botnets

414
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,160
instead of

415
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,800
groups which here is there's t groups in

416
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,760
the botnet and it's simply the sum of

417
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,439
those groups

418
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,760
each of which has their own nodes and

419
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,120
first for simplicity

420
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:44,240
i assume a standardized row per um

421
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,760
group uh just to make the model work uh

422
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,079
on a more simpler basis

423
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,560
but you can see now we've gone from the

424
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,519
botnet being a singular entity to a

425
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,638
group of

426
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:57,199
or to a range of individual

427
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,240
devices and we recognize that within

428
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,399
these range

429
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,760
you've got clumps and large numbers of

430
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,199
similar devices

431
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:08,079
if we are able to fix

432
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,479
one group through a single action of say

433
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:14,638
the actual building of a patch

434
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,800
it knocks all of those devices in theory

435
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,800
out of the botnet and therefore it puts

436
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,839
a pressure on the botnet operator to

437
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,719
keep finding

438
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,199
new devices to uh to actually let go

439
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,279
into it

440
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,880
which won't stay there for long and once

441
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,480
we crack the botnet

442
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,600
and take down the operator if if we then

443
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,120
target those

444
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:38,839
t groups um that's

445
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,600
how we can solve the problem of

446
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,440
persistence um i should have probably

447
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,680
skipped a slide here but this is

448
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,000
this is basically what i was saying um

449
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,239
and it's really

450
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,440
built around we need to alter the

451
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,480
environment so an

452
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,440
iot device and the manufacturers of an

453
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,320
iot device

454
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,079
when a vulnerability becomes clear and

455
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,959
becomes known

456
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,319
a patches is like released is pushed out

457
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,599
and it prevents

458
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,000
either a person who's taken over the

459
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,680
botnet

460
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,199
in the event that it's been taken down

461
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,758
from from resurrecting it again

462
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,680
or it'll also prevent other devices

463
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,880
which have yet to be compromised

464
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,920
from falling victim to it

465
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,839
a key point before we go into the

466
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,519
model in detail is i mentioned earlier

467
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,519
in the law enforcement approach we

468
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,279
haven't if we there's an

469
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,600
effectiveness problem if certain

470
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,880
jurisdictions choose not to engage in

471
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,839
the process

472
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,320
this is not a problem in this model as

473
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,600
long as

474
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,000
one or two large markets such as a north

475
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,279
american market or the european market

476
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,199
um if they buy into this approach

477
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:55,360
the manufacturers of iot

478
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,000
devices who are selling in that region

479
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,920
are going to need to

480
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,160
follow the actual principles here

481
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,439
they're not going to hold these patches

482
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,799
back from other markets

483
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,199
they're not going to create a a series

484
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,240
of

485
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,319
of uh channels and so so that some of

486
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,839
the devices are updated and some aren't

487
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,559
they're just going to have as simple and

488
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,799
as most

489
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:24,559
economic approach to to

490
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:28,160
basically managing this and therefore

491
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:31,280
a user in china or a user in africa or

492
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,840
in russia whose government

493
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,360
may not be applying this approach will

494
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,720
still benefit from it because these

495
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,240
updates should start to be coming

496
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,679
downstream

497
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,320
finally this is not a novel legal

498
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,679
approach

499
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,840
this is well established and as i said

500
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,280
there is there are volumes and volumes

501
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,080
of evidence that's outlined

502
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,039
in the paper that this as an approach

503
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,280
works

504
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,120
um it does alter behavior and it does

505
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,120
solve the problem

506
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,639
the current problem being it's never

507
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,479
really been applied to software

508
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,400
um there's always it's software has

509
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,559
always been given a pass it's only

510
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,480
ever really applied to physical goods or

511
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,480
dumb goods

512
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,760
the principle that we're basing this on

513
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,840
is uh tort

514
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,840
and specifically the tort of

515
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,440
negligence which is a private action

516
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,360
taken by

517
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,039
someone who suffered harm and they're

518
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,439
seeking to right that harm

519
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,559
this goes back to the late 1800s it's

520
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,600
principles based

521
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,720
there's there's basically a framework in

522
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,080
which to

523
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,360
assess that the harm caused and the

524
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,039
actions are in actions

525
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,719
by the various parties and it's

526
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,520
victim-led and this

527
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,400
so where damage occurs this can spring

528
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,000
up it doesn't require

529
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,160
a police investigation it doesn't

530
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,240
require a working group form it's just

531
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,960
if harm is is actually suffered there's

532
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,440
a relatively straightforward

533
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,160
way of going about and getting it fixed

534
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,400
and that's

535
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,240
really the basis of the approach

536
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,440
principles of like negligence themselves

537
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,080
are quite straightforward

538
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,440
you have a party who has a duty of care

539
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,360
to another party

540
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,200
um this is this is essentially they have

541
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,479
some responsibility

542
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,840
they breach this duty and then crucially

543
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,840
damage arises if i own a smart device

544
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,199
which has a vulnerability and other

545
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,959
people have

546
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,960
suffered harm i cannot take an action

547
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,320
until i myself have suffered harm or

548
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,840
someone else has suffered harm at the

549
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,960
hands of my device

550
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,720
um so it's it it is damage based

551
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,799
and there's finally a point there called

552
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,200
legal causation which is just because

553
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,480
the uh causation has happened as a

554
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,160
matter of fact

555
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,080
uh it doesn't necessarily follow that it

556
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,400
happens as a matter of law

557
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,000
again there's a good body of case law in

558
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,640
this to actually work out what is what

559
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
isn't

560
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,640
um so it doesn't open the floodgates so

561
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,160
to speak

562
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,080
um it it it's it's a case where there

563
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,120
are safeguards where you

564
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,960
built into this process how this would

565
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,918
look like in detail

566
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,039
firstly we assume there's an iot device

567
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,159
a vulnerability is

568
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,960
found this vulnerability is exploitable

569
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,840
and then at some stage this is exploited

570
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,000
so

571
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,600
so that someone hacks that device and

572
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,280
causes damage

573
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,639
um during this time the the the

574
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,200
producer of the device doesn't

575
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,880
uh build a patch or fails to send out

576
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,039
the patch or make the patch

577
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,600
available and that's really the key of

578
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,120
this they failed to act

579
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,799
or fail to act within a reasonable

580
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,000
amount of time which

581
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,840
is roughly 90 days in the

582
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,080
paper i've seen arguments for 30. i've

583
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,000
seen arguments for 180 and longer

584
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,760
and 90 seemed a reasonable compromise

585
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,679
you can see then that this is not

586
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,440
applicable to a zero day exploit if the

587
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,240
company was not aware that there was a

588
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,919
threat

589
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,799
um then they aren't on the hook and

590
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,039
can't be sued if a threat is made

591
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,039
or if a threat is found and then in the

592
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,320
very short space of time there's a large

593
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,520
number of victims

594
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,280
and there's not enough time for the

595
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,360
company to have built a patch and push

596
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,280
it out and

597
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,199
tested it then again they are off the

598
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,720
hook this is really only when the

599
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,760
company is aware of it or should have

600
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,720
been aware of it

601
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,520
and fails to act and then that damage

602
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,760
arises

603
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,559
and this is expected to be class action

604
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,760
based

605
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:27,440
um so that when there is a

606
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:30,480
a um an exploit taking place

607
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,200
the victims will be

608
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,360
amassed in a number of cases rather than

609
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,120
each individual person taking a single

610
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,000
case

611
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,559
the outcome of this model is it's to

612
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,080
force

613
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:48,320
the manufacturers of software to

614
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,120
think about the the the the security of

615
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,200
their products

616
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,439
after they have been shipped and sold so

617
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,400
once a threat becomes found

618
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,480
uh then they should be patching it this

619
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,000
will lead to design changes so

620
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,320
um i remember in the writing of this

621
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,120
paper i had a conversation with someone

622
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,840
involved in the manufacturer of some

623
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,039
smart

624
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,918
devices and they say they write

625
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,760
the operating system as a fixed block on

626
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,400
to the chip it's not updatable but it

627
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,720
hasn't

628
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:21,840
it it is in it is um accessible

629
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,360
um parts of it uh so so parts of their

630
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,520
own applications they actually can

631
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,639
update but the underlying os can't be

632
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,679
updated and that's that was chosen

633
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,440
because it was cheap

634
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,039
and it was the cheapest way of doing it

635
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,000
and no

636
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,640
approach or no thought of cyber security

637
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,880
was taken

638
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,559
and that is exactly the type of behavior

639
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,320
which has to become

640
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:46,960
a conscious choice by the the uh company

641
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,080
if they think the the actual risk is low

642
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,840
then keep doing

643
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,120
what they're doing and pay the price of

644
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,199
the occasional lawsuit

645
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,120
if the risk is higher the lawsuits will

646
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,000
be

647
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,039
kind of with the actual lawsuits will be

648
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,799
more frequent

649
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,240
and if they're not fixing it as the

650
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,240
lawsuits accrue the courts will come

651
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,200
down harder on them

652
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,480
and that should change the behavior it

653
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,080
should also have a clear

654
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,280
end of life type outcome for an iot

655
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,158
device

656
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,879
it should be very clear that after a

657
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,559
certain amount of time

658
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,159
it's not going to be covered anymore the

659
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,678
risk might shift back to the

660
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,520
consumer or the device may stop having

661
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,679
an active internet connection or you can

662
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,120
pay for more updates down the line

663
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,000
again let the consumer make a choice as

664
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,520
to what they want to do

665
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,200
let the company make a choice as to how

666
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,760
they want to do it and then

667
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,799
based on their choices actions or

668
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,520
inactions

669
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,918
they'll be liable or they won't and

670
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,360
that's

671
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,080
really the approach which we're going

672
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,199
for here there is

673
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,279
a bit of a role for a regulator it's not

674
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,320
required but it may make the model more

675
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,679
efficient

676
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,678
the first is um if you have an isp

677
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,360
and they know that there are a large

678
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,799
number of people who are running

679
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:07,199
uh vulnerable iot

680
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,158
products they should be notified that

681
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,320
they're doing so

682
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,440
the aim here is really when they go to

683
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,320
purchase a

684
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,640
replacement device um they will think

685
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,678
about it or if there are risk averse in

686
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,240
d visual they may change the device

687
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,799
others won't care but it means if their

688
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,080
their

689
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:28,720
lut device is used um to

690
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,399
uh as part of a botnet uh and causes

691
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,360
damage they will be on the hook

692
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,000
individuals and consumers who choose to

693
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,879
ignore

694
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,440
warnings or choose to fail to apply

695
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,679
patches

696
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,640
are also on the hook there's an honest

697
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,760
broker role

698
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,039
this is where if i find a

699
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,400
vulnerability how do i go about

700
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,039
notifying the company what if they

701
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,200
choose to

702
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:55,760
ignore me essentially i can log like my

703
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,919
finding with this regulator so that in

704
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,600
the event it does go to court it's there

705
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,840
and therefore there's a record in

706
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,760
actions the challenge is right now we

707
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,360
couldn't roll this out if i was

708
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,559
if if if a state was to

709
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,199
um roll this out in the morning

710
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,480
it wouldn't work you can't take a case

711
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,080
where the damage is what

712
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,760
what's called pure economic loss it's

713
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,520
only monetary and value so

714
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:24,000
if i if i suffer harm

715
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,360
as uh as a result of a botnet taking

716
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,640
down like my website

717
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,080
i lose trade i lose money i cannot sue

718
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,679
on that basis

719
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,918
the courts on the basis of some uh

720
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,760
some views of software going back really

721
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,960
to the late 80s early 90s

722
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,960
have not really found that causation in

723
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,679
fact when it comes to bad code

724
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,039
is valid causation and law it's

725
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,919
something that needs to be

726
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,039
in my view looked again it's gone into a

727
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,840
lot more detail on

728
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:57,440
the paper the product's liability

729
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,360
framework um it's a valid defense to say

730
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,600
when i ship the product it was fine

731
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,279
and this works perfectly well for a

732
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,279
physical product because

733
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,880
um it doesn't have people actively

734
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:11,039
trying to compromise it

735
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,159
so right now that needs to be looked at

736
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,320
in the eu it

737
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,919
sort of has been there's a couple of new

738
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,678
directives coming out

739
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,440
um but they're really sidestepping this

740
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,919
issue um it is

741
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,720
it's it's there but it hasn't really

742
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,480
changed

743
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,279
and then finally there's exclusionary

744
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,000
clauses every single shrink wrap

745
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,559
piece of software says um we are not

746
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,760
liable

747
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,799
you you take it as as as

748
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,480
you find a buyer beware luckily they've

749
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,440
never actually gone to court

750
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,960
um it's there to scare off actions it's

751
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,320
there to

752
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:50,720
show that if a a consumer takes

753
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,399
a case against a large ieot manufacturer

754
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,159
that they we actually are going to fight

755
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,960
it but they are not valid

756
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,400
right now at law no court has ever

757
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,919
actually heard a case

758
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:05,200
where um where a consumer

759
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,919
has challenged um a

760
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,080
shrink wrap exclusionary clause but it

761
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,000
is something that needs to be addressed

762
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,360
thank you very much i hope you found the

763
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,960
paper interesting if you have any

764
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,600
questions as i said please feel free to

765
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,440
get in touch

766
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,360
or take part in the q a directly

767
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,360
afterwards thank you bye
