1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,919
welcome to my talk about hunting for

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,000
mage card

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,160
today i'll first introduce myself then

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
i'll talk about what mage card is

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,080
and about the different skimmers that

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,879
there are how to track campaigns and the

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,519
results of

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,039
the campaigns that i tracked and then i

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,359
want to talk a bit about the

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,720
economic implications that there are to

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,720
all involved parties

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,080
and i want to talk about the indirect

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,759
collaboration i had with

14
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,639
several people around the world that

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,039
made this research partially possible

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,079
so first of all who am i well my name is

17
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,000
max kirsten

18
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,480
i go by the nickname of libra and on

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,879
twitter i used to handle libra analysis

20
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,078
in january 2019 i graduated laude

21
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,839
for my bachelor

22
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,440
and in the meantime i worked as a mower

23
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,079
analyst for android malware

24
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,760
at a company called threatfabric in my

25
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,559
spare time i wrote blogs for my own

26
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,239
website

27
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,239
most of them are dedicated to reverse

28
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,440
engineering and are added to my binary

29
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,760
analysis course

30
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,519
this is a free course that analyzes

31
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,800
malware step by step

32
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,600
using free and open source tooling

33
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,840
i publish my own tools my github profile

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,520
one of which is android project creator

35
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,080
and i gave a talk at the confidence

36
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,360
conference about this tool

37
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,640
last year i also gave a workshop at

38
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,840
botcom 2019 and this was about how to

39
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,960
statically analyze

40
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,080
android malware currently i work for abn

41
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,039
amro which is a banquet in the

42
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,360
netherlands

43
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,320
and i mean the threat intelligence team

44
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,479
there so

45
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,758
the goal of this team is to focus on

46
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,360
outside threats

47
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,280
and thereby increase the security of the

48
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,159
bank but we also

49
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,320
do research in quite a lot of topics and

50
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,079
we aim to give back to the community as

51
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,880
well as we use things from the community

52
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,880
we want to participate as well so an

53
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,600
example could be this talk

54
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,798
or it could be giving a lecture at a

55
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,798
university or high school

56
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,158
so digging into the actual topic of the

57
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,640
talk itself

58
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,680
what is mage card so mage card is a

59
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,960
collective term

60
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,600
for credit card stealers and i mean

61
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,119
digital ones in this sense so the name

62
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,079
comes from the magento e-commerce

63
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,000
platform

64
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,840
which is a known platform to host your

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,200
own webshop with

66
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,200
and makecode has become more of a

67
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,519
household term at this point because

68
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,119
the infosec community writes about

69
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,959
credit cards theaters

70
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,760
generally as mage cards now

71
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,200
some of the actors that are infecting

72
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,160
websites with these skimmers

73
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,799
target only really old ones or they wait

74
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,879
until a

75
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,519
good opportunity arises like the card

76
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,480
lead that has been discovered by sunsek

77
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,760
where the magento one platform was end

78
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,238
of life and

79
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,000
didn't receive any updates anymore and

80
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,239
then they struck infecting over three

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,959
percent of all magento one websites that

82
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,879
sunset knows off

83
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,599
in other cases it might be just a bit

84
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,440
too late to install a recent update

85
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,518
or having a misconfigured part on your

86
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,040
website somewhere else

87
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,640
so mage card skimmers have different

88
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,840
versions and i put versions in between

89
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,679
quotes because you can also have a

90
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,360
really different skimmer

91
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,120
it's not like it's one family with small

92
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,720
adaptations there can be actually

93
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,400
really different scripts out there as

94
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,400
well so

95
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,720
the group that i'm focusing on in this

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,840
research is mage card group 12 as

97
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,120
identified by risk iq in our original

98
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,120
report

99
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,879
i think it's good to use an analogy to

100
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,319
explain how mage card

101
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,599
skimmers work because it's quite hard

102
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,119
and it was actually one of the problems

103
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,760
i had when creating this talk

104
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,640
it's quite hard to visualize this

105
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,399
without

106
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,200
taking too much time so the easiest way

107
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,080
to explain this is with an analogy

108
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,480
let's say you order a t-shirt online

109
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,760
then you are awaiting a physical item

110
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,760
which you've paid for

111
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,120
so you went to the web shop you selected

112
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,200
the t-shirt you wanted you filled in

113
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,080
your credentials and your

114
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,760
location your first name last name etc

115
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,200
you paid the money the webshop receives

116
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,200
the money and you get the t-shirt

117
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,200
that's the normal transaction now in

118
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,640
case of physically stealing something

119
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,359
the t-shirt would never arrive or it

120
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,839
would be stolen from your front door

121
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,480
however the digital world works

122
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,799
differently

123
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,319
because i can copy these details during

124
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,519
the transaction which is exactly what

125
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,000
the skimmer does

126
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,680
but then your payment still goes through

127
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,560
company receives the money you get the

128
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,680
shirt

129
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,560
nobody is aware that anything went wrong

130
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,720
aside from the

131
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,160
criminal from whose perspective

132
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,440
perspective it went

133
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,800
uh correct in that case now maybe a few

134
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,120
months later

135
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,720
you will see that you have weird

136
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,880
transactions on your credit card so

137
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,000
you're losing money in thousands and

138
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,320
thousands per day

139
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,280
so you contact your credit card holder

140
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,040
and you ask

141
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,960
what's up how is this possible because i

142
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,080
didn't make these transactions

143
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,359
and then you find out you've been

144
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,000
skimmed so it doesn't take anything away

145
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,320
and that is the easiest way to compare

146
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
that with is you are going to a festival

147
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,880
now at the festival you obviously want

148
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,240
to buy some drinks so you take your

149
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,880
wallet with you and in your wallet you

150
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,039
put your

151
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,919
front door key now when you get back

152
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,000
home

153
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,198
at the end of the day returning from the

154
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,759
festival you want to open your front

155
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,000
door

156
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,280
and your wallet is not there anymore but

157
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,520
you have no clue

158
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,719
when it was lost so obviously you knew

159
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,159
when going out there that they're

160
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,360
probably pickpockets

161
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,800
however you don't know who in the full

162
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,639
crowd of people

163
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,320
was the pickpocket or maybe there were

164
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,360
multiple and you also don't know

165
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,360
when it was taken away from you was it

166
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,880
directly after you bought some drinks

167
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,560
was it in the bus back home

168
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,000
did you just lose your wallet or was it

169
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,919
actually stolen

170
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,840
that is really difficult to find out

171
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,960
which is often the the problem

172
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,000
with mage card schemers as well

173
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,320
so like i said there are different

174
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,600
skimmers one of them is the radix

175
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,199
skimmer which

176
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,120
sunsec first wrote about in march 2019

177
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,960
my own blog followed a few days later

178
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,000
but they are the first to publicly write

179
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,680
about this

180
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,280
and then you also have the end and

181
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,319
cockroach skimmer

182
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,758
which is written about in detail by risk

183
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,440
iq

184
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,960
a few days prior to this talk both of

185
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,719
which are linked

186
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,000
lastly the skimmer i mainly encountered

187
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,720
during my research i

188
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,400
named c my main intention here was

189
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,280
because i wanted to look into the

190
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,719
victims

191
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,638
so the affected websites and not

192
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,720
necessarily the skimmer themselves

193
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,639
i didn't dig into the skimmer this

194
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,160
skimmer and try to find out if it was

195
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,039
already named and known

196
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,680
or if this was a new one so i just kept

197
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,199
it as c

198
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,960
for this talk but there are three that i

199
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,880
mainly looked at

200
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,198
the radical skimmer will be covered the

201
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,080
loading part will be covered in a bit

202
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,840
so one of the bigger problems here is

203
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,440
the obfuscation

204
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,679
of javascript it's a really versatile

205
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,240
language you can do a lot with it

206
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,360
however if you have minimized code you

207
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,160
will also see this in

208
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,039
a lot of legitimate places additionally

209
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,039
you have a

210
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,960
open source obfuscator called

211
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,479
obfuscatorio which can

212
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,638
obfuscate your code obviously

213
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,318
and this is this is also used by

214
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,000
legitimate applications so even if you

215
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,400
were to scan

216
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,160
whatever is happening out there then it

217
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,520
becomes really difficult

218
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,520
to find which part is used and which

219
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,400
part isn't

220
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,840
by criminal actors sometimes they add

221
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,799
their code to legitimate libraries

222
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,080
sometimes they

223
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,599
keep it as is so i tackled this issue by

224
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,359
creating a private scanner and a private

225
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,880
the obfuscator for

226
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,599
some of the javascript things that i

227
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,759
encountered this will remain private due

228
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,360
to the lack of code quality

229
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,759
however if you have any questions just

230
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,440
feel free to message me personally and

231
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,880
we'll see if i can work something out

232
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,000
for you

233
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,680
so this is a screenshot of the cleaned

234
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,280
radix loader

235
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,440
as you can see a new div is created on a

236
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,758
website

237
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,639
or on a page i should say and then you

238
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,479
can see that

239
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,080
it has all the rivals that are being

240
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,000
added

241
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,960
there they have three characters in

242
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,759
length these arrivals

243
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,120
and then in the end you have the

244
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,479
decryption of sorts

245
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,560
so it basically tries to use a specific

246
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,400
radix to convert the

247
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,240
garbage that is put up front into the

248
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,599
actual screamer skimmer which is then

249
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,319
loaded

250
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,759
so the radix here is also the reason why

251
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,560
the skimmer is named this way because

252
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,240
the radix can

253
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,400
change so in this screenshot it's for

254
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,759
it's radix 36 but you can also have

255
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,400
different radixes

256
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,280
so with the same loader so it's it's

257
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,719
hard to

258
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,679
necessarily find out any

259
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,159
real reoccurring patterns in here as

260
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,359
also the name such as inner html append

261
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,200
child etc

262
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,519
are also obfuscated so that's why i said

263
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,440
this is a clean version

264
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,120
afterwards it does an integrity check to

265
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,760
see if everything went okay and only

266
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,080
then

267
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,720
the actual skimmer is present on the on

268
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,720
the website

269
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,240
so tracking campaigns is difficult

270
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,240
and as i mentioned before keep the

271
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,720
festival analogy in mind

272
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,360
now one thing that comes to mind on how

273
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,560
to best explain how to track campaigns

274
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,760
is to mention the song by fleetwood mac

275
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,359
in which they have the the line never

276
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,600
break the chain

277
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,120
now if you were to keep track of an

278
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,240
actor's steps and you want to follow

279
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,640
them live

280
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,360
then you would have to stay on top of

281
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,760
the research

282
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,800
as is with any research but the moment

283
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,399
you lose

284
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,240
the skimmer on one website or they

285
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,279
change something that doesn't link back

286
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,120
it becomes much harder because you can

287
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,519
use the latest website to

288
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,839
check which one is next by

289
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,120
cross-referencing the exfiltration point

290
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,760
however if you lose

291
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,040
track of this then you break the chain

292
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,000
and it becomes really hard

293
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,800
so think of following somebody in a

294
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,880
crowd

295
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,279
and you look away for a few seconds just

296
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,519
close your eyes for five seconds

297
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,399
you will have a really hard time finding

298
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,560
this person

299
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:59,600
even if you are able to find this person

300
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,079
so uh the chain what am i talking about

301
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,160
here

302
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,760
let me visualize this a bit more so you

303
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,600
have basically three options that i

304
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,519
displayed in two graphics

305
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,880
uh one is on the left side one is on the

306
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,240
right side

307
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,640
so the left side is there's malicious

308
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,000
javascript on the affected website

309
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,760
this can be in version one local so the

310
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,920
malicious javascript is present on the

311
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,000
hosting of the specific infected site

312
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,120
but it can also be external so you can

313
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,279
put a piece of

314
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,880
javascript somewhere and then link to it

315
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,399
from side a

316
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,640
what you can also do is in fact a cdn

317
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,880
content delivery network so by putting

318
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,360
the skimmer on there you'll immediately

319
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,839
affect

320
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,160
a lot of websites that are out there and

321
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,560
since this gamer only activates with

322
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,399
specific keywords in the url like

323
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,479
checkout then it doesn't activate on

324
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,880
websites that are not a web shop but it

325
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,200
does activate on web shops

326
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,120
so this is favorable for the criminal

327
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,720
but in a sense it's also favorable for

328
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,079
the researcher because

329
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,839
having a infected cdn makes it much

330
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,319
much more likely that at least somebody

331
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,279
will notice and tweet about it

332
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,120
or research it by themselves and then

333
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,120
find out that this is ongoing

334
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,120
however by infecting a cdn you're also

335
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,240
infecting usually

336
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:20,320
more high value targets so that's where

337
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,800
it becomes a bit of a gray area as it

338
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,440
what is

339
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,199
the most beneficial for researchers

340
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,839
whereas obviously the most beneficial is

341
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,160
that people would stop doing criminal

342
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,680
activity

343
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,920
but allah i don't foresee that happen

344
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,959
so tracking campaigns in the beginning i

345
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,839
worked together with

346
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:42,479
jacob pimental on the 20th of january he

347
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,480
found a website that had a skimmer on it

348
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,360
and he asked me for help so we dug into

349
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,880
it together

350
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,560
and we found that a website that was

351
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,439
reselling tickets

352
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,638
was infected then we used this

353
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,880
exfiltration domain

354
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:59,440
to find more and then risk iq

355
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,120
also blogged about the findings that we

356
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,160
had and elaborated more on this with

357
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,000
their research

358
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,199
and we elaborated on their research

359
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,120
again

360
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,800
then on the 24th of february i wrote a

361
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,440
blog by myself

362
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,959
about more details that i found and

363
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,639
after that i wanted to

364
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:19,040
see how far the reach was of this

365
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,880
this group thus far so i started

366
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,760
backtracking so instead of following the

367
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,920
live activities i went back in time

368
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,880
and i found websites that were infected

369
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,279
roughly

370
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,800
until two years ago at the time of

371
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:35,279
writing which was earlier this year

372
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,839
so the result of that analysis so this

373
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,160
is the

374
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:43,040
the backtracking part it had 1236

375
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,760
affected websites and i split them into

376
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,319
multiple

377
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,600
groups now notably the products group is

378
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,839
the biggest which also makes

379
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,360
the most sense in the example i gave a

380
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,720
t-shirt it's something you can order

381
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,360
with a credit card or

382
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,959
a new gaming console or hardware or any

383
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,720
of the other

384
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,319
things that you might need however

385
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,839
services as well as

386
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,360
food are generally not ordered with a

387
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,200
credit card

388
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,200
especially services you require a bit of

389
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,959
negotiation and talking about

390
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,839
what the party can provide for you what

391
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,839
you need so it's not like a

392
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,560
shopping basket on a webshop where you

393
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,720
just order a service and go

394
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,399
roughly 10 was unknown i couldn't find

395
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,040
anything about these websites but i knew

396
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,800
they had been

397
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,719
infected at some point in time but they

398
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,880
might have been down at that point

399
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,440
and i want to have a specific mention of

400
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,439
the adult entertainment

401
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,040
websites that were infected because like

402
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,000
i said you also

403
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,439
provide usually your address where you

404
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,680
live your full name

405
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,440
aside from your credit card credentials

406
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,319
all this information is

407
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,680
exfiltrated by the skimmer meaning this

408
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,360
information is somewhere

409
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,839
but not in all places on the in the

410
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,639
world it's legal to

411
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,000
have a relationship with somebody of a

412
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,120
specific gender

413
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,079
depending on the gender you have so

414
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,760
this is additionally a vector for them

415
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,760
to be vulnerable which is why i want to

416
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,600
mention it separately

417
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,199
if we look at the geographical location

418
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,199
i looked at the headquarters of each

419
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,000
affected company

420
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,319
which was a tedious task too manually

421
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,199
but

422
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,720
i wanted to have a reliable data set now

423
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,639
if we can see here

424
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,760
then we see that a lot of countries

425
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,480
across the world have been

426
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,319
affected and we see that by far the

427
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,959
darkest spot on the map meaning it's the

428
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,600
most

429
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,959
impacted is the united states of america

430
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,399
with 303

431
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,880
infections now this is also

432
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,800
logical on the one hand because the

433
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,399
united states have a tendency to do a

434
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,639
lot with their credit cards they buy

435
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,440
a lot with credit cards so it makes more

436
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,839
sense to

437
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,560
from an attacker's perspective to target

438
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,160
a

439
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,760
united states webshop because you have

440
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,040
the most chance so if i compare that

441
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,199
with the netherlands

442
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,199
we mostly use debit cards so it doesn't

443
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:59,279
really make too much sense to

444
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:00,800
start hosting credit card schemers here

445
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,639
however we also have to take into

446
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,479
account that this data is not normalized

447
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,320
so the united states has a population of

448
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,079
more than 300 million

449
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,600
whereas the netherlands only has 17

450
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,839
million so logically

451
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,079
they will have more affected websites as

452
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,440
well

453
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,839
now lastly i want to talk a bit about

454
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,800
the economic implications that there are

455
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,440
so you basically have four groups of

456
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,479
people

457
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,160
that are affected by fraud so you have

458
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,720
the actor who

459
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,519
purely aims to make profit uh by doing

460
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,920
this

461
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,920
then you have the individual it can be

462
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,719
you or me whoever owns a credit card

463
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,439
and they lose money because of this then

464
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,199
you have the

465
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,600
the bank which has the credit cards

466
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,880
and they want to avoid fraud and combat

467
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,320
this as well

468
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,920
and lastly you have the merchant who is

469
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,199
the web shop

470
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,959
and the webshop obviously has to make

471
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,758
sure their security is in order

472
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,599
so as a report by mastercard said 77

473
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,639
percent of the cases they investigate

474
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,639
the merchant had not kept their software

475
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:05,360
secure and up to date this means that

476
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,720
they have a lack of security and this

477
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,639
can also mean that they are

478
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,800
fined for all of the fraudulent

479
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,120
transactions that took place

480
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,399
going as far as bankrupting them in case

481
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,639
of smaller companies

482
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,519
and in case of bigger companies you can

483
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:23,120
get fines so recent fines were

484
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,040
the 20 million pound fine for british

485
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,040
airways and a 1.25

486
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:33,120
pound fine 1.25 million pound fine

487
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:36,160
for ticketmaster lastly i want to talk a

488
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,000
bit about the indirect collaboration

489
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,240
all of the sources mentioned are based

490
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,360
on the first i could find

491
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,240
and i do disregard private data sets

492
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,279
i specifically want to talk willem

493
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,839
jordan

494
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,199
and jonathan for their help with

495
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,600
answering my questions

496
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,240
and other help they've given me i also

497
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,800
want to thank

498
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,680
jerome specifically as well as jacob and

499
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,319
of here for

500
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,319
helping me out with research and also

501
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,680
reviewing the material

502
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,280
if there are any questions you can ask

503
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,280
them in the chat and i'll get back to

504
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,280
