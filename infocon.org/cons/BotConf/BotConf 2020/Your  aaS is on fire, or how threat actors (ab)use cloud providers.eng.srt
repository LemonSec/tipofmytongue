1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,480
good morning good evening whatever suits

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,919
your time zone today i'll be talking

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,840
about how fred actress abuse cloud

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,678
services

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,440
my name is machikotovic i work as a mall

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,639
researcher in manuallab.pl

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,560
where i'm trying to help people with

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,680
their manual problems so if you have any

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,160
don't hesitate to reach out

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,080
maybe we can help besides working with

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,560
malware i'm doing various projects on

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,639
play ctfc's dragon sector and that will

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,198
be enough about me let's

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,480
begin our journey

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,520
so let's start with some ideas

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,120
where and when we can use cloud services

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,000
so this is the picture most of you

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,839
probably are familiar with

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,800
kill chain infection chain whatever you

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,399
wanna whichever name you prefer

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,000
um it's a basic list of steps

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,760
basically this list of steps you need to

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,280
take um or

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,960
you will take in order to to

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,160
successfully compromise the machine or

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,359
whatever target is

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,399
whatever is your target uh and

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,320
we have like those um seven

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,159
simple steps right named reconnaissance

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,880
symbolization delivery exploitation

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,320
installation command control and

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,240
finally doing some actions on an

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,600
objective um

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,798
then they are pretty straightforward

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,798
right reconnaissance will be like

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,920
gathering information about targets

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,119
and um what software they're using

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,040
what you know names of documents are

39
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,400
passing in stuff like that so whatever

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:34,400
gives you enough information to uh

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,400
to successfully influence

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:42,159
your influence your delivery method

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,798
optimization will be like gathering some

44
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,399
tools that will be we'll be needing to

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,159
compromise target

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,920
delivery obviously the way how how we

47
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,320
wanna um

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,680
how we wanna deliver the malware or

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,199
exploit or whatever

50
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,119
itself mostly like you'll be

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,960
spearfishing emails or you know watering

52
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,520
hole attack whatever

53
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,880
um some sort of exploitation will be

54
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,560
happening like user clicking

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,199
macro so what's not but not uh

56
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,878
later on it would install some stuff

57
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,359
some of this stuff will call to

58
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,920
c2 for comments or just saying okay it's

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,480
there

60
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,119
what's next and at the end the attacker

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,640
will do some

62
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:24,400
some actions on an objective

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,119
and in case of um

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,000
the most attackers the that the most

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,040
attackers who

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,840
follow this this chain or somehow state

67
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,959
sponsored or

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,319
have some concrete objective that will

69
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,800
be some sort of

70
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,000
gathering data and exploration well at

71
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,040
least part of those

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,560
those actions will be explication

73
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,920
and a few of those steps are in few of

74
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,519
those steps you can actually use

75
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,518
some cloud services to help either stay

76
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,319
under the radar or

77
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,000
speed up from preparation for attack or

78
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,799
stuff like off or

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:07,599
just have a nice storage of data

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:12,400
that will be untraceable for example

81
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:15,280
um so i'm thinking about

82
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,879
i'll try to try to show you in which

83
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,040
steps

84
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:23,280
actors can use cloud services and

85
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,879
later on we'll try to i'll try to show

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,760
you some examples of how

87
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,120
what actors i found and well interesting

88
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,239
actors i found

89
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,440
at least from my point of view

90
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,480
i found using and abusing um those

91
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,480
methods

92
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,920
so first start with fuponization

93
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,440
obviously we can go

94
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,640
which is as i said a way of finding

95
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,239
creating um some sort of exploits or

96
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,798
malware

97
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,080
and the best source of that is basically

98
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,879
obviously open source

99
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:59,519
if you want to stay under the rider

100
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,000
and today's i guess kind of hot debate

101
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,720
about

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040
if uh offensive research is good or not

103
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,480
so

104
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,040
this is something i actually won't be

105
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,439
talking about today i just will mention

106
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
it

107
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,640
as one of the actors using it but

108
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,519
nothing nothing more important nothing

109
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,359
there

110
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,200
and i'll talk a little bit more about

111
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,479
deliver itself delivery

112
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,839
uh as in this case this step

113
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:24,159
um actors can use

114
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,679
um cloud services for example for

115
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,720
hosting

116
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,080
uh their their their stuff

117
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,639
be it code lures whatever but also they

118
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,240
can use

119
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:39,440
image of cloud providers and abuse

120
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,880
this image to to create some sort of

121
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,639
trust relationship with a user they are

122
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,759
not they want to attack

123
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,240
so it will be more inclined to click on

124
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,040
the link

125
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:56,240
for example and situs obviously

126
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,639
you can host just the regular situations

127
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,240
like

128
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,360
you know some crappy php scripts uh on

129
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,639
various uh free hostings

130
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,080
or various bus platform or whatever but

131
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,080
we can also use

132
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,840
and something that attackers start to

133
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,960
using is uh creating some

134
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,560
non-traditional institutes like um

135
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,198
abusing or basically using some metadata

136
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,520
of

137
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,360
um cloud service or files hosting the

138
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,280
cloud service itself

139
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,120
to hide chemical communication in plain

140
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,198
sight

141
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,440
and at the end as i said the exploration

142
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,400
is some sort of

143
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,600
is one of the things that has to happen

144
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,320
so exfiltration

145
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,919
is another place we can actually use use

146
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,719
cloud services

147
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,719
and one of the most like them

148
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,479
one of the obvious steps would be just

149
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,120
to upload data to some

150
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,880
some some clouds and you know hides the

151
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,800
the actual

152
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,560
um actually well uh

153
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,479
expectation of data because this will

154
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,840
there will be a main request to the

155
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,840
normal uh normal service

156
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,198
this concept i'll try to to illustrate

157
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,160
with

158
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,160
a couple actors and couple mowers and

159
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,840
one fret actor sorry

160
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,280
the first one will be um x drive then

161
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,680
we'll go with neural which is

162
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,119
a malware and i will try to say why it's

163
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,960
i believe it's

164
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,240
operated by gaza gank and then we'll go

165
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,799
with fishing elephant

166
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:44,639
which is very funny actor i think

167
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,280
and i don't i'm not sure about

168
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,400
anything being published about any of

169
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,159
those besides

170
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,239
the fishing elephant that i did couple

171
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,120
of conferences

172
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,000
in the last couple of months okay let's

173
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,280
go

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,720
xdrive we'll go for a whole infection

175
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,119
chain

176
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,120
and i'll give you some nice uh

177
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,120
pointers for what was what was going

178
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,520
there so it started

179
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,560
as most of the attacks with some sort of

180
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,719
superfishing

181
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,520
and you know document with macros

182
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,000
and some sort of social engineering

183
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,639
attempts to do to con

184
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,840
to force user to click and run the

185
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,680
macros

186
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,440
so you have like this document with

187
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,240
enable content to

188
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,000
blah blah blah under there there is a

189
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,919
very simple macro

190
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,199
and that will download two files from

191
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,318
dropbox

192
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,400
and dropbox is one of the services

193
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,599
i will be talking while mentioning

194
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,000
actually quite a lot

195
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,360
today it's it seems to be like one of

196
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,560
the go to um

197
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,919
hosting's file hosting um

198
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:57,440
providers for uh products both

199
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,479
crimeware and and nation state apts

200
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,919
what's not

201
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:05,520
but so it will download two files and

202
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:08,560
one will be msi

203
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,520
and which is basically installer with

204
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,879
forexa

205
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:17,039
and other will be bad script

206
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,039
so pretty simple stuff

207
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,638
so let me try to show it to you

208
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:28,000
right so this is this simple script

209
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:31,120
it does basically runs the msi msi will

210
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,360
unpack to file exile.xz

211
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,200
and we have the malware and the mouse is

212
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,360
actually interesting but

213
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,519
um so it's actually a very simple one

214
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,760
it's validator slash

215
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,880
slash rat downloader whatever you want

216
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,480
to name it

217
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,240
but it's like the first stage malware

218
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,160
that will be dropped on a target in

219
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,360
order to um

220
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,120
to understand what what happened and

221
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,040
if you can do anything funny with this

222
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,360
this this

223
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,599
this compromise machine so what will we

224
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,560
do it has like these four comments

225
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,000
it can download url download file from

226
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,040
the url

227
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,800
directly from bytes in

228
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,880
uh uh comment and write it to the file

229
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,120
and then execute it

230
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,439
take a screenshot and execute some

231
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,440
comments

232
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,959
the results will be uploaded to a

233
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,640
hard-coded

234
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:29,839
google drive for attacker

235
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,000
to to write a fetch it fetch it

236
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,880
and the actual c2 channel is very

237
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,440
interesting

238
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,240
at least quite unusual for me so what

239
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,480
will happen

240
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,320
and then beginning of the infection the

241
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,200
malware will create will fingerprint the

242
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,880
machine

243
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,480
get some data about you know like the

244
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,320
username computer name

245
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,760
some information about install viruses

246
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,080
stuff like that

247
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:55,279
and we'll create a paste and a paste bin

248
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,720
with those informations encoded i think

249
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:02,320
um so attacker can go there

250
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,120
obviously it's using using some api key

251
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,399
with you know

252
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,040
some registered account and

253
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,000
so the attacker knows which which

254
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,199
account to

255
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,880
to to follow so he's like you know

256
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,279
listing the the new pace if it cup

257
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,720
if it happens the new place came in he

258
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,560
will

259
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,200
read it if it's interesting it will uh

260
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,000
execute issue some comments to the

261
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,120
malware

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,680
by modifying the paste which

263
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,440
later will be read read by malware

264
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,000
decoded the code and you know that the

265
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,360
comments will be

266
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,640
will be executed so this gives you quite

267
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,800
a nice

268
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,800
the whole infection chain looks pretty

269
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,560
pretty valid if you have only network

270
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,480
defense

271
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,920
so from there will be there will be no

272
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,000
suspicious traffic at all no

273
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:59,040
no known c2 connects and what's not

274
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,079
uh so that's pretty pretty nice

275
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,079
way of bypassing the network uh defense

276
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,199
i never i only found like two or three

277
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,160
free cases of this malware

278
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,839
um it's written in dotnet packed with

279
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,760
some

280
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,959
some uh

281
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,000
customized merby or something like that

282
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,479
version of

283
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,839
confusers who there is like there's

284
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,360
nothing nothing super

285
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,440
um super advanced

286
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,200
and there was no files on the drive and

287
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,120
the paste is already

288
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,600
dead but i don't know like i never found

289
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,040
more done than this which is kind of

290
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,560
upsetting because i like that

291
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:46,480
i like it how it creates this attack

292
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,079
well on to the next one

293
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,519
and this one actually has some some

294
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,839
backstory and

295
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,560
the backstory goes like that beginning

296
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,200
of the year

297
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,599
there was a research published by talos

298
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,680
about

299
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,079
jonard and it was a new python rat that

300
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,599
they found

301
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,959
and they described it in details was

302
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,320
very nice nice blog you can

303
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,719
you should definitely read it if you

304
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,240
didn't did not yet

305
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,399
and but this i was working working on

306
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,240
this case actually at the same time

307
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,240
and they basic um

308
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,320
as they mentioned that the man they're

309
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,839
mentioning

310
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,079
that um in their analysis that the

311
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,600
document well probably everything

312
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,920
started with this small

313
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,800
dots x document because it's you know

314
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,279
something

315
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:42,479
on everyone's watch list i guess

316
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:45,600
being uploaded to virus of course and

317
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:50,480
you know it's a very interesting uh

318
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:53,360
document it has the analysis this

319
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,720
is quite well the malware itself is that

320
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,040
the document is quite nice that

321
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,680
how they do infection um but

322
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,480
it was um unique enough so i can found

323
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,920
like finger

324
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,399
created some sort of signature and

325
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,839
search for other and stuff

326
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,600
and i found those document couple

327
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,600
documents uh

328
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,519
this is except from my notes back from

329
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,760
from from beginning of the year

330
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,720
and the one we'll be talking about today

331
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,720
is this one actually

332
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
17-12

333
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:32,000
which is which was

334
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,000
netrat not python so that's something

335
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
that stood up

336
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,399
um let's go with this story

337
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,199
so it was this in the same same fashion

338
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,360
that was a

339
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,120
file that has a remote content hosted on

340
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,440
google drive

341
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,720
you can fetch it if you manage to fetch

342
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,519
it

343
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,320
you get a document with a macro macro

344
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,639
was pretty

345
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,240
simple again it will just call to the

346
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,680
github

347
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,959
and download executable that will be

348
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,560
later run or decode it from base64 and

349
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:09,199
run and the document is

350
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,319
there that file is not there but you

351
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,399
have the hash and i

352
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,279
think it's on the virustotal so you can

353
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,199
find it later on

354
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,040
the malware was pretty simple it's a

355
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,279
first stage validator again

356
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,719
and fingerprints machine downloads files

357
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:28,079
and execute commands like

358
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,079
every every um every validator

359
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,239
but it has a little bit uh more into it

360
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,160
it has a very nice c2 channel

361
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,760
so they create a very nice situation

362
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,480
which is

363
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,519
and in the way i actually didn't think

364
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,800
about

365
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,720
and it's the first time i saw something

366
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,839
like that so let's go with

367
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,560
about that sorry

368
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,320
so what they did they created a channel

369
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,638
that was based on the files on google

370
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,279
drive

371
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,000
when the bots get started starts

372
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,120
infection

373
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,800
infection it will create the directory

374
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,480
on a google drive

375
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,160
um with a bot id

376
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,839
like the the name of the directory was

377
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,480
the bot id and under the

378
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,920
this directory there will be a bunch of

379
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,040
will be created a bunch of different

380
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,880
files

381
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,360
uh with a diff with a specific mime type

382
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,399
and it will be searching through this

383
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,639
drive

384
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,320
uh for different mind types in order to

385
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,040
understand what commands were issued to

386
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,399
him

387
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,920
to the bot um mind

388
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,399
and if you like a bunch of those those

389
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,399
mime types

390
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,199
with and you know that's

391
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,279
[Music]

392
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,199
some synchronization going on and

393
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,959
possibility to download tools

394
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,479
uh information when the bot was last

395
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,119
seen everything that's

396
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,720
basically needed to have a functioning

397
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,120
c2 channel

398
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,320
but as i said it's quite unique to use

399
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,600
mime types not

400
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:01,360
the files so if you don't examine

401
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:05,120
the files carefully you have like just

402
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,600
some pictures or whatever but the whole

403
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:12,240
magic is this is in

404
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:15,680
in the mime types which is quite nice

405
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,399
um and

406
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,439
i query the this this google drive see

407
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,680
what's happening it's

408
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:26,959
still available so you can you can get

409
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,519
some files from there um

410
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,719
there were a bunch of tools most of them

411
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,320
were quasar at

412
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:37,279
some packed and some

413
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,759
yeah mostly packed or obfuscated or

414
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,439
whatnot

415
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:44,560
like typical quasar stuff um

416
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,440
nothing fancy there there was some situs

417
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,279
and c2s at some point turns out to be

418
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,519
related to more rats

419
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,920
or gaza gang or whatever you want to

420
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,920
call them

421
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,079
but the most important at the time i was

422
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,000
analyzing it was this file

423
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:06,799
google e which turns out to be

424
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,720
a uh evolution of x-gaza which is a

425
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,959
kaspersky name for spark

426
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,079
and this tool is uh it's uniquely

427
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,640
attributed to two gaza gangs so that's

428
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,520
how i that's why attributing this neural

429
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,319
malware

430
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,319
together or more luts

431
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,199
and the name of the neural and the name

432
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,760
of the previous one the x-drive came

433
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,760
from this

434
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,320
this this um this

435
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,280
kind of email address uh and you can see

436
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,320
here

437
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:44,160
uh it's actually a login or

438
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,159
a user id of the of the

439
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:52,480
google computing engine that's created

440
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:55,600
by attackers uh

441
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,840
in order to use google's app

442
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,600
to to to interact with the with the

443
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,639
services

444
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,959
okay the next one where's my

445
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,960
mouse

446
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,240
the next one will be fishing elephant

447
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,480
and i will go through

448
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,520
quickly with three of those come through

449
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,520
their campaigns

450
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:22,480
and their exploration method um

451
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,840
more of i'll try to be brief in on that

452
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,559
more you can find on

453
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,959
my talks about phishing elephant itself

454
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,918
in

455
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,880
on different conferences all right so

456
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,039
the first campaign was

457
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,960
quite unique the one actually that

458
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,000
caught my eye

459
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,000
and made this

460
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,400
kind of whole research possible because

461
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,320
it looks interesting

462
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,799
uh it was a spearfishing emails with a

463
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,159
fake link to affect google drive

464
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:56,160
and under this link like this dots

465
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:59,200
docs dash op whatever whatever

466
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,320
um they hosted a simple

467
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,200
html file that will be uh

468
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,320
they look like look look like google

469
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,080
drive

470
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:13,280
download um

471
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,879
um site and and

472
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,678
and will redirect you if the user click

473
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,720
download that will

474
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:24,000
be redirected to hta script that

475
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,080
will be responsible for getting

476
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,280
malware and running malware on the file

477
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,000
on the drive

478
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,200
uh on the hard drive of the or whatever

479
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,520
type of drive

480
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,200
uh on the compute infected computer and

481
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,240
firing up the browser that will

482
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,120
be calling again

483
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,400
tax to actual google drive in order to

484
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,639
show the

485
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:50,559
uh the lure on the fake

486
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,880
invoice in this case um

487
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,240
the campaign was about sending cvs so

488
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,000
they had like bunch of

489
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,679
prepared bunch of cvs that they hosted

490
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,960
on google drive

491
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,360
and it will be look it looked quite bang

492
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,840
from point of uh

493
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,039
from a viewpoint of being the one that's

494
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,678
being attacked

495
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,720
so there was nothing suspicious and the

496
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,360
infection could go

497
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,360
undetected

498
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,159
the payload was the link for the final

499
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,960
payload was

500
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,600
hindered under bitly and sometimes

501
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,000
others

502
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,158
and the host pilot was hosted on cloud

503
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,520
storage services like dropbox and exists

504
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,880
classes web storage

505
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,440
and uh

506
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,000
and similar and at the end they dropped

507
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,120
rs rats which is a very simple

508
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,120
python rats that you can found find

509
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:49,840
in on github

510
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,840
um second campaign a little bit less

511
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,720
fancy i guess it was just a document

512
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,799
with maybe internal names and current

513
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,080
events

514
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,440
but no not no there was no fancy scheme

515
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,918
like

516
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,640
redirects to the google fake google

517
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,760
drive or whatnot it was just a simple

518
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:15,440
document in an email with dte

519
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:18,559
in order to fetch some batch script on

520
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,520
hosted on dropbox and execute it

521
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,520
later on we'll get the

522
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:28,480
vbs script vbscript that will get

523
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,440
malware on our disk and run it so in the

524
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,280
same

525
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,200
style almost the same styles in the

526
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:37,280
previous case

527
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,760
um there was no decoys you name it

528
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,799
on the in the documents it was just a

529
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,320
blank page so this

530
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:47,520
was this was kind of suspicious um

531
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,399
and they moved from powershell to bits

532
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:53,679
admin for for downloading and

533
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,240
stayed again used bitly for for

534
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,240
hindering

535
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,760
the final urls and dropped iris rods as

536
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,600
a final pilot a little

537
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,600
the last notification in the campaign

538
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,520
number three

539
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,000
but basically the same stuff was number

540
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,280
two um but there was an intermediary

541
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,799
step added as that will do some

542
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,360
geofencing and so if you the request

543
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,440
came from

544
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,879
the country they are not interested in

545
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,520
they will

546
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,679
the request will be redirected to the

547
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,960
simple the script that will

548
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,360
start windows update if

549
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,720
the country was of their interest they

550
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:40,000
will be redirected

551
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:41,280
to other script that will basically do

552
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,120
the same stuff as previously

553
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:47,120
which is download file from dropbox

554
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,320
this time the file was actually the file

555
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,120
of the binary was actually encoded with

556
00:22:52,320 --> 00:23:00,240
base64 and

557
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,239
was mimicking mimicking

558
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:08,960
was me making a certificate so

559
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,679
they can use certutil uh to decode it

560
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,679
and you know

561
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,679
uh yeah so if someone doesn't

562
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,280
uh is not looking for it they will be

563
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,720
missed they will miss the

564
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,399
the moment that they actually creating

565
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,799
the executable on

566
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,799
the disk

567
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,400
okay

568
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,960
so those three campaigns they were quite

569
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,080
successful actually i saw a lot of

570
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,440
victims from it

571
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,960
well a lot in terms of um target attacks

572
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,440
which is you know

573
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:46,559
in quantity of tens not not hundreds

574
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,679
but i saw some victims um

575
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:52,320
so after after some time the victim will

576
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,279
if the victim was interesting they will

577
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,279
get this

578
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,679
command that will download another free

579
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:01,039
files from dropbox

580
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,840
and two of those files were totally

581
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,640
non-malicious that will be

582
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:11,760
system.exe or and tmp.xe with the real

583
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:14,480
names airclone xzn7z

584
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,840
the first one is a compiled binary of

585
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,520
airclone

586
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:23,439
and the second one is 7zip obviously and

587
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:27,840
the airclone is actually a tool

588
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:31,600
used for managing cloud

589
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:34,158
disks so like like different storages

590
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,639
one of those would be google drive so

591
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,360
after

592
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,679
this this script on the top the victim

593
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,520
will get the second script

594
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,360
and the script will basically iterate

595
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,480
over interesting files

596
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,399
pack them and upload it to google drive

597
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,440
using this this

598
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,440
airclone utility

599
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,080
the nice thing about this utility is

600
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,360
it's written in

601
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,639
in rust although it's in go so

602
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,559
call link so it's it's com it's

603
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:10,000
statically compiled so it can run

604
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:12,879
on any decent decently new

605
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,080
system window system obviously so they

606
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,440
can just drop the binary

607
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,960
and be done with all the um all the

608
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,960
exfiltration process pretty nice

609
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,279
they are still operating and but i

610
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,840
cannot find any more

611
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,200
evidence of their infection like the the

612
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,039
first stages of infection

613
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,760
i don't know um

614
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,480
well you see so see some examples how to

615
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,720
use

616
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,640
cloud services um let's talk a little

617
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,760
bit about pros and cons about

618
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,320
this approach and it will be from the

619
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,039
attacker

620
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,439
viewpoint because it's kind of easy to

621
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,799
think

622
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,960
in that way so the big plus

623
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,840
is obviously that most of them are free

624
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,960
or

625
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,080
almost free quite easy to set up

626
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,679
and you need just couple clicks to be uh

627
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,399
to have a working hosting

628
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,400
or disk storage or whatever you need

629
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,120
they are most of the time easy

630
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,880
scriptable

631
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,639
easily scriptable because that's how

632
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,760
they are designed

633
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,919
and so you have either quite easy it's

634
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,559
quite easy to create automated way to

635
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,960
analyze your assets or you know have

636
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,879
keep taps on your assets in this case

637
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,400
would be import for example bots

638
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,400
new bots um from

639
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,600
outsider it's point of view it's kinda

640
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,080
hard to figure it out

641
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,039
uh if the link belongs to attacker or

642
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,720
not so if it's

643
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,559
a good link or not for example

644
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,760
you see the links from dropbox there is

645
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,799
no way of knowing

646
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,919
who the owner is what the file is

647
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,039
unless and until you access it in case

648
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,919
of google drive you

649
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,760
get the same more or less similar file

650
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,240
structure but you can get some metadata

651
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,600
which i'll be talking about later on

652
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,520
uh in a few minutes and you know

653
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,039
if you use open source malware you can

654
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,240
kiss code attribution goodbye

655
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:10,240
obviously and it's actually hard to get

656
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,520
the provider to take down an account or

657
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,520
files that they're hosting

658
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,760
with actually no tables exception of

659
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:22,240
heroku which i

660
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,240
worked pretty closely we

661
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,360
they get concerned about phishing

662
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,039
elephants using their infrastructure so

663
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,760
they managed to

664
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,480
create some scripts and some signatures

665
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,799
to to

666
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,080
find out their activities and later on

667
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,360
kick them out from from from the

668
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,120
infrastructure

669
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,439
which was which was a nice surprise and

670
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,239
obviously if there are pluses there are

671
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,200
minuses

672
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,799
and the minuses for the attacker is if

673
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,520
the researcher know where to look

674
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,639
most of those services leaves a lot of

675
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,360
metadata

676
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,440
quite a lot of metadata for example

677
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,399
google drive will give you

678
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,919
email addresses with the ids of the

679
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:03,360
account that create the files

680
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,480
but also timestamps of creation and

681
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,479
modification so that

682
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,840
gives you some ideas of timeframe from

683
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,159
attack

684
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,039
and but the bigger biggest problem is

685
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,240
that api

686
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,279
some sort of api keys are encryption

687
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,640
keys or whatever

688
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,399
some sort of keys are needed for

689
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,440
accessing those resources

690
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:24,399
and if you don't know how to

691
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,679
properly secure them or configure them

692
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,840
you'll give

693
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,399
sorry i'll give a lot of access to

694
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,760
researchers

695
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:36,719
uh to the data that they should not see

696
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,919
for example you can see call all of c2

697
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,240
or take down or remove all the c2

698
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,440
if you didn't secure give proper access

699
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,039
rights to the

700
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,799
api keys you are embedding them into

701
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,320
malware

702
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,480
and as i said the cloud provider

703
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,399
operators have a little bit

704
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,480
of a bit different visibility than

705
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,320
typical hosters so if you buy a

706
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,480
dedicated software

707
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,559
uh you're basically done with it right

708
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,559
what the anything that

709
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,760
all of the things that can be done by

710
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,120
the hoster is basically

711
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,480
remove your account clean your machine

712
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,479
but you know the cloud providers can

713
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,919
like if they host they're doing some sas

714
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,000
or pass

715
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,440
services they can monitor what you're

716
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,360
doing

717
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,480
or other things that they have uh

718
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,158
insight into but so

719
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,200
the insight is quite quite unique and

720
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,520
that can be

721
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,600
used for good in terms of you know

722
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,760
finding but guys

723
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,678

725
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,960
little bit
