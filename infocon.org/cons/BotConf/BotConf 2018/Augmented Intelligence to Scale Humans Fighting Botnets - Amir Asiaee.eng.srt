1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,109
when everyone my name is Amira CIE and

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:11,070
I'm a data scientist that nominal which

3
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:13,860
is now part of Akamai today I will

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:20,150
present the work of our team on behalf

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:22,590
of URI Hong Kong and Alexey the title of

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:25,528
my presentation is augmented

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,340
intelligence to scale human fighting

8
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:31,800
botnets

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:35,129
I know we've heard about malware's quite

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:40,590
a bit in the past couple of days so I'm

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:45,510
just gonna go with the trend so we're

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:48,450
trying to address the problem of too

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,839
many hours but unfortunately too many

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:57,600
too few security researchers to be able

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:01,410
to catch them and this growing threat so

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:05,869
I will talk about how we're scaling up

17
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:11,310
our approach with intelligent machines

18
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:14,340
I'll focus on three key steps that leads

19
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,540
us to our destination and I will show

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:22,650
you some real-life examples of how we

21
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:27,119
detect and block botnets with some cool

22
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:30,000
visualizations so a little bit about nom

23
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:34,920
nom now part of Akamai did the science

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,189
and security team at nominal we receive

25
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:43,110
and process about a hundred billion DNS

26
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:47,339
queries per day in real time so quite

27
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:52,020
large scale of data this data comes from

28
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:56,009
our global partner ice Pease around the

29
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,869
globe mostly and the majority of data

30
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:03,780
comes from the our Havana to cache

31
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:09,478
servers and it's often anonymized this

32
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:12,900
data is sample of 1.5 roughly 1.5

33
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,650
trillion DNS queries that we're serving

34
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,819
paper

35
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:22,590
day so as you can see we have a good

36
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:24,810
visibility of global data that is the

37
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:30,650
key to solve many of the security

38
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:33,959
problems that we see on the Internet

39
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:38,250
so what is the problem the main problem

40
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:41,239
is that members are moving so fast

41
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,239
they're evolving so fast

42
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:49,619
the main notion of domain generation

43
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:54,540
algorithms or GGAs are running well out

44
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:57,720
there and they're almost getting out of

45
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:03,149
control so we need to find a way to

46
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:07,560
fight them back in in in this and this

47
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:11,220
way we've seen in the past like a few

48
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:14,250
years that the lifetime of malware C and

49
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,250
C and C and C's has becoming shorter and

50
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:20,819
shorter and we've seen campaigns that

51
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:24,480
come for just a few hours and lasts and

52
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:25,768
they're gone and we don't see a trail of

53
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,000
them anymore

54
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:33,500
similarly for malicious ad campaigns

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:41,669
they've become very short life and

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:45,690
they're everywhere so on the right side

57
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:48,150
you can see a bunch of domain names I'm

58
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:51,209
not sure if you can clearly see it but

59
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:54,239
if you can see please let me know if

60
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:56,690
they're part of any about any malware's

61
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,769
because we tag them as malicious but

62
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:04,620
they're not part of any known malware so

63
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:09,620
if you could let us know that would be

64
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:13,379
great so the traditional approach is to

65
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:19,340
do reverse engineering but it's not

66
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:22,409
enough due to the fast growth of the

67
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:24,520
threats that that we see they move too

68
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:27,819
fast and

69
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:31,180
we don't have enough security

70
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:35,440
researchers to detect them and block

71
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:40,349
them so our solution is to scale up the

72
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,349
human power and intelligence by machines

73
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:54,270
so in our approach we focus on three

74
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:59,340
keys in order to unlock the magic box of

75
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:02,289
threats the first key would be our

76
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:05,440
correlation engine so we build something

77
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:08,099
called a correlation engine that is

78
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,110
built using their real-time DNS traffic

79
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:17,319
we build a machine learning model based

80
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:20,680
on that and we see a lot of new domains

81
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:23,620
every day and we try to capture them in

82
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,289
real-time and keep track of them

83
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:31,360
that's the second key of our approach

84
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:34,419
and the third key is our clustering the

85
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,930
new domains that comes to us we're

86
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:40,719
trying to find a way to cluster them and

87
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:46,509
detect them as malware's in addition to

88
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:49,349
that we enhance our approach with with

89
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:53,889
the security community and our

90
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:56,400
third-party partners that helps us in

91
00:05:53,889 --> 00:06:00,130
labeling our death threats and

92
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,150
specifically partners that we detect as

93
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:06,099
a result we're gonna have a enriched

94
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:12,789
threat intelligence that will serve our

95
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:18,219
customers and secure them and in a very

96
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:21,520
quick time so our correlation engine the

97
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:25,030
main goal is to be able to represent all

98
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,669
domain names that come through our DNS

99
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:31,750
traffic in order to calculate some sort

100
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:34,089
of correlation between them so we can we

101
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:38,290
can later on cluster and group them

102
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:41,520
together our approaches is inspired by

103
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:45,580
or to back which is widely used in

104
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,099
natural language processing so the key

105
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,830
is to be able to maximize the

106
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:53,500
co-occurrence probability of the DNS

107
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:58,450
query sequence that we get so let's say

108
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:03,010
for every 10 minutes we try to rebuild

109
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:06,900
our model based on say 10 minutes stop

110
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:12,099
shot of the global DNS traffic and then

111
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:16,630
using that we will try to do the

112
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:20,460
clustering later the benefits of this

113
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:23,500
approach is that it's very robust

114
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:27,719
against noise for example the legitimate

115
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:32,380
domains will show very low correlation

116
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:35,920
to malicious domains which is the goal

117
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:38,409
that we're after so the model that we

118
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:42,370
built is going to be both sensitive to

119
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:45,700
high rank such as like very high ranked

120
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:49,900
domains out there and long tail domains

121
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:54,789
that we see quite a few of them in the

122
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:58,359
traffic and main benefit of our approach

123
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:01,750
is that there is no requirement for

124
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:04,060
predefined knowledge so we just learned

125
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:09,150
from everything that comes through the

126
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:14,020
our DNS traffic so how do we learn these

127
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:17,650
representations as I said the input we

128
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:21,690
can assume to be the DNS sequence that

129
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:29,620
we get from each client IP so every user

130
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:33,970
will will have a have a number of DNS

131
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:38,440
queries as they use internet over time

132
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:42,400
and then what we do we get each domain

133
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:45,370
name we convert it to some sort of a

134
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:49,709
binary vector specifically in our

135
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:51,880
approach we use Huffman coding for that

136
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:58,030
based on that we

137
00:08:51,880 --> 00:09:02,530
Fiji's so for every for every domain

138
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:06,360
name we build a vector and we feed these

139
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:10,959
vectors into our neural network to learn

140
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:15,160
the weights and to build a model by

141
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:19,870
maximizing the co-occurrence probability

142
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:22,120
of the neighborhood like what

143
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,580
what domains appear in the neighborhood

144
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:31,170
have a certain domain at at certain time

145
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:36,430
with some moving so called windows so

146
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:40,000
and at the end the output of our model

147
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:43,180
will be the vectors with hundreds of

148
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,660
dimensions for so for each domain name

149
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:51,689
we will have a vector of hundreds of

150
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:55,510
dimensions and each each dimension embed

151
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:59,110
a numerical value as a which is a

152
00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:06,069
floating point so what do we do with

153
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:09,580
this the correlations after we represent

154
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:12,670
every domain with a vector then we have

155
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,590
a we have a mathematical problem to

156
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,650
solve if you want to find the

157
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:20,400
correlation between two vectors just do

158
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:25,170
the dot product and there you have a

159
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:27,540
score that will give you how much

160
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:31,030
correlation exists between every two

161
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,490
domain names that we see so as I

162
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:37,209
mentioned earlier and I emphasize there

163
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:39,430
is no prior knowledge and what we do in

164
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:43,660
in correlation is not a strength

165
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:46,810
similarity and we don't need we don't

166
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:50,400
need or use any manual feature

167
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:54,939
engineering so now we have the first key

168
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:59,699
to unlock our threat intelligence which

169
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,700
is the correlations in the

170
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:08,820
in the second step we see that the

171
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:12,610
majority of the new threats come from

172
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:15,610
new domains that everyday appear in the

173
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:20,290
DNS traffic specifically core domains

174
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:22,360
how do we define core domains in in our

175
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:25,780
work with the final core domain or

176
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:30,040
domains as the second part to the to the

177
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:34,260
TLD of our fqdn

178
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:39,189
for example nominal calm or Akamai calm

179
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:42,730
so the second definition is what do we

180
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:46,570
define as a new core domain anything

181
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:49,300
that we see in our traffic that we

182
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,640
haven't seen before is called a new core

183
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:55,510
domain this this core domain is not

184
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:57,520
necessarily registered anywhere might be

185
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:02,430
registered or might not it might be just

186
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:07,439
like randomly generated from a DG a so

187
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:11,650
we build a system at nominal that

188
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:15,880
tracked these new core domains in real

189
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:19,630
time and as you can see on the right

190
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:24,450
side with unfortunately low resolution

191
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:28,689
resolution it is the dashboard that we

192
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:31,440
that we keep track of and it's just cool

193
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:37,080
visualization for the executives so

194
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:43,240
there we have it the second key for our

195
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:48,010
magic box so using the correlation

196
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:52,020
engine that we have we calculate we

197
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:56,380
calculate we build a numerical vector

198
00:12:52,020 --> 00:13:02,140
for every new core domain that we get in

199
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:05,740
real time in this step there was a quite

200
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:08,530
a bit of engineering challenge to be

201
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,620
able to capture these core domains in

202
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:12,699
real time because we have approximately

203
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,080
hundred billion

204
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:19,000
[Music]

205
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:21,070
we after filtering out 1.5 trillion we

206
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,290
have we still have one point we still

207
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:28,390
have hundred billion course pay per day

208
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:32,079
to go through it's quite a bit of it's a

209
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:36,850
large number to keep track on a on a

210
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:40,660
global base so and these these queries

211
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:43,090
comes from our our partners our partners

212
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,569
from multiple locations in the and the

213
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:49,110
globe so our solution is that we feed

214
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:52,960
this and we ingest all these through our

215
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:57,790
kakhovka data stream from all the our

216
00:13:52,960 --> 00:14:00,160
partner careers carriers and we use a

217
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:05,280
combination of open-source tools with

218
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:09,130
some in-house solutions to be able to

219
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:14,380
handle and keep track of every new

220
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:19,150
domain that appears in our traffic the

221
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:23,830
third part of our approach is is called

222
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:25,870
as clustering so we have the let's

223
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,480
assume we have there we can find the

224
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:35,170
correlated domains now what do we do

225
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:38,170
with it we now have for each for each

226
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:42,579
core domain we have a vector of

227
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:47,729
numerical a numerical vector that we can

228
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:50,880
use in in clustering we use we use a

229
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,800
spectral clustering with very few

230
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,810
threshold parameters the reason we use

231
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,630
in spectral clustering is that because

232
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:02,530
we experience and this method gives us

233
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:08,790
the the clusters with the most dense

234
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:13,530
density that that is appealing for us so

235
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,530
again for our executives we build a

236
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:27,220
fantasy visualization tool which I don't

237
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:30,960
know if I can show it here yeah so every

238
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:34,660
every new every core domain which is

239
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:40,000
which is a hundred of dimensions we

240
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:43,930
reduce it with TTT Snee to three

241
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,260
dimension and we use this visualization

242
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:50,050
tool to show the clusters that are

243
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:55,420
forming here so as you can see here we

244
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:59,589
have the necklace with here another one

245
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:01,630
it's a zero-day cluster with which it's

246
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:07,500
kind of unknown nobody has seen it

247
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:15,300
before is another one so this is the

248
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:34,360
part that we can see okay let's move on

249
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:36,760
here so our so as I said earlier we were

250
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,760
trying to scale up the thread

251
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:43,870
intelligence I'm going to I'm going to

252
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:47,560
show you a few use cases of that we we

253
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:49,990
were able to detect and and block with

254
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:54,760
with our approach and the next few

255
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:57,330
slides so we have sometimes we have only

256
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:02,460
fee and only a few domains that are

257
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:06,130
reported by by the third parties we can

258
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:09,010
we can add more coverage to that by

259
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,660
finding clusters that have high

260
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:17,819
correlation with these with those

261
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:23,230
domains we can detect a lot of DGA based

262
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:28,149
TGA based botnets and sometimes some

263
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:31,750
DJ's some new botanist comes with some

264
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:36,330
sort of variation of old DJ's which is

265
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:39,730
not yet reverse engineers so we would

266
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:41,559
there's there are cases that we detect

267
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,519
them but

268
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:48,039
there's no reverse engineers

269
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:51,129
reverse-engineered effort of that yet so

270
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:55,239
we block it before everyone everyone

271
00:17:51,129 --> 00:17:58,509
else could reverse-engineer it and and

272
00:17:55,239 --> 00:18:01,600
I'll show you an example of vilest

273
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:04,570
malware where there is no where there's

274
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:08,070
not even a binary code to reverse

275
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:15,700
engineer that so as I mentioned earlier

276
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:19,570
sometimes malicious ad campaigns are are

277
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:24,509
coming and we see a few of them reported

278
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:29,019
by our third parties we try to come and

279
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:32,440
match them with our with we we find

280
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:35,619
clusters that include them and when we

281
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:39,149
see clusters with good dense and density

282
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:42,279
that includes them we go ahead and with

283
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:46,928
with high confidence block the rest of

284
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:50,499
the correlated domains that we see so I

285
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:57,090
think everyone can see that all these

286
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:57,090
other members are look pretty malicious

287
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:07,649
the next example sometimes we know the

288
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:13,029
DGA an example is be dip and which is a

289
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:18,758
financial fraud but but it changes the

290
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:22,799
seeds like frequently so it's hard to

291
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:26,440
get the seeds and predict the C&C but

292
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:32,019
when we find clusters that include those

293
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:38,549
seeds it can it can it can be blocked

294
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:43,149
with high confidence as a as a bother

295
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:48,100
another example is violet that has too

296
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:49,649
many seats so pirate as you might know

297
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:54,480
has a

298
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:59,490
six as a like generates domains with the

299
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:03,450
length of six characters and it could

300
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:06,240
lead to very high collision with

301
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:09,409
legitimate domains as you can see there

302
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:15,809
I have an example of somebody reported

303
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:18,900
this domain D Don as as malicious which

304
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:24,539
is a false positive but it fits the

305
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:28,500
profile of this this VGA even a name

306
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:30,000
like Akamai calm fit this profile but

307
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:35,640
should we block him

308
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:40,289
no what we do is to find proper clusters

309
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:45,179
that allows us to block these with high

310
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:48,179
confidence so a domain like Akamai have

311
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:51,779
a very long history it's not a new core

312
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:56,820
it's not a new domain so we know that it

313
00:20:51,779 --> 00:21:00,690
shouldn't be blocked but as you can see

314
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:05,639
the rest of these domains that appeared

315
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:07,409
here are all new and they look pretty

316
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,649
malicious and they have the same

317
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:16,260
behavior as bought that so we blocked

318
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:18,500
them another example is SoCo box which

319
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:24,740
is a dictionary based DGA

320
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:28,740
so the so called vanilla SoCo box as

321
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:32,789
uses one English and one person names a

322
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:38,240
dictionary words to generate domains

323
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:44,250
with with with dotnet TLD but earlier in

324
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:48,510
2016 we detected a bunch of we detected

325
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:52,169
a new new trend with dot our new domains

326
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:56,510
which is a also a mix of dictionary at

327
00:21:52,169 --> 00:22:00,000
the time we did not find any

328
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:02,910
reverse-engineered DGA or known DGA for

329
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:11,070
that and then we blocked them

330
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:14,910
earlier in 2016 because because we

331
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:18,060
realized that these all these new core

332
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:22,380
domains have had the same behavior of

333
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:25,260
not being resolved into anything and it

334
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:32,610
looks like an old variant of existing

335
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:35,040
DGA later on the 360 that lab reverse

336
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:39,689
engineered that and published a result

337
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:44,389
in late 2016 so as you can see this in

338
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:48,240
it this is an example of capturing

339
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:52,380
capturing a DJ before it's been known

340
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:56,100
and protecting the customers

341
00:22:52,380 --> 00:23:04,140
another example is zero-day clusters

342
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:07,020
it's not a known DGA and again it it

343
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:11,220
showed the same behavior as the the

344
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:18,000
botnets and weeks after we detected this

345
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:21,000
this cluster and we blocked it security

346
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,300
companies announced it and named it as

347
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:33,420
as dork but so it's not a real DJ but

348
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:36,180
pre-generated cnc lists so ok I think I

349
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:45,600
have yeah this is the last example I

350
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:47,550
have which we find recently call it

351
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,360
guilty by association we found because

352
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:54,750
we found correlated malicious domains

353
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:57,300
that already exist being highly

354
00:23:54,750 --> 00:24:02,270
correlated with the new ones that we

355
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:06,030
found so this is found on July 18th 2017

356
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:08,100
we blocked it on the same Dame day

357
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:12,060
because we had high confidence that

358
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:15,270
these are malicious later on they were

359
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:23,309
confirmed as finalists malware

360
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:28,770
and in August 15 almost should be a

361
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:36,990
month a month later we have a blog post

362
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:41,730
about this this about this one so to

363
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:44,429
summarize our three key steps as I

364
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:47,010
mentioned earlier we have a the first

365
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:52,710
step we have our correlation engine that

366
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:56,280
is being built using the real-time DNS

367
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:59,970
data that we get from around the globe

368
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:02,580
we also keep track of all the new core

369
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:07,380
domains because of our high visibility

370
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:12,270
of the Internet traffic and the result

371
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:17,210
is clusters of malicious activities that

372
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:23,010
we can detect even before any other

373
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:26,580
company could could name them to

374
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:30,540
summarize we know that static and

375
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:33,360
dynamic analysis can provide a go threat

376
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,720
intelligence but unfortunately it's not

377
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,320
enough

378
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:42,030
this new threads are too dynamic to

379
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:47,580
stick to the traditional approaches to

380
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:53,450
fix them so we're proposing machine

381
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:59,280
intelligence to scale up and be able to

382
00:25:53,450 --> 00:26:02,970
detect these trends faster and block

383
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:07,950
them as I mentioned we have their three

384
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:11,240
key steps the correlation engine the new

385
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:15,059
core domain concept and clustering and

386
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:19,640
labeling which is the intelligence that

387
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:24,418
comes from the other members of the

388
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:28,200
security community that helps us that

389
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:33,880
helps us in our method so

390
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:35,740
at the end we realize that there are way

391
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:40,930
more machines out there in the world

392
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:41,860
that human security researchers so why

393
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,310
not lose them

394
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:53,479
thank you

395
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:53,480
[Applause]

396
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:10,990
thank you for the talk Amir are there

397
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:14,610
any questions go ahead gentlemen thank

398
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:18,730
you immune for the talk you hear me yes

399
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:21,129
if I get it correctly the input for for

400
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:23,590
your algorithm is at least of 30 feets

401
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,150
and the means that they already know

402
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:27,580
there are malicious this is the ground

403
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:30,700
truth you're using clusters in order to

404
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:32,560
find new malicious domains and what was

405
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,350
wondering about the coverage results if

406
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:38,080
do you know what's your unique

407
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:40,659
contribution like how many additional

408
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:46,540
malicious domain is the algorithm

409
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:49,210
capable of finding yes so as I said

410
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:56,050
earlier we have a very global visibility

411
00:27:49,210 --> 00:28:01,870
of the DNS traffic so security lists

412
00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:05,649
that are released are usually identify a

413
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:07,959
botnet or a threat late so one of the

414
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:10,750
main contributions is that we have a

415
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:13,750
real-time mechanism to detect these

416
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:19,720
threats and stop them before we even

417
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:22,780
know a name of a name of a malicious

418
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:28,360
botnet or cluster so that's that's one

419
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:31,060
of our main contributions was that the

420
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:34,330
first part of your question or does that

421
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:39,850
suffice is okay thanks

422
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:42,820
there is another question of death yeah

423
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:45,520
yeah I've got more of an operational

424
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:47,790
question could you speak louder yep

425
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,710
thank you my question is more personal

426
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:52,950
when you say you're blocking domains do

427
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:58,140
you mean that you

428
00:28:52,950 --> 00:29:00,060
nonexistent domain responses I I didn't

429
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,970
follow that sorry when you say you're

430
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:05,879
blocking domains yes that mean you're

431
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:08,430
answering your responding non-existent

432
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:14,600
domain don't we request you get yes so

433
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:20,490
our products that we sell to our to ISPs

434
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:23,639
we sell them mechanisms to block them

435
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:27,690
from to block the threats that we

436
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:31,530
identify from after after we identify

437
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:34,950
them we block them through the DNS cache

438
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:38,040
servers so that's that's where that's

439
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:45,210
where we stop the attacks was that the

440
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:48,960
so that means whether the the actor

441
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:52,530
changes DNS services you would still be

442
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:56,250
blocking yes so so the customers of that

443
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:58,860
I speak would not be infected

444
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:03,300
further on after we after we detect and

445
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:10,000
block them Thanks is there any other

446
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:13,569
question no so thank you Amir thank you

447
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,569
[Applause]
