00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,200
hello everyone I wish you say tomonaga

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,300
from jp's at our presentation today is

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,690
about how an attacker spreading

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,210
infections network and some tips that

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,830
may help such analyzing lateral movement

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,660
which we just publishing a report

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,859
recently so first of all let me

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,710
introduce ourselves

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,480
my name is Josie tominaga I have been

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,240
working at the episode under center for

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,730
five five years my primary

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,820
responsibilities are to analyze Mary and

13
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:40,199
EFI yard we have been publishing

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:45,899
analysis of the base of our doors we

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,440
also developed some tools we also some

16
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,920
tools

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:55,949
Richard is useful for Maria others is

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:58,559
they are available on github and my name

19
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,718
is Kate Camila and I came I work on the

20
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,539
internet internet initiative Japan or

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,729
iij for short and I'm an analyst at

22
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,200
security operation center and as a

23
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,298
member is a stock

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,810
I am primary walking on the unassisted

25
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,189
blocks sent from customers networks and

26
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:17,400
research and analysis of software

27
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:22,189
vulnerabilities and enhancement of ideas

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,189
of service and IV service infrastructure

29
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:29,750
so I get into main topics I would drug

30
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,020
talk about some issues in India fire

31
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,729
repetitions

32
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:38,699
first many host needs to be investigated

33
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:41,490
apt instant response and attacker that

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,670
has interesting internet work usually in

35
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:50,339
fact many other hosts and hosts and

36
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:53,700
server and infection within the network

37
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:57,899
for investigating such hosts we

38
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:02,520
obviously need roles however required

39
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:05,600
for invested not always record therefore

40
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,780
it is often difficult to detect or

41
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:13,019
investigate

42
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:16,350
lateral movement so in this presentation

43
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:19,830
I will introduce our approach to those

44
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:23,040
challenges through Genesis we have found

45
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:26,060
a limited set of tools are used in many

46
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:30,319
different instant for lateral movement

47
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:33,989
so if you know what will occur as

48
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:40,190
visitors investigative process will

49
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:43,680
dismiss this is test presentation topics

50
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:47,609
we will talk about overview of a

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,980
petition and lateral movement typical

52
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:55,110
tools used by attackers finally I will

53
00:02:51,980 --> 00:03:00,720
introduce some techniques for tracking

54
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:05,370
return movement first research of

55
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:08,880
lateral movement we examine eight tools

56
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:12,890
used by the talker for this research we

57
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:16,380
use the disk image of the C&C server and

58
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:22,609
decoded Mario connections when the

59
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:27,570
co-investigator disk image is apt apt 17

60
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:33,320
ultimate antique this campaigns targeted

61
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:36,269
at Japanese organizations this is

62
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:40,670
example of the list of the files in that

63
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:44,670
sheet Sabha that der Thomas was using

64
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:52,170
Mallya name is G status was managed by I

65
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:52,940
is and access database so another

66
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:57,540
example

67
00:03:52,940 --> 00:04:02,489
my name is MDB was managed by PHP and

68
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:10,769
SQL database executed commanded by the

69
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:13,920
attacker was saved in the database via

70
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:15,890
examinate the command executed by the

71
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:24,979
targa from the south

72
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:28,969
of total command executed 6866 as a

73
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:31,520
result of analyzing that corrected

74
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:36,230
command I found that the interesting

75
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:39,049
fact we found that 84% of the command

76
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,790
executed by the attacker as Windows

77
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,630
command

78
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:49,540
there are many control command for Mario

79
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:49,540
but record tend to use Windows command

80
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:56,450
attacker used not only attacked earth

81
00:04:53,450 --> 00:05:00,289
but also Windows command addressed men

82
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:04,969
led me to my do attack I use Windows

83
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:07,760
command under estimate tools because

84
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:15,460
they are not directed by antivirus

85
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:20,289
software next may be introduced to that

86
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,289
attack I used for lateral movement

87
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:31,250
destroyer introduced the flow of apt

88
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:34,450
instant attack of infected host with

89
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:38,390
Mario collecting information on the host

90
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:42,530
next the correct information of other

91
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:48,190
hosted server between the network and

92
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:48,190
deep spread the infection to other hosts

93
00:05:52,279 --> 00:06:04,999
they resent the confidential information

94
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:10,129
using cloud service and so last they did

95
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:14,149
drugs and created files matter movement

96
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:17,359
has four steps in the initial

97
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:24,619
investigation internal recons potato

98
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:27,979
infection and direct evidence after this

99
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:30,979
right i will describe what kind of tools

100
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:36,199
are used in the four steps of lateral

101
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:39,318
movement first step is initial

102
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:44,409
investigation the most used command is

103
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:47,719
task list even if the attacker is not

104
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:51,769
interesting in infected hosts over

105
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:59,629
realized Ambala in non-english in your

106
00:06:51,769 --> 00:07:02,749
sandbox never escape sir so this was

107
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:08,839
summarized Windows command executed by

108
00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:17,299
the taka daka use task list by is Baggio

109
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:20,989
IP config system info and so on second

110
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:26,448
step is internal Rico the most used

111
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:29,089
command is dir attacker the current the

112
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:32,719
confidential data stored in the infected

113
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:35,469
host for searching a network net command

114
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,469
is used

115
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:47,690
Terk infected investigated confidential

116
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:53,000
data using dir and the type command and

117
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:56,700
to such domain network NATO command also

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:02,250
being an echo command are also often

119
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:05,700
executed net command is a powerful tool

120
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:07,830
that many attackers net commander can

121
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:14,219
investigate various information of

122
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:17,880
domain network we found that attack I

123
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:24,090
use the commands such as Bing Edition

124
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:29,659
this stage why in commando is often

125
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:33,478
executed the reason for this is simple

126
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:38,820
they use ping command to such a local

127
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:41,849
network other example

128
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:46,640
another common command using by attacker

129
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:49,380
is a Col Michael command is executed

130
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:54,060
because they use the echo command to

131
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:57,000
create script files they are often

132
00:08:54,060 --> 00:09:04,380
created with echo command rather than

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:08,400
downloading of script files this is a

134
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:14,090
concentration of the details done per

135
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:20,760
year and all paths are not installed by

136
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:24,320
default Windows this common analyzed

137
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:28,800
event row we created by Microsoft

138
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:32,400
attacker Creed created correcting list

139
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:38,640
of users through logon using this

140
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:42,800
command son step is a spread of

141
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:45,980
infection the most used command is

142
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:52,519
eighty command attack I use eighty

143
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:56,509
common to create executed a command on

144
00:09:52,519 --> 00:10:01,100
the remote host eighty command is not

145
00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:06,920
supported on Windows 10 and Windows 8 if

146
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:12,769
at command cannot be used environment we

147
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:16,660
found that ACH tasks is used the hamachi

148
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:20,869
is a method of remote command execution

149
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:28,040
dock I use verbal copy and Reggie

150
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:33,290
command to mr. Maurya on the host as an

151
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:38,199
example of installing Maria by using MOF

152
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:42,860
comp common ethical register w my

153
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:49,790
command to depository so that a command

154
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:52,939
can be executed periodically first step

155
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:56,990
is direct evidence the most used command

156
00:10:52,939 --> 00:11:01,549
is the read command in a few case they

157
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:08,230
use wget util to direct the the event

158
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:12,350
roles they also use dairy Pascal

159
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:18,709
caressed and TT w everything you tell

160
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:21,730
command also to Delta event roles the

161
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:26,299
variability user accounts at them

162
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:34,689
this example is such a good logo able to

163
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:38,919
ID other example of the dairy turbulence

164
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:40,040
they remove the ticket or pasta ticket

165
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:43,489
dysentery

166
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:47,089
pasta hajj is not used for malicious

167
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:49,879
program they tend to use pasta ticket

168
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:52,389
such as golden ticket and silver ticket

169
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:52,389
instant

170
00:11:54,260 --> 00:12:05,370
Tucker can Delta G is ticket by using

171
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:08,730
carries to command so this is an example

172
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:18,390
of the latter move into steps executed

173
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:21,230
by t cutter cut first the first initial

174
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:27,540
investigation is full my command

175
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:35,700
then the news miracle to create golden

176
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:43,079
ticket internal recon use ping on dir

177
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:49,640
command so they executed files to remote

178
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:49,640
host with copy and eighty common finally

179
00:12:54,529 --> 00:13:00,560
okay from this point I'm going to talk

180
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:04,890
about how the attacks can be traced and

181
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:07,290
in terms of tracing attacks by default

182
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:09,990
on Windows some rocks are taking the

183
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:13,529
window screen rocks for example if it's

184
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:16,770
an client OS and rocks on the successful

185
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:18,140
and failed Robbins successful rogoff's

186
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:21,079
and successful policing with

187
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:24,540
modifications are recorded and he since

188
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:27,029
averaging successful authentication is

189
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:30,569
also recorded but that's pretty much

190
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:33,120
about it and we can we can see some of

191
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,760
the robot histories from the default

192
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,100
windows rocks but they may not be enough

193
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,319
record for proving other activities such

194
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,050
as execution history and access

195
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:48,630
histories and we think that's a problem

196
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:51,569
so what we did is we've unearthed them

197
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:54,060
so we've taken 49 different tools that

198
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:57,360
were frequently used in at at behaviors

199
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,579
and we've actually run them on the

200
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,010
bottom networks and see what works that

201
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:04,620
can be corrected and these four out of

202
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:06,350
these 49 tools about one third of them

203
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,410
were estimate windows to

204
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:11,600
so that indicates that these tools will

205
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:16,189
not be ejected by anti-malware software

206
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:20,300
and from our research we've concluded

207
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:22,520
that in most cases we need to do some

208
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:28,209
additional tweaks to obtain enough

209
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:30,949
records for tracing the tools and the

210
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:33,800
research is published on GT on the J

211
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:36,860
Passat CC website and studied in

212
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:40,729
Japanese and ethos in English and we

213
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:43,550
first published this on June 2017 this

214
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:46,000
year and we've updated this on this

215
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:51,109
Tuesday and it's on the website

216
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,240
so what's published here is we have the

217
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,580
tools listed on the left side of the

218
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:59,150
page and on the right side of the page

219
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:02,990
it we put put up with corrected the

220
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:04,880
rocks that rocks of the produced from

221
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:09,130
the rocks that are produced from the

222
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:13,130
tools and what rocks on the documents

223
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:15,850
the windows vent rocks and that for post

224
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:18,740
default and additional rocks and

225
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:21,830
registry and cache for performance

226
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:24,320
improvements and file system activities

227
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:27,680
and firing folder access history is a

228
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,920
network traffic and amongst those

229
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,380
elements we've came up that the event

230
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:36,020
ropes was most useful among the entities

231
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,360
and when I say about event rocks in this

232
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:41,410
presentation I'm talking about audit

233
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,690
policy and system and application logs

234
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:47,839
but there are also some other useful

235
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:49,640
information such as Houston journals and

236
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:53,900
packet captures and I will talk about

237
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:57,800
these also in this presentation so from

238
00:15:53,900 --> 00:16:00,230
this point I will talk about systems

239
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,810
analysis tools used what occurs in see

240
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,490
what see what we've done to publish the

241
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:08,209
report and what can be found out from

242
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:12,560
the rocks and the example I'm gonna pick

243
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:15,290
up here is the PS exit and probably most

244
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,000
of you know what PS exit is but it's

245
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,910
enriched with two and my photo

246
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,850
Microsoft's internals and what it does

247
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:26,360
is it executes a specified program on

248
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:29,510
remote host and it is referred to but it

249
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,240
is sometimes used in various ways so we

250
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:35,990
pick up this as an example

251
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,850
so if PS x'q was executed and see what

252
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:40,190
can be found it on the default windows

253
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,440
and before getting into details I gotta

254
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:45,650
talk about the terminology when I say

255
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,930
target first here target host is the

256
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:50,630
recipe as a remote command was executed

257
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:53,359
and when I say about the source host

258
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:58,430
that's about where the PS exit command

259
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:01,610
was executed and in terms of the ropes

260
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:04,490
recorded on default windows the target

261
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:08,089
host the installation and execution and

262
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:10,940
termination of the PS exe SVC which is a

263
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:13,339
service for hunting the PS xxxx on the

264
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:16,490
target host remains in record and I

265
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:19,250
showed an example in the next page and

266
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,920
so on the source host there are some

267
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:24,980
ropes that remains for example if

268
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,690
prefetch is enabling the host the

269
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,370
prefetch file remains in the prefetch

270
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:31,190
folder and is under the windows

271
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:33,800
directory but if it's a Windows server

272
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:36,080
or the Windows programs under certain

273
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,659
conditions such as virtual machines the

274
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,409
improve fetch is disabled by default so

275
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:45,200
it doesn't help and another example is

276
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:47,570
if PS exec was used on the source node

277
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,460
for the first time it pops up and

278
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,560
writing this agreement message and and

279
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,380
asks you do you accept the license

280
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,030
agreement and if you say yes then

281
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,400
registry would be modified and say

282
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:02,180
you've agreed to the license agreement

283
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:05,180
but again if PS exact was used before

284
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,770
the attack saying this tree would would

285
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:10,280
not be modified so it doesn't help you

286
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:14,500
either okay

287
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:17,990
and this is an example of the 3s exe SPC

288
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:21,230
executed executed on the target host and

289
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:23,950
it's from this role you can say the PS

290
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:26,270
exe SVC service enters the running state

291
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:30,110
but it doesn't really tell what

292
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:32,480
specifically happened so we need to do

293
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,309
we need field

294
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,620
and see what has happened we need to

295
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:40,129
know more about instant to figure out

296
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:43,610
what has happened within the duck so

297
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:47,570
what we do is we start start off with

298
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:50,000
the process auditing so it's on Windows

299
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,740
by default and enabling the audit

300
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,100
records it gives more details about

301
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:58,820
programming executions and if I enable

302
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:01,250
the audit process audits and take the

303
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,899
rocks on the windows and just Windows

304
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:07,610
Event roxton event forty sixty eighty

305
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:11,510
eight but you can see under on the right

306
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:14,449
hand of the screen is it says PS exe SVC

307
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:19,520
dot exe was execute it and they talked a

308
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:22,070
vision type was type one okay and the

309
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,830
other thing you can find out is see

310
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:27,559
Emily that exe is an command prompt but

311
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:33,500
execute it and its parent process was

312
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:36,230
the PS exe SVC okay but you know it says

313
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,919
come on prompt was execute it but that's

314
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,480
about it

315
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,240
and still not sure about what has

316
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,860
happened so we we need more some minutes

317
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:47,990
more information about what has happened

318
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,469
so we need to know about the common

319
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,830
rinds

320
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:55,130
now there are two options for recording

321
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:56,960
command runs on Windows and one is the

322
00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:00,049
install system on from system from

323
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,360
sysinternals and other is the enable

324
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:05,840
common run process auditing and many

325
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:09,260
other ways for doing this and in our

326
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,809
research we came up the system but it

327
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,490
will be helpful and I think pretty much

328
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:14,720
everyone know about what Susumu is

329
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:17,990
because it wasn't writing it off

330
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,570
yesterday and it keeps the track of exe

331
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:21,950
file hashes and it can be used for

332
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:24,740
obtaining other artifacts which

333
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,320
generally describe radio and it can be

334
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,570
installed on both the server and client

335
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:33,110
windows so we came up the system would

336
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:35,210
be more helpful so it's about the

337
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:38,418
process auditing and the next comes to

338
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:40,880
the registry and register events can be

339
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:44,960
recorded on post audit and system works

340
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,250
also and from our research we came up to

341
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,890
the audit rocks and

342
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:51,530
system impose gifts and suppose gives

343
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:54,140
the sufficient information for Irving

344
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:57,710
what has happened and well one thing

345
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,990
that's important is equal in both audits

346
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:02,540
and system own it requires to configure

347
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:06,970
it for configuration for working the

348
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:09,350
means necessary and for the fire audits

349
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:11,810
exist in the fire shares and access to

350
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:14,719
the file systems can be tracked by using

351
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:17,570
the audit drugs and if we are just

352
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,690
talking about the file creation then it

353
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:22,970
can be rocked with system on - and we

354
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:27,680
think - with system on rocks is easier

355
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:29,270
to read for humans but for following the

356
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,260
file creation system all you need to do

357
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,410
make you need to devise new

358
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:35,330
configurations and it doesn't track the

359
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:40,310
fire modification and duration at a

360
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:42,080
restart button we've tested and another

361
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:44,540
example that can be rocked with post

362
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,600
system and audits is a network

363
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,730
connection and again both have similar

364
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,689
contents but the system is easier to

365
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:57,830
read so I've talked about audit rocks

366
00:21:53,690 --> 00:22:00,050
and system works and should we use which

367
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,840
one should we use well actually use both

368
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:04,760
of them and they'll post pause and cones

369
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,929
for using the oldest rocks and system on

370
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:11,140
rocks and the pros for using audits is

371
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:14,000
it's available in Windows by default and

372
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:16,010
some information are optimum audit rocks

373
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,940
only certain pros for using the audit

374
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:22,160
rocks but cons for using audit logs but

375
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,780
these some rocks are confusing and you

376
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,750
have to be familiar with the ideas of

377
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:29,000
the handles and the bindings in some of

378
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:31,010
the rocks and sometimes the confusing

379
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,210
food especially huge things the rocks

380
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:38,629
was very first time and another cons for

381
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:41,840
using the audit rocks is has few details

382
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,620
on system or in some cases and so forth

383
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:48,169
so comes foreclose on sis phone it's

384
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:50,149
it's easier to reread agree and it has

385
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:53,090
some more details such as fire hashes

386
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:55,929
and come on whines but for cones for

387
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:59,320
using see small is you need to install

388
00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:01,330
install software and

389
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,340
times unit make additional configuration

390
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:07,230
and you need make an XML file for to

391
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:10,959
English and just such sounds complicated

392
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:14,470
okay now I've talked about even rooks

393
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,350
and there are some others we wish I'm

394
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:19,300
going to show you a few and when see us

395
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:22,919
in journals and buying the packet

396
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:25,409
captures so for the use and journals

397
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:29,170
assuming we are talking about Windows

398
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:32,050
you using NTFS file system and when

399
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:34,270
files are created on only NTFS file

400
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:38,260
system the new engine will be recorded

401
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:40,360
so it says file create and filed extend

402
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:43,450
and fibrillations also recorded on the

403
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,879
using journals so all the rocks can be

404
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:48,490
useful for tracking creation duration

405
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,230
but also using journal could using

406
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:55,510
journal could be hopeful for tracking

407
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:57,970
the file creation division and another

408
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:01,270
thing I pick up here is a packet

409
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:04,980
captures and PS xxxx uses assembly to

410
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:07,330
and which many Windows programs do and

411
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:10,930
it can be tracked from the package

412
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:13,419
captures so if you see the packet

413
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:17,080
capture and PS eggs egg it says create

414
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:19,720
request file v6 c sv c dot exe that

415
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,939
means to copy the PSI x c sv c dot exe

416
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,660
to the rim to the target host from the

417
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:29,080
source host and another thing that point

418
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:32,500
of all is create request file SVC CTL

419
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:36,850
such to bring up the PS exe SVC service

420
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:39,490
on the target host and one other thing

421
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:41,949
you can find out from here is you can

422
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:45,850
change the file name the PSX ik dot exe

423
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:47,710
on the on the source host but even if

424
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:51,310
the name was modified that this the

425
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:53,950
filename copied here psix ESPC that exe

426
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:55,389
dran this it remains this way so that's

427
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:59,620
one thing you can figure out from the

428
00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:02,020
target captures and another thing you

429
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:07,389
can find out is if you are running the

430
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:10,810
PS eclectic and and the STD in STD out

431
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:12,760
and STD errors such they come on that's

432
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:17,440
the result of foreign in the coma

433
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:19,629
so it's also request VSS env2 and this

434
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,600
isn't just an example in this PS exact

435
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:26,380
in this case but if the program uses

436
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:28,060
smb2 then it often oftentimes the

437
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:33,040
operations can be monitored with the

438
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:35,409
packet captures so up to here I've

439
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:40,139
talked about windows event rocks and use

440
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:43,510
some journals and packet captures so

441
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:45,730
while we twist from the rocks well it

442
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:48,370
keeps the details of attacks that Kim

443
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:49,840
and the details of attacks could be

444
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:53,560
Illustrated from the rocks

445
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,600
so if Natak created temporary files on

446
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,760
registry values and been removed in

447
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,760
saying if you can start to figure out

448
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,820
the contents for doing the forensics if

449
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,850
you know what files were created then

450
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:09,090
you might have an idea knowing about

451
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:12,580
what has happened during the attack and

452
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:15,699
another example another thing is if the

453
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:17,590
command rang is not recorded at all it

454
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,050
becomes hard to figure out what was

455
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:23,649
doing during the attack so the Rope

456
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:28,090
would be useful but there are also some

457
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:31,540
challenges today's cause well fast rocks

458
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:33,520
sometimes may not be enough and you may

459
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:35,560
need to know have additional rocks for

460
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,690
obtaining more details and those

461
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:40,120
examples include the operation rocks of

462
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:43,780
current computers and network activity

463
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:46,899
rocks and etc the second point in

464
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:50,020
challenges is it is necessary to tune up

465
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:53,260
rocks sizes appropriately because the

466
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:55,420
default size for Windows is 20 megabytes

467
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:58,350
and the ravine rocks and author ox might

468
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:02,320
get overwritten one stated to rush so in

469
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:04,570
tune up the rocks appropriately and the

470
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,730
sad thing is the rocks could be purged

471
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:08,980
during the duck and the first part of

472
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:12,400
the presentation we came up with double

473
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:14,890
EVT you tell that can delete the windows

474
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,860
paint rocks so it may be necessary to

475
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:20,560
keep dry rocks the safe location reusing

476
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:24,040
protocols such as Isis sea stroke or the

477
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:26,039
event subscriptions Windows servers so

478
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:30,219
those are challenges for

479
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:31,839
and to conclude the talks we keep the

480
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:34,629
points we are at point out here are

481
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:36,729
three points one is typically limited

482
00:27:34,629 --> 00:27:40,570
set of tools and commands used for other

483
00:27:36,729 --> 00:27:42,669
movements and too many attack tools can

484
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:45,399
be detected with audit policy and Cisco

485
00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:47,469
and Russ tree our report would be

486
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:50,529
helpful if you're investigating abt

487
00:27:47,469 --> 00:27:53,219
incidents and that's it from us and

488
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:53,219
thank you for listening

489
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:11,320
thank you thanks a lot for a great talk

490
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:12,920
any questions no okay thanks a lot thank

491
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,069
you

492
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,069
[Applause]
