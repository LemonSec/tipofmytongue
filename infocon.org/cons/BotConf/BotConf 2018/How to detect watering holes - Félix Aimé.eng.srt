[Music]

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:32,790
so good morning everyone my talk today

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,699
will this with a personal project named

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,910
Nightcrawler and main came to this

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,910
project was to find what in whole on the

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,559
Internet

13
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:47,510
just to present one slide to present

14
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:51,149
myself I'm like technical IT security

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:55,440
geek and I love also geopolitics some

16
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:57,840
design and today I work in Kaspersky as

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,620
a sweat intelligence researcher from the

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,769
great team and previously I worked for

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,170
the French cyber defense agency and

20
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:09,929
British may come as a pen tester and

21
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:14,369
this is the first time that I I disclose

22
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:17,450
one of my personal project so night

23
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:20,220
color it's a project that I've started I

24
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:23,960
don't remember exactly when because

25
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:28,650
there were many proof-of-concept but

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:32,490
maybe in 2016 just get my own straight

27
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:35,850
Intel just don't really on cubic reports

28
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:41,780
and discover something by myself from my

29
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:44,669
bedroom it was great and it was mainly

30
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:50,070
dedicated to find something related to a

31
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:54,630
PT's but obviously I found many stuff

32
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:57,508
regarding cyber criminality and many

33
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:01,530
expert kids and most of them I don't

34
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:03,210
discuss them in open source because ok I

35
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,350
have time to discover them it's

36
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:10,729
automatic ok but in order to do some an

37
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:13,769
investigation it's more complicated so

38
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:18,929
for those who don't know what

39
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:20,760
whore it's it's unlike for civic

40
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,030
criminal that they will just install

41
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:28,170
their on many websites watering

42
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:31,860
hole are the insertion of specific

43
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:35,970
malicious scripts on a specific website

44
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:38,970
in order to to infect the visitors so

45
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:42,030
for example if you are if you want to

46
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,790
target some government you will put some

47
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:48,720
I don't know what expert kit on an

48
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:52,280
impassive website for example or there

49
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:56,190
is also some geographic watering hole if

50
00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:00,390
you have a company with employee in a in

51
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:06,470
a certain city they just do what hang

52
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:11,100
hold on like some city releases website

53
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:15,180
so we have different type of whatting

54
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:17,600
hole the first one is a so so hold the

55
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,250
watering hole type but still active so

56
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:24,630
the malicious guy just simply months

57
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:27,660
some JavaScript or iframe on the on the

58
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:30,269
website and it's okay it works and it

59
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,750
redirects the visitors to the malicious

60
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:37,440
server after that you have a different

61
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,840
form of watering hole where it's not the

62
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,510
HTML body of the web page that is

63
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,170
tempered but a legitimate scrip for

64
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:50,720
example jQuery and they just happened

65
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:53,399
some malicious script instead this

66
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,290
legitimate script in order to redirect a

67
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,420
visitor and after you have more

68
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,750
complicated stuff like malvert rising

69
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:05,910
with lot of row directions that slid to

70
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:10,590
the malicious server today nowadays the

71
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:14,030
second one i think is most used but we

72
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:18,120
can find more creative ways to redirect

73
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:22,079
but this is the the three main freemen

74
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:26,310
type of watering holes today and on the

75
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,210
manage the server when you have like for

76
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,139
a

77
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:33,750
or targeted attack you have some

78
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:37,139
possible IP range white whitelisting so

79
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:42,690
for example if the guys target

80
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:44,849
government he will search for their what

81
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:50,940
future use the government in order to

82
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:54,840
whitelist their IP you have also browser

83
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:57,330
FICA and fingerprinting on plugging

84
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,929
local IP except language etcetera

85
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:03,419
etcetera

86
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:07,289
and today's there is no more very like

87
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:09,840
old days but most of the attackers and

88
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:13,199
even state that occurs just early on

89
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,960
like social engineering with fake

90
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:20,849
installers or pros of providing plugins

91
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:26,430
as Chola for example so how to detect

92
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:28,889
watering hole the fact is the in the IT

93
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:31,860
security community ok it's good to

94
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:36,090
reverse something but some context is

95
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:40,139
also good to know your enemy so here is

96
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:42,690
what I follow today so we have some

97
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,300
regions of the world with crisis for

98
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:48,150
example the Ukraine crisis you have the

99
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:53,219
media list with Sanya Kurdistan Iraq

100
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:58,739
Iran Yemeni arabiya Saudia and after you

101
00:05:53,219 --> 00:06:00,900
have the China with all of their all of

102
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,199
its tensions with like the widow

103
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:07,198
community with the soft shine a seat i

104
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:10,620
won Tibet etc and you have the North

105
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:14,580
Korea which is interesting also its that

106
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:17,699
ok I focus on this region but I focus

107
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:21,120
also on all the this type of target I

108
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:25,830
think that I haven't put all the sectors

109
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:29,009
but most of the ITT Street actors for

110
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:31,770
economical region will target like for

111
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:34,380
private sectors will target some future

112
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:37,609
technologies so when you able energies

113
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:41,070
or nuclear or etcetera etcetera

114
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:45,690
I follow was also some

115
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:47,820
all what old wordpress some porn and

116
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:51,060
streaming websites because they can lead

117
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,710
to weeks but get up so and online stores

118
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:57,720
and you will see why

119
00:06:52,710 --> 00:07:00,750
just after so how to get the website you

120
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,210
have different different form the first

121
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:07,500
one the first ID is okay you just really

122
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:09,570
and passive dns I'm searching all I

123
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,000
don't know what government website I

124
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,800
will just ask some passive DNS and get

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,400
the domains in paninis directory

126
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,710
scrapping are good because it's each

127
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,109
countries are its own defense company

128
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,799
associations

129
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:28,290
you can also Leon like linked dabei

130
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,920
databases for example if you want to

131
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:35,460
target some Intel company it's ok to use

132
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:38,160
a lighter Stratfor database and you have

133
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:44,010
obviously manual insertion and I'm

134
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:46,410
pretty good to that also so how to

135
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:48,240
detect something that you don't know you

136
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:51,330
don't know you don't have any rule and

137
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:56,370
that's just focusing on heuristic many

138
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:59,070
many many guys just think ok eristic are

139
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:01,560
bad or it's very complicated to detect

140
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:05,159
whatever hole when you don't know who is

141
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,820
targeted and by what in fact you just

142
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,860
have to monitor some changes how it's

143
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:15,420
the first time that I see that host yeah

144
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:19,710
and this all seems to be IP address and

145
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:22,530
it doesn't rely on some domain name you

146
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:25,710
can have also some Arista can like for

147
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:29,820
you is that the host was created few

148
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:33,059
weeks ago or ensberg just the host use

149
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:36,360
free SSL Certificates or you have some

150
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:40,140
mixed HTTP contents during the users

151
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:44,580
browsing and of course there is lot of

152
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:47,490
noise so it's it shows that I consider

153
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,530
as legitimate I just what whitelist it

154
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:53,430
but I don't block it it's not like

155
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:54,870
adblock so I can follow the chain to for

156
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,270
example my left I see

157
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:03,120
it's it's okay and I've detected some

158
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:06,620
some complaints with that if you are

159
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:10,980
also look if you are looking also for

160
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:12,810
for some suspicious things just what you

161
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:17,310
can do is AHA everything

162
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:21,150
each suspicious host is suspicious

163
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:23,040
script just put some signature on it so

164
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:26,730
I have some example of signature that I

165
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:30,089
I have I am like one and read and I

166
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:32,130
don't know how many signatures so the

167
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,310
first one for example it was the

168
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:39,240
obfuscated scan works feels quite good

169
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:42,930
to detect Chinese guys Chinese to detect

170
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,900
some interest and set you have also a

171
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:49,140
rule so I put roofs on everything so

172
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:51,480
HTTP response body contains who is

173
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,510
records SSL Certificates are okay add

174
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:58,590
two paths and obviously lost because

175
00:09:54,510 --> 00:10:01,620
some some articles just registered their

176
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:03,380
domain names with the same pattern so

177
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,230
you can do some really excellent hosts

178
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:13,140
so for ASEAN octopus which is the second

179
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:16,170
cluster of ASEAN notice apt so like they

180
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:20,520
had a specific cookie values or I just

181
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:24,120
do some rules on that and also I some

182
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:27,270
guys that just have some exploits they

183
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,240
put just rub comments on them on the

184
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:32,850
expats so if some stack devotes stuff

185
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,060
like that it's okay to to put to put

186
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:40,490
rules and for for some reason you can

187
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:44,760
best like tour or days or it's okay to

188
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:48,210
so hired to put botnet on my conf sore

189
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,580
how to detect watering holes you have to

190
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,590
create your own botnet because you are

191
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:56,250
dealing with thousands and of websites

192
00:10:52,590 --> 00:11:01,620
so it's a it's quite expensive but it's

193
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:03,630
ok so this is my own botnet so you have

194
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:07,520
like two master server with a queue that

195
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:10,520
have lot of target and tasks and this

196
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:13,689
we just asked some colors and the colors

197
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:18,020
will hold the web's

198
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:21,590
so whoo I don't know if yeah you will

199
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:23,810
see something so I have some mob sake

200
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,320
for example run don't target selections

201
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,800
for you

202
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:31,970
like if I'm targeted our governments

203
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:35,329
I just put Iran demise my target so you

204
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:39,350
don't have a like a list of either what

205
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:42,050
governments with websites hire some

206
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:45,590
corals development on the fly and today

207
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:49,630
I really on like 40 years origins 20

208
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:53,630
except language which are linked to the

209
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:58,250
domains TLD I follow also local links

210
00:11:53,630 --> 00:12:01,280
and the websites and I call also some

211
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:03,920
johan riebmann which is in grey like

212
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:07,430
human interaction traumatized and the

213
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,860
turns we are still developing it in

214
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:12,290
order for example if you I think that

215
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:15,350
like cyber criminal we've do that

216
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:18,980
against its type of project so for

217
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:21,740
example just the payload will be

218
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:24,500
activated when the user will scroll the

219
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:31,070
page or stuff like that so it's it's

220
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:34,790
still in development so some example so

221
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:37,940
sorry I had a demo for you of my terms

222
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:42,110
if you are interested I will just show

223
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:46,160
you with my own computers but today I

224
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:49,790
will not present the demo on this disk

225
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:54,610
reference so I have my own computer I

226
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:57,790
don't know just here to show you that so

227
00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:02,570
some credit crowd still our campaign

228
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:04,969
things that nobody I I haven't seen

229
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:08,000
something related to that in open source

230
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:10,550
for example you have a website that

231
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,810
brought himself to I would like 1

232
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:17,479
million order it's log edge websites and

233
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:20,420
if you go to check out something you

234
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:26,510
just will see there

235
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:29,589
is something bad in it here you have

236
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:34,790
some relation to GS cloud.com

237
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:38,570
with JavaScript static da GS and if you

238
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:42,709
go on this JavaScript I will see some

239
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:45,589
 and obviously when when you put

240
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:49,189
your credit cards it will just send the

241
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:52,550
credit card to the malicious server so I

242
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:54,860
have some example so I've put some

243
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:58,430
credit card information and sent to the

244
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:00,320
server the fact is that it's not it's a

245
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:03,410
good way to steal credit card and many

246
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:09,470
informations and the fact is not only

247
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:13,639
this website that it's infected yeah so

248
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:16,160
it's a multi go and well I've cross

249
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:20,360
arise on some stuff and you have like

250
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:24,740
nine hundreds website that are today

251
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:27,589
targeted by these two campaigns and it's

252
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:30,110
not like a small website I have a like

253
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:33,050
big US brand or stuff like that out

254
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:36,800
there targeted since many and many

255
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:40,160
months I don't know if they're to

256
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,310
cluster are from the same guy I don't

257
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:48,579
think so but I think that they they know

258
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:53,569
each other's I've seen also a mini stuff

259
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:56,989
like exploit kids mainly in 2016 thanks

260
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:59,209
to Adobe and all the security industry

261
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,459
that I've done a great work in order to

262
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:03,699
prevent some of Brazil really the

263
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:06,290
expectations checks the post comes

264
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:08,060
malicious Pond Road erection on some

265
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:11,180
like for example some on Bessie website

266
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:15,279
it's quite funny cryptocurrency meaning

267
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:19,849
on the OVA website on many websites and

268
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:22,490
some unattributed stuff I saw are guys

269
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:25,220
that pre-positioned themself on many

270
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:32,930
website but I don't know what will be

271
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:34,370
the final payload so I I best also

272
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:38,120
targeted attack which

273
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:42,589
which was the the main aim of this

274
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:45,170
project so I will disclose just one and

275
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:46,699
after I will show you all the injuries

276
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:52,040
and said that I've seen with this

277
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:54,170
project so it's an X and M two watering

278
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:59,059
hole I don't remember the real name of

279
00:15:54,170 --> 00:16:03,378
this intrusion set in open source and

280
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:06,100
I've seen them in a soft Korea defense

281
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,100
website

282
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:12,620
months and months ago and I thought that

283
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:18,279
the website have seen it because it just

284
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:21,889
go offline and but no so if you look at

285
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:25,879
what are what is requested you will see

286
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:29,089
that you have some get Flash Player okay

287
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:32,360
they use like as do believe VF object or

288
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:34,100
yeah dodge yes which just will direct

289
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,759
you to flash player when you don't have

290
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:41,660
flash player and you you see that I

291
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:44,389
disclose all the thing I don't care and

292
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:48,759
you will see that yes you are related to

293
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:54,019
a server a server that has a bad OPSEC

294
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:56,420
because you you have all the like access

295
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:59,089
log it's not the Apache access log it's

296
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,949
their own access log and obviously you

297
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:04,880
can access also to the whitelist and

298
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:10,629
know who are the entities which are the

299
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:14,569
the target identities okay so it's a

300
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:17,089
it's a server with what whitelisting can

301
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:21,319
I get the payload yeah I can get the

302
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:25,369
payload it's I haven't act anything it

303
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:28,908
just get requests so yes I will download

304
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:32,600
the payload and the payload yes our big

305
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:36,559
6mm to implants which is interesting is

306
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:39,559
that I've done some some a roar in there

307
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:43,539
you saw a chance regarding like it's a

308
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:47,720
space p2 and they are like Windows

309
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:50,360
Windows Vista related use origins

310
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:56,419
dis you sergeants normally doesn't exist

311
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:58,340
on a Microsoft Network after that there

312
00:17:56,419 --> 00:18:03,500
are all the campaign's that I've seen

313
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:05,720
this year so the taller guys the two

314
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,260
cluster of audiologists

315
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,179
I don't know if they are the same guys

316
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:16,100
ASEAN notice is known to target like

317
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:17,960
human right defenders in Vietnam but you

318
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,209
have Aussie on octopus which is another

319
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,460
clusters they have some they have act

320
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:25,520
and you have an overlap between watering

321
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:30,980
holes of these two clusters but the

322
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:33,168
second one just Ark governmental mainly

323
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,390
government and stuff and some some

324
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:37,190
companies which is interesting with

325
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:40,340
ASEAN doctor pieces that they have done

326
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:43,760
watering hold also on auto prove a what

327
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:47,418
a fluke web access pages of some

328
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:53,240
companies you have news beef like okay

329
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:56,140

Iranian group you have emissary panda

331
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:01,730
some on different governmental targets

332
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:04,639
you have also Greenberg not known in

333
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:09,980
open source to to do some watering horse

334
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:13,010
copy kittens bad rabbit and different

335
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:15,679
compounds that are not disclosed in open

336
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:18,919
source and I'm still and this degree and

337
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:25,750
this digging in it to know who is behind

338
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:30,020
or was the real intrusion set beyond so

339
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:34,010
regarding future works it's a big

340
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:36,110
project for one man today I have a good

341
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:39,470
friend that helped me a lot regarding

342
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:44,840
development if you if there is any

343
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:47,480
volunteers to join me just ask i will

344
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,990
also implement new ballistics as modules

345
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,299
in the master server today is not very

346
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:57,140
it so you just have to to had some Kurt

347
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:59,240
and it's not very reliable and maybe I

348
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,010
don't know sharing with the community

349
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,860
but in risk

350
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:06,800
it's tough because of the bad guys I

351
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:09,770
don't know today the question is still

352
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:19,550
open and so if you have any question

353
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:25,450
feel free to ask thank you thank you for

354
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:29,030
X for this talk we have I'm French so we

355
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:47,660
have time for one or two questions

356
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:49,700
I mean you up there hi thanks a lot for

357
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,680
sharing the good work I actually have

358
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,120
some kind of similar project so I was

359
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:58,750
wondering if you were actually looking

360
00:20:53,120 --> 00:21:00,949
at data regarding JavaScript variable

361
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,960
because I figure out that sometimes

362
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:06,440
looking at the size of the variable or

363
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:10,220
of the entropy you can detect kind of

364
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,230
obfuscated JavaScript code and then it

365
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:17,440
helps sometimes detect what showing all

366
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:20,710
as well yeah the fact that many truckers

367
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:26,150
advertisement and legitimate stuff use

368
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:29,570
packet JavaScript and what I don't

369
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:31,970
sandbox anything so I just execute this

370
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:35,030
JavaScript see if there is some relation

371
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:37,760
but I don't have some entropy rules on

372
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:41,120
the JavaScript I thought to do that and

373
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,370
just seeing the the real positive or the

374
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,090
false positive it was okay well I will

375
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,209
stop with

376
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:49,580
entropies step but that's it I think

377
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:52,160
it's a good way with some Packers like

378
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:57,320
you have meta spot Packers or Packers

379
00:21:52,160 --> 00:22:01,040
that are know to be just bad Packers I

380
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:07,360
have them in in my yahood so it's quite

381
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:07,360
ok but no I'm I don't really own entropy

382
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:15,410
is there any other question one is here

383
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:24,120
no one here

384
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:27,419
run faster wait a second ok thank you

385
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:32,989
thank you for the talk in your opinion

386
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:36,120
in how many cases okay sorry sorry

387
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:38,700
in how many kisses do you think this is

388
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,918
really what angle in the sense that they

389
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,470
are looking for someone specifically and

390
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:45,929
send the malicious code only to the

391
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:50,880
subset of people based on IP ranges beta

392
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:55,770
whatever compared to targeting everyone

393
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:59,909
that connects to the website if you

394
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:01,950
don't force a stipple on only the common

395
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:08,539
post on the cast were telling our source

396
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:12,659
window charge managers can subset do

397
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:15,539
okay really thing like watering holes

398
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:20,640
like with websites and specific watering

399
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:22,500
holes I saw that and in this list who is

400
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,549
using your whitelist so you have to lie

401
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,150
you have ASEAN Lotus News beef I don't

402
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:30,090
think so

403
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:32,070
ma cherie panda - they use whitelist

404
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:34,799
Greenberg I think that they use white

405
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:38,700
least you have a similar like beef

406
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:40,740
script code by their owns a copy kitten

407
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,289
they use whitelist if I remember well on

408
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,539
the IP level so you will see at a row

409
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:49,530
direction that you don't the server will

410
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:51,830
never answer and bad rabbit bad rabbit

411
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:55,530
so they are targeting your country

412
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:58,080
obviously there is no specific watering

413
00:23:55,530 --> 00:24:01,408
holes on their stuff they just activate

414
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:05,908
the server for few years a few years few

415
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:08,130
hours but it's just that and for cyber

416
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:14,880
criminal stuff I have seen something

417
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:15,480
that I was not able to to get the final

418
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,980
payload

419
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:21,669
it's like plot stat dot PNG towards that

420
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,450
and for that bin

421
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:27,639
that info was things like that and

422
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:30,729
they're really on like PNG images and

423
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:33,189
some some JavaScript inside pierre-jean

424
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:35,889
images and I was not able to get the

425
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:39,369
final paid or just caffeine I said to me

426
00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:42,968
when it just takes about scans so there

427
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:47,468
is nothing to sleep here okay okay last

428
00:24:42,969 --> 00:24:50,950
question here that one you need some

429
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:52,779
coffee or one this morning yes I have a

430
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:56,049
question about the crypto mining that

431
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:58,739
you mentioned so the first one was does

432
00:24:56,049 --> 00:25:01,809
the crypto mining occur after a redirect

433
00:24:58,739 --> 00:25:04,929
and also how common is that compared to

434
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:08,349
other kind of attacks and does it target

435
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:11,369
specific crypto currencies yeah I've

436
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:17,649
seen crypto mining or many many websites

437
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:20,529
my demo just sorry on many gov website

438
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:24,248
and I think which can be a good idea

439
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:26,409
just to crystallize all the crypto

440
00:25:24,249 --> 00:25:30,669
campaigns mining campaigns with their

441
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:34,209
own key ID like for coin I've I haven't

442
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:36,639
seen every any related crypto mining

443
00:25:34,209 --> 00:25:38,889
campaign so on big websites for example

444
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:41,019
on the French media website or I don't

445
00:25:38,889 --> 00:25:44,109
know I haven't seen them I monitor them

446
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:49,509
that I haven't seen I combined like that

447
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:52,359
today but yes the only one that I think

448
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:53,799
that they were targeted it was like the

449
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,349
previous week the Moldavian in

450
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:59,499
government if I remember well and I

451
00:25:56,349 --> 00:26:02,168
suppose I I spotted this crypto manning

452
00:25:59,499 --> 00:26:04,570
script and if I remember well the

453
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:07,359
website were not on the same server so I

454
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:10,718
think it was very targeted why I don't

455
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,340
know thanks Felix

456
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:15,740
thanks again

457
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,740
[Applause]
