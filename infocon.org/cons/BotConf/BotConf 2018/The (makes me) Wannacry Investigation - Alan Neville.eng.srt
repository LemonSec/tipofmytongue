1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,529
present some of our findings from

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:07,710
semantics perspective on wanna cry and

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:09,660
our investigation and this is actually

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:16,199
my first time up I'll come on first time

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:17,670
speaking so I am be kind and if I send a

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,359
bit weird I'm also suffering from a cold

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,550
so I'm don't worry about that if I sound

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,820
a bit odd and so the wanna cry

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,900
investigation and was something that was

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,000
kind of a big thing for us in terms of

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,489
we start seeing some massive increases

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,829
in kind of exploitation attempts for

13
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,809
maternal blue and it was one of those

14
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,120
things that was happening on a Friday it

15
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,949
was coming into the afternoon and when

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,680
we start seeing these red flags but

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,579
these amount of detection attempts we

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,190
knew that it was going to be something

19
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,930
that was massive and was our team that

20
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,140
were called in so a bit of background

21
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,280
for myself as well and I've been working

22
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,890
with Symantec for the last eight years

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,469
or so I'm initially I came in as a

24
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,030
reverse engineer and we kind of pull

25
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,280
apart malware kind of figure out what it

26
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,780
does and then we write and the text and

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,600
signatures for our different protection

28
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,640
technologies and later I joined a team

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,490
called the attack investigations team so

30
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,240
kind of our role is looking at high

31
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,970
profile attacks and we do a lot of

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,500
tracking of apt groups as well and we

33
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,330
kind of feed all our information that we

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,979
kind of get into other teams within

35
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,369
Symantec to help protect our customers a

36
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:32,429
little bit further so an overview of the

37
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,079
talk just to kind of give you a sense of

38
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,460
where you stand in it and it's short

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,408
enough I'll try to keep within the 30

40
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,809
minutes so to some time for questions as

41
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,060
well and so we have a bit of background

42
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,130
and about one a cry which most views

43
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,869
would be our familiar with so kind of an

44
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,179
a roundup of what we were able to find

45
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:51,540
out based on what was publicized and

46
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,040
we'll talk about our investigation so in

47
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,229
a lot of cases and people were

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,680
interested in trying to identify where

49
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:01,860
the attack was coming from and for us we

50
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,810
were able to identify an earlier variant

51
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,479
that was used that predated the May

52
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,340
attacks and enough kind of gave us the

53
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,649
most amount of insight into the

54
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,730
attackers and links to other groups and

55
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,470
other activities which we'll discuss

56
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,750
tonight

57
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:18,260
and allows to talk about those links

58
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,240
what we found some shared code and kind

59
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,980
of any the other relates activity that

60
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,030
we found as part of that as well and

61
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,299
then we'll just kind of wrap it up with

62
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,980
some lessons learned and some takeaways

63
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,600
so the background itself so before I

64
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,540
kind of talked about wanna cry I kind of

65
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,590
want to put things in to talk about kind

66
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,329
of context to put things into

67
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,020
perspective so when people talk about

68
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:41,000
Massive Attack's and that were and super

69
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,530
impactful some of the names are kind of

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,180
slope to the top are you gee blaster and

71
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,790
this is kind of a super old world back

72
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:49,490
from 2003 and and this is where we seen

73
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,679
like 16 million machines that were

74
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:54,170
infected in a single day which is a

75
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,090
massive number a similar wound uh kind

76
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,540
of flows the top was corn our conficker

77
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,460
so am configure had up to 15 million

78
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,590
machines that have been affected within

79
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:08,150
a 24 hour period and this was kind of

80
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:11,720
later on in November 2008 but then we

81
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,530
had one a cry in May um and the number

82
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,230
solana cry

83
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,630
were relatively small in comparison to

84
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:21,170
some of the other big attacks we only

85
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:23,660
seen around like 300,000 or maybe a

86
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:26,420
little bit more and machines ever have

87
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:30,500
been infected by wanna cry and this is

88
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:33,670
kind of bit odd and the reason why this

89
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,020
is is because of the impact are hot so

90
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:38,299
what happened was when people came into

91
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:41,570
work they were turning on machines they

92
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:43,430
started receiving are seeing this and

93
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:47,030
went to the machine on basically

94
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:50,150
requesting and payment of bitcoins work

95
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,610
to bid $300 and informing them that

96
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,050
their machine had been and held to

97
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:56,510
ransom and doctor files have been

98
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,010
encrypted and and this is obviously more

99
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,018
impactful than what you see well some of

100
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,760
the other and a big threat sure we had

101
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:03,320
mult are millions of machines affected

102
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,929
where those trucks was run in the

103
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,220
background and but this was more

104
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,810
impactful than that it was being

105
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:15,190
disruptive it was stopping productivity

106
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:17,810
and when I say impacts what I mean is

107
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,160
when we start seeing some of the reports

108
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,839
kind of floating around some social

109
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,300
media platforms people posting pictures

110
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,000
and some media outlets reporting on some

111
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,530
of those too

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,210
disruptions are actually incurred by

113
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,340
this and we start seeing attacks that

114
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,430
were on Billboard's whatever becoming

115
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:35,190
locked we've seen kiosks emergency

116
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:40,830
departments between train stations in

117
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:44,130
Germany and ATMs home TVs even the NHS

118
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,890
in the UK and even FedEx as well so this

119
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,840
was apparent that it was a massive issue

120
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:50,430
and this is was why our team was called

121
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,140
in on this to be able to kind of help

122
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,150
other teams it's smart to kind of figure

123
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,490
what was going on header were doing or

124
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,169
spreading and if there was any links to

125
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,820
other groups and you know in a tux and

126
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:01,020
what we could do to kind of help our

127
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,409
customers gonna protect themselves from

128
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,080
that and in terms of distribution when

129
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,940
we start looking at some of the

130
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,039
exploitation attempts from eternal blue

131
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,860
and we seen a massive surge which

132
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,960
occurred on May 12th and this is what

133
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,190
kind of set off red flags for us and we

134
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,140
knew it's going to be a long weekend at

135
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,790
this stage and this is kind of why I

136
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,650
kind of led into that makes me want to

137
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,360
cry because we knew was gonna be a

138
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,890
painful investigation from our side

139
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,930
particularly the fact that we're gonna

140
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,479
have to pull in resources and over the

141
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:33,260
weekend and what we seen was the initial

142
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,450
search moved around to so very detailed

143
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:39,570
machines are had been attempting to

144
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,190
spread what a cry but then we seen some

145
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,190
initial drop off as we entered the

146
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,510
weekend and followed by a resurgence

147
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,310
later on and it was likely that this

148
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,310
resurgence was caused by people coming

149
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,390
back in over the weekend on Monday and

150
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,350
then turning on their machines and then

151
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:56,520
finding that it was infected we also

152
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,780
took out the day they were able to

153
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,060
collect from our Kalama tree and just

154
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,460
kind of mapped it out over time across

155
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:06,030
the heat map and we found out some of

156
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:08,520
the countries that were impacted and

157
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:11,039
kind of early on I kind of had mass of

158
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,500
numbers in terms of infections and was

159
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,270
the likes of like Russia China Brazil

160
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,700
and these are kind of countries that

161
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,340
have really good internet access both

162
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,710
they for whatever reason have a lot of

163
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,330
on part systems and these were the

164
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,010
countries that we start seeing reports

165
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,890
come from in the early days when one

166
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:31,080
Akari start spreading in terms of

167
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,539
spreading itself and there's a couple of

168
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,820
message that it uses so em the first is

169
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,840
where is enumerates all the network

170
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,990
adapters

171
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,909
and detect IP information about their

172
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,710
system may have infected it'll generate

173
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,990
a list of IP addresses within those

174
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:49,039
subnets and then essentially try to

175
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:52,169
connect to all those machines and

176
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,990
connect a report four four five attempt

177
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:56,698
to make a successful connection if a

178
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,949
successful connection is actually made

179
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,560
it will then prepare and the eternal

180
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:03,840
blue exploit to be able to deploy want

181
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,610
to cry on to those remote machines and

182
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,070
it will also generate a random IP

183
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,810
address so it'll generate up to 128

184
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,880
random IP addresses it will attempt a

185
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,250
connection with them and if a connection

186
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,260
is successful again it'll prepare the

187
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,680
turnable you exploit and then it will

188
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,990
try to deploy I have one a cry on to

189
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,660
those machines for any time I had a

190
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:27,630
successful connection and it would then

191
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,389
scan and all the IPS from one to two to

192
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:31,710
five within that same I am subnet to be

193
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:39,330
able to seeker to connect any of those

194
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:43,138
ones so the kill switch itself so in the

195
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:44,789
code and there was basically a higher

196
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:48,870
Kota domain which was an unregistered

197
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:51,389
domain and this domain and basically

198
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,280
worked as a type of kill switch so if a

199
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:55,860
connection could be made to this domain

200
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,989
and a successful response was given back

201
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,220
and it would then essentially terminate

202
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,910
itself so it wouldn't continue spreading

203
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,190
and Marketo Marcus and how to identify

204
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,349
this and he registered a domain as part

205
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,880
of his botnet truckin so I think at the

206
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:10,650
time he even admitted that he wasn't

207
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,780
aware that it was actually kills which

208
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,310
he just seen an unregistered domain as

209
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,979
part of his analysis and then registered

210
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,260
after Lane and I think he had a story up

211
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:21,060
on his blog kind of detailing kind of

212
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,430
the circumstances on the events and it

213
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,840
kind of led to understanding why it

214
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,330
actually became a kill switch at a later

215
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,880
stage so it was theorized that this was

216
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:32,490
likely used to evade sound boxing so in

217
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,860
most sandbox environments and you'll

218
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,349
generally see people submit samples and

219
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,130
they'll want to be able to capture or

220
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:43,709
fake and I am c2 or command and control

221
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,480
and every social responses and basically

222
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,920
to extract see too quickly and usually

223
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,640
to kind of cluster malware in later

224
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,209
stages

225
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,550
and we started sinkhole domain which

226
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:55,979
stopped the spreading of wanna cry which

227
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,990
was a really good thing and but what we

228
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,450
kind of gave us tips to some of our

229
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:03,240
customers was instead of relying on an

230
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:05,779
external domain I ensure that you create

231
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,899
DNS entries for any of their local

232
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:11,250
machines so it resolves to machine

233
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,170
that's within your own network that you

234
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,670
control so your own private sink own as

235
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,740
such and the reason why we were doing

236
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,569
this was while people were relying on

237
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,500
this external domain they were adding

238
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:24,480
the unready domain to and their white

239
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,060
lists and which kind of presented a

240
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,310
couple of issues one there was reports

241
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,699
of attacks being performed so DDoS

242
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:35,430
attacks on and from the mayor botanist

243
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:39,570
against the domain de or the sink holder

244
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:41,819
and our tech was running and and if that

245
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,610
had succeeded then it would have allowed

246
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,320
what a quite a spread even further and

247
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:48,899
there was also kind of the ability

248
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,130
whereby if a later stages people had

249
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,410
forgotten that they had added this

250
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,570
domain into their other white into their

251
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,890
white lists and the domain became one

252
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,240
registered and then start being used for

253
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,519
malicious purposes later stage they've

254
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,600
effectively given a free pass so this

255
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,410
was something that we were kind of

256
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,390
suggesting is best practice for them and

257
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,339
in terms of payment and it seemed like

258
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,110
the guys who created one equai kind of

259
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,440
made a few mistakes or kind of hurried

260
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:16,230
and development of the tool itself so it

261
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,740
looked like and there was a point where

262
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,720
a decrypter or sorry a Bitcoin generator

263
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,540
so a Bitcoin address generator was

264
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,949
supposed to be dropped to disk and when

265
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,750
you were looking at the code itself it

266
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:31,920
looked like it was calling the Bitcoin

267
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,839
address generator before I was even

268
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,849
written to disk so this was kind of a

269
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,350
big thing whereby it wasn't able to

270
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,140
generate a unique address for each

271
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,790
infection and which meant that it

272
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,470
actually had to fall back to some

273
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:47,040
default values that have been hard coded

274
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,839
in and to the samples themselves well 13

275
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,250
hours later they also tried to release a

276
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,589
fix for this but at this point the

277
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,149
damage had been done and mitigation had

278
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:55,500
been kind of rolled out across different

279
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:57,510
organizations to kill switch had been

280
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,240
put in place so it kind of didn't have

281
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,869
much

282
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,730
and a fact lady so without a unique

283
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:07,439
Bitcoin address generator and a

284
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:09,369
defaulted to the tree kind of had

285
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:11,649
defiled addresses that were embedded

286
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:14,100
within the sample itself and the

287
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:16,209
attackers were demanding around $300 in

288
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,249
bitcoins and then saying that it might

289
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:20,529
double in price after three days if

290
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:22,600
there was no payment received and after

291
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:24,490
seven days and the attackers also

292
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,499
claimed that files would be lost or

293
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,999
modified and but there was actually no

294
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:29,410
evidence of this so even when we looked

295
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:30,639
at the code itself we couldn't see

296
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:33,249
anything in there that would actually

297
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:36,670
try to delete the files or even modify

298
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:38,589
them after this time period and last

299
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:41,050
time I checked there was around $90,000

300
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:44,439
in the Bitcoin address that I had been

301
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:48,160
paid and it may have changed since for

302
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:53,319
likely and even when it kind of came to

303
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,610
the dead line in terms of the render

304
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:57,189
time that the attackers had given people

305
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,600
to kind of pay up the ransom we've seen

306
00:11:57,189 --> 00:12:00,849
that it kind of made a last-place so

307
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,019
they were sending out messages and which

308
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,899
is kind of funny because their start

309
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:09,759
referring to her as victims as customers

310
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:14,470
in this case so for our investigation

311
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:16,869
and identifying the vector of the attack

312
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:19,240
was kind of super difficult and this was

313
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:21,100
mainly down to a couple of reasons

314
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,049
so the first one was kind of larger

315
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,240
number of organizations were in practice

316
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:27,850
at the amount of organizations that were

317
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,319
impacted and by the stress and also a

318
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,529
large amount of traffic that had been

319
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:34,059
generated by the spreading and of won

320
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:35,799
acclaim and this made it difficult to

321
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:38,110
then dig through like your telemetry and

322
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:39,670
dick tree logs kind of identify that

323
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,769
first machine that had been affected

324
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,889
particularly when it was a likely gonna

325
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:46,059
be outside of your own customer base and

326
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:47,139
and it was a lot of it was a big thing

327
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:48,790
for a lot of groups that we were in

328
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:50,619
talking about this turn at the time they

329
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,118
wanted to find patient zero and they

330
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:54,369
thought that this would be kind of the

331
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:56,679
way to be able to identify how it

332
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:57,999
initially got on like did it for example

333
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:00,730
was it received by an email that then

334
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:02,290
start spreading and but this was kind of

335
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,350
some of the questions that the group's

336
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,779
wanted to answer and for us what we

337
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,430
actually ate was how to look off the

338
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:11,770
samples that we had collected ourselves

339
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,239
and we kind of tore it apart a bit and

340
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:17,260
then look for kind of some unique

341
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:20,080
markers and we created a somewhat loose

342
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:23,020
signature that we could then use to kind

343
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,270
of query or search across our big file

344
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,650
repository and we actually got a couple

345
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:29,319
of hits which is a bit odd because the

346
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,880
hits that we got were additional samples

347
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,830
that look like one a cry but they

348
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,020
weren't and even now had been reported

349
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,730
as part of the May attacks and what we

350
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,350
did was we took those samples and then

351
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,200
we found him against our Kalama tree to

352
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:43,120
see was there any customers that had and

353
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,470
been impacted by these samples and we

354
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,630
actually found with six organizations

355
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,580
and this predated the attacks that we

356
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:50,620
had in May all the way back to February

357
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,940
and so this obviously was a big thing

358
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,620
for us so we wanted to kind of jump in

359
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,180
on this I kind of figure out what was

360
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,000
going on was talking activities around

361
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:00,489
her and was this are essentially patient

362
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,260
zero and this what gave us the most

363
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,600
insight to these attacks I allow just

364
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:07,870
kind of create links to other groups and

365
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,510
other activity that we are later talked

366
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,070
about so when we first found these new

367
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,530
samples we kind of had a quick look to

368
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:17,260
see what similarities to water or what

369
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:19,060
differences there was and the first main

370
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,130
difference was it didn't contain the

371
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,839
aterna bloom exploit code at all and

372
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:25,060
this was something that was like oh

373
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,550
right this is a big thing this is

374
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,619
something that my pre days and when

375
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,939
internal blue was actually added to want

376
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:35,050
to cry so we dug this version one and

377
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,430
some of the similarities so these are

378
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,290
some of the similar or kind of

379
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,839
simplistic one so I did a cryptic

380
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:43,510
filename for example and Warner

381
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:46,240
decrypter products he used exclamations

382
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:48,790
instead of odd symbols and the component

383
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,650
files in the archives that was better

384
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:52,660
within the resources and followed

385
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,250
similar naming conventions and the

386
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:57,400
configuration format was identical

387
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,780
across the two samples and the passwords

388
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,670
used to encrypt the archive that was

389
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,560
embedded within it were somewhat similar

390
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:07,510
as well so the kind of reference while I

391
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:10,119
cry for the first victim that we

392
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:12,400
actually found and this was our February

393
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,840
victim and we weren't able to retrieve a

394
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,730
full timeline of the events that

395
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,560
happened on the machine but we started

396
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:20,970
looking at I need events around

397
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:23,229
we seem wanna cry version 1 on this and

398
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,389
within this organization and we found

399
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,939
some additional tools on some activity

400
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:30,339
there the first one was we've seen many

401
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:32,680
cuts have been deployed and had been

402
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:34,420
used dope credentials from the machine

403
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,339
that had been affected and those

404
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:40,839
credentials were then later stored into

405
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:42,879
a file called cgw ry and and then

406
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:45,670
another till watch which kind of looked

407
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:48,249
like a network scanner and called HP

408
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:50,559
tasks and was also deployed onto that

409
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:52,930
machine and it looks like the attackers

410
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:55,329
could provide a command line argument

411
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:57,758
which would allow it to assert our

412
00:15:55,329 --> 00:16:00,160
search through an IP range and and

413
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,430
basically attempt to mount remote chairs

414
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:07,329
using the credentials from that cg w ry

415
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:09,540
file and if it was able to create a

416
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:12,209
successful connection it would then

417
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,889
essentially add this to a log file and

418
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:16,899
then it would copy some wanna cry

419
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:19,059
components and from version one across

420
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:20,529
onto these machines and the table that

421
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:22,389
I've listed here kind of gives you some

422
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:25,269
details of some of those components that

423
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:26,680
were copied across so we seen like an

424
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:27,910
the application for displaying the

425
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,309
messages which were stored in some

426
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:32,980
additional files we also had the one

427
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:35,050
acquire encryption component itself the

428
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,540
configuration details and then the

429
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:39,490
message files so most of your files are

430
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:42,309
encrypted or the instructions of how to

431
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:47,740
be able to pay and your Bitcoin ransom

432
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:50,379
and the February victim as well and we

433
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:53,500
also seen that this HP task till was

434
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:56,019
also the tool that was used to execute

435
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,870
the newly copied one account samples on

436
00:16:56,019 --> 00:17:01,019
these remote machines and and we also

437
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:03,550
had identify some additional tools and

438
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,890
back doors that were on the infected

439
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:08,230
machines as well and we weren't able at

440
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,760
the time to kind of make any additional

441
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,470
links but when we started looking at

442
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,939
some of the victims from March and April

443
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,740
that kind of cleared up the picture

444
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,270
first so some of the tools that we did

445
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,510
find in this organization was a hawk

446
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,809
tail we caught desta over-involved mer

447
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:25,158
downloader and

448
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:27,619
we had some proxy tools as well so the

449
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:29,840
March and April victims so we had signs

450
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:31,580
of additional victims and we had at

451
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,139
least five organizations that we had

452
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:37,039
identified I have been impacted in

453
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:39,678
throughout this period and new samples

454
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,749
of one car I modified versions of one

455
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,149
acquired version one had been prepared

456
00:17:41,749 --> 00:17:45,919
for each of these victims and they have

457
00:17:44,149 --> 00:17:47,809
been delivered when we looked at the

458
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,700
victimology itself it kind of seemed a

459
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:52,789
bit odd and majority of all these

460
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:55,490
victims were actually located and within

461
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:58,279
Asia and but there was no real pattern

462
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:01,249
to the type of industries that were

463
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:03,980
being impacted so we had organizations

464
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:05,869
from government hospitality and chemical

465
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,759
industries but the only kind of pattern

466
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:09,320
that kind of emerged from that was they

467
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,289
were all organizations none of them were

468
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,389
individuals or consumers and we also

469
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:16,158
found some additional backdoors and this

470
00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:17,508
is what kind of gave us the most amount

471
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:20,419
of information linking it back to

472
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:22,009
previous attacks and within these

473
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:24,110
organizations we had seen in some cases

474
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:26,480
a new backdoor that hadn't been

475
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,189
identified before called children of Alf

476
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,649
nack had been identified and we had

477
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,960
evidence of this to being used to deploy

478
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:35,658
one equai and we also had another

479
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,909
backdoor called Trojan of Bravo neck and

480
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:40,519
we also were able to find evidence of

481
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:45,889
this being used to deploy one occurring

482
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:48,230
in some of these victims so an alpha

483
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:51,498
knock itself had been used drop wanna

484
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:53,419
cry entry victims and it's a slightly

485
00:18:51,499 --> 00:18:55,009
modified version that was deployed to

486
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:58,369
each of these are within each of these

487
00:18:55,009 --> 00:19:01,460
environments and the backdoor itself um

488
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:03,289
I've been copied onto the machines and

489
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,970
then we've seen two minutes later many

490
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:07,899
cuts being deployed through that tool

491
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:11,960
and many carts were then executed

492
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:15,408
so essentially dumped the credentials

493
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,610
and then it would install WinRAR to be

494
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:17,869
able to collect those credentials and

495
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:21,619
move it off to some attacker control

496
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:23,749
every software and later we seen another

497
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:25,730
tool called G dot exe been deployed and

498
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:28,070
just performed UNESCO cops and this was

499
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:29,700
used basically to identify some machines

500
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,500
that were of value to the attacker

501
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,540
so and they used that to profile in

502
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,770
network research and the return and even

503
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,110
connected some additional information at

504
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,940
later stages we also found some

505
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,800
additional tools are also seen in the

506
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,090
February victim as well so again that

507
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,340
kind of network scanning tool that we

508
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:47,100
identified and that was used to deploy I

509
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,310
wanna cry and also being used to execute

510
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,080
the samples on those remote machines

511
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:54,659
Bravo knock yourself and was so much

512
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,030
different in the US and it actually used

513
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,450
a set of common passwords and to be able

514
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:03,420
to connect SMB shares and in order to

515
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:06,120
copy across wanna cry and we also found

516
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,620
other variants of Bravo NOC which

517
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,939
actually contain one acquire embedded

518
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:13,739
within itself so the links and related

519
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,120
activity so I'll try get to fit as

520
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,680
quickly only probably take a couple of

521
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,510
minutes because I want to open it up for

522
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,800
questions as well and we fair some

523
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:22,200
network are shared that were code

524
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,460
between and doozer and al-falaq and

525
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,200
doozer is a tool that was used by the

526
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,540
group Lazarus and previous attacks and

527
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,310
it had similar code for generating the

528
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,889
buffer that was used for command and

529
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:34,290
control communications and somewhat of a

530
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,200
fake SSL handshake and a generated

531
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:39,420
random number which was then used to

532
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:42,120
look up a table and to send some data to

533
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,310
the SI toos and this table was identical

534
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,719
across the two samples and which it was

535
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,929
a kind of strong indication that this

536
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,280
was a shared call between these two and

537
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:52,170
they also repented the same kind of

538
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,350
marker or a signature to the start of on

539
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:56,580
ec2 communications as well when we

540
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,469
decrypted some of the strings within the

541
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,669
two samples so alpha knock inducer we

542
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,410
found that the decrypted strings were

543
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,240
pretty much identical for the most part

544
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:06,210
and this again was a strong indicator

545
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:09,150
that there was overlap and we also film

546
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:11,010
an overlap with Bravo knock on user

547
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:13,080
again and in doctors

548
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:16,410
kind of shared cryptographic and number

549
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:18,540
of related routines and there was also

550
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,640
some additional share code that was

551
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:23,820
called out by Google so Neil had

552
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,490
actually posted two hashes and some

553
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:29,129
address and locations the first hash was

554
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:31,980
one acquired a second was a variant of

555
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:34,710
canta P and again kanta p has been used

556
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,570
by lazarus and this group which had been

557
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:39,540
used against several banks in the past

558
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,379
and we also had shared code which was

559
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:43,770
part of our course

560
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,750
sedimentation so generally in openness

561
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:47,280
le of around 300 plus ciphers that you

562
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,320
can choose from and this implementation

563
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,280
it was limited to about 75 and we'd only

564
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,750
seen that across these two samples and

565
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,870
there was also other chip-ins from other

566
00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:00,420
people kind of identifying that this was

567
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:05,909
part of Lazarus and as you can see there

568
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:07,950
from cousins Yarra will and there's also

569
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,110
some temporal attribution as well so in

570
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:12,330
some of the victims we also found and

571
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:15,120
some additional Lazarus till so we had

572
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:17,159
asked over and involved mer and there's

573
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,649
been many links kind of already

574
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:23,010
documented between those two and we also

575
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:25,170
seen al sac and being used in another

576
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,490
sample which was a job inquiry resume

577
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,140
which kind of suggested maybe this

578
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:30,990
initially was impacting these

579
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,340
organizations through email so I'm gonna

580
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:35,550
shared infrastructure as well we also

581
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:37,709
had shared C and C's so we had Doozer

582
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:40,350
which connected to two IPS one of which

583
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:42,840
had been also a CNC for children of

584
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:45,719
Bravo knack and we also had alpha naki

585
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:48,899
which was also contacting a CT which was

586
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,180
found in the same file and that in turn

587
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,310
also AM contacted under I Peter would

588
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:57,870
share between dr. otaku pops another

589
00:22:53,310 --> 00:23:00,419
Lazarus - so we are able to assign some

590
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:02,459
confidence value cities under links we

591
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,140
had network infrastructure overlap which

592
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,690
we had hard links on our kind of high

593
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,600
confidence same infiltration in terms of

594
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:12,060
the tools that were and found we also

595
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,129
had shared code which kind of range

596
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,240
between a kind of medium to weak but

597
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,800
when you kind of put them all together

598
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,110
it kind of suggested to us that this was

599
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:22,290
a high confidence and we all saw till

600
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,820
co-occurrence so and lazarus tools on

601
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:25,649
impacted victims that we had want to cry

602
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,200
and we also kind of had some techniques

603
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:31,080
which we considered weak so like the use

604
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,550
of hard coded SMB credentials and

605
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,350
password this to be able to spread over

606
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:36,629
SMB which was also seen in other tools

607
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:41,610
used by a la Souris in the past so since

608
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:43,740
Jonah so the lessons learned were pretty

609
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:46,229
bad Apache and the patch had being

610
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,390
released about a month previous and but

611
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,950
yes we still had and all these victims

612
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:52,470
that have been impacted by wanna cry and

613
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,799
either for reasons like OEM equipment

614
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,860
legal certificate

615
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:59,289
reasons or kind of rogue devices we're

616
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,850
still bad at performing backups and a

617
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:02,950
lot of people that I was talking to have

618
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:04,779
said oh it's cool I have really good

619
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:06,460
restoration plans in place but when you

620
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:08,289
ask them what happens when you're the

621
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,210
directory server is knocked offline or

622
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:12,039
your network is down how can you restore

623
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,110
them and they were pretty much kind of

624
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:16,629
plain that they were essentially dead in

625
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:18,158
the water at that stage and there's no

626
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:19,238
such thing as your perimeter so a lot of

627
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,909
other people were saying oh I've blocked

628
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:22,360
port for four or five on my firewall I'm

629
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:24,549
good

630
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:28,959
but that's not really the case why

631
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:30,249
you'll see a lot of kind of issues are

632
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,570
kind of public we need to use byline

633
00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:33,399
let's say for example machines coming

634
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:36,820
into your network and linked to motor

635
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:39,008
vendors to your corporate network and

636
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,869
other things as well which kind of open

637
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:43,090
your perimeter so that line between your

638
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:46,959
perimeter and order other parameters can

639
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:50,649
kind of become more ambiguous and a bit

640
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,419
more blurred as such as security in

641
00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:54,219
published and procedures and continuity

642
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:55,690
planning does work Friday the customers

643
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,399
that we talked that didn't get impacted

644
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,779
by this they had really good policies in

645
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:00,488
place they had really good procedures

646
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:02,619
and continuity planning there and they

647
00:25:00,489 --> 00:25:03,789
were able for any ones that were

648
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:06,178
impacted they were able to quickly

649
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:09,340
restore services and get back to working

650
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:11,320
so the takeaways wanna cry is extremely

651
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:14,109
disruptive attack and the leak of

652
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,840
eternal blue was the reason why this

653
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:19,480
turned into a global threat and expected

654
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,009
losses and productivity and an efforts

655
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,499
to mitigate were significant because of

656
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:25,570
this attack and we found multiple strong

657
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:29,049
links to previous attacks conducted by

658
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:30,609
Lazarus and we had overlaps in some kind

659
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:33,129
of technical aspects like code sharing

660
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:35,499
and c2

661
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:37,779
communications and he also had previous

662
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:40,269
well documented and links to other

663
00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:42,369
attacks such as the attacks on Sony with

664
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:45,070
test over and Bangladesh central bank

665
00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:46,959
account EP and we also had despite the

666
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:49,809
links Lazarus it doesn't look like that

667
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,539
it was and paired kind of hallmarks of a

668
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:54,279
nation stays and kind of type of

669
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:55,749
campaign and for the fact that it was

670
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:58,119
looked like that the till was hurriedly

671
00:25:55,749 --> 00:26:00,179
put together and while it might being

672
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:02,740
inducted by Lazarus it looks like it was

673
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:05,710
possibly financially motivated initially

674
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,690
but either Accardo or something happened

675
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,980
where and they basically have weaponized

676
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,950
way to turn a blue and I kind of spread

677
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:22,450
be under control and finally we're still

678
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:24,429
about a patching oh thank you thank you

679
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,260
Alan for the talk and sorry we cannot

680
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:28,090
take a questions at this time because we

681
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:31,029
have better over time but you can catch

682
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:34,659
probably Alan during the break and ask

683
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:35,470
him questions yeah I think not

684
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,480
