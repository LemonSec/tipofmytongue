1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,850
it's in principle an alteration of

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:09,019
Manoir behavior by close observation so

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,670
as I say I'm from Argentina I am a

4
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:15,480
researcher a teacher and a master

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:18,750
student well Argentina in South America

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,750
and I'm from Mendoza which is in the

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,180
west of Fort Antonia well I wanted to

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,448
show you some pictures from where I'm

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:31,980
from for where I am from so that's it

10
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:34,260
I am I work in the I T IC Research

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,450
Institute which belong to the National

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,989
Universities of course--i which is one

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:43,620
of the biggest university in the region

14
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:46,078
well I start with the presentation so

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,379
first I will start with a motivation on

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,690
the contribution next I will talk in a

17
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,809
bit about background and the anomic

18
00:00:51,690 --> 00:01:00,030
project then I will be talking about the

19
00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:03,358
HTTP data set which generated general an

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,369
analysis and conclusion to finally talk

21
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,640
about the description the conclusion and

22
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:11,430
the future work so the motivation of our

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,830
work was that we wanted to study the

24
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,619
influence of practicing interceptor in

25
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:21,840
my world behavior so for my wall

26
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:24,210
analysis so our contribution are three

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,750
points mostly the first one is the

28
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,548
creation of a network malware data set

29
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:32,369
and the goal was to capture network

30
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:37,829
traffic that was using encrypted

31
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:40,619
channels meaning tls/ssl or port 443 so

32
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:45,329
we proposed two scenarios the first one

33
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:48,658
with a proxy interception we used mi mi

34
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:51,750
TM proxy and the second scenario was

35
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,329
without any interception at all the

36
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,840
second contribution of this work is the

37
00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:01,500
publication of the data set we share it

38
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,899
on our blog and on Twitter and the third

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:09,598
one is the analysis of the malware

40
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:12,630
capture behavior well as background I

41
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:15,149
mean I imagine that everyone

42
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,880
heard about TLS which is a network

43
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,880
protocol to encrypt information that

44
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,010
means that all the information between

45
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,900
two points between a source and a

46
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,299
destination when the channel is

47
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:32,040
established all the information passing

48
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:34,080
through will be encrypted on the other

49
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,769
hand we know that malware is evolving

50
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,770
and is increasing and this evolution

51
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:43,950
make my work even harder to detect

52
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:46,500
because the behavior changes and one of

53
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:51,540
the evolution is that malware is using

54
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,940
now HTTPS SSL or TLS and this makes them

55
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,790
even harder to detect them

56
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:02,910
one example is the banking Trojans or

57
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:07,079
for example seals so in this context the

58
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:09,810
nomads project or Isis was born sorry

59
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,350
and this is a project between Cisco

60
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:17,100
Systems ETA and the Technical University

61
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,570
and Czech Republic in plan and in

62
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,000
collaboration with the National

63
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:25,200
University of cosas and the goal of this

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:30,030
project was to collect Marwa captures

65
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:33,239
that was using encrypted channels it was

66
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:37,350
a project to help cisco system to study

67
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:42,720
the this kind of malware and to us to

68
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:45,150
analyze still captures so we generated

69
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,310
it data set that now contains more than

70
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,340
one hangry at fifteen Marwar captures

71
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:53,850
and they are all available online if you

72
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,310
want to access you can do it it contains

73
00:03:53,850 --> 00:04:00,450
different types of malware meaning

74
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:03,030
bonnet trojans artwork any kind in order

75
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:06,450
to obtain a good quality malware data

76
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,400
set we first studied the malware meaning

77
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:13,200
we have to check if the malware was

78
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,510
using HTTPS and then we kept the

79
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,329
infection running the most of the time

80
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:22,380
we could for weeks or even month when it

81
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:24,539
was possible and this is our

82
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,070
infrastructure this is the

83
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,230
infrastructure

84
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,110
we used for this project so we have a

85
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:34,080
Linux host with 30 virtual machines and

86
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:37,260
we were using VirtualBox to visualize

87
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,599
them there is a web in the first

88
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,900
scenario there is a webpart redirection

89
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,030
and we are using the proxy and then the

90
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,659
goal the traffic goes directly to the

91
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:50,789
Internet we also have a honeypot and we

92
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,250
have a database with all the binaries

93
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:56,700
that were used we are using for the

94
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:58,770
manuals so we copied about the winery's

95
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,860
to the server and then we execute it to

96
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:04,349
the individual machines in the second

97
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,390
scenario is almost the same as the first

98
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,940
one but we don't have any paltry

99
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:14,070
directions so the traffic goes directly

100
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:18,630
to the Internet the methodology we're

101
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:20,820
following is these five steps so first

102
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:25,740
we have to find the malware that was the

103
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:28,500
hardest part we we used a lot SSL

104
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,870
blacklist which is a website well all

105
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,290
the malware that is using encrypted

106
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:38,640
channel are reported so once we find the

107
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:42,330
md5 we found it in on virus sterile and

108
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:46,789
we download it then we copy all the

109
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:50,219
binaries into our server in the database

110
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:53,190
then we start a virtual machine and we

111
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:57,300
compute the start time we execute the

112
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:59,969
malware and we compute the time of the

113
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,850
infection and then we monitor the

114
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:06,930
machine we were using cactii and we were

115
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:09,870
using TCP dump and then we stopped the

116
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:13,080
machine after a while then we generate

117
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:17,100
some output files we generates flow

118
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:19,080
analysis we generate some information

119
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,380
files that you can access there there is

120
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,440
telling an example of the link and we

121
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,540
share it the the information on our blog

122
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:32,030
or on Twitter so you can see in that

123
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:36,930
link that is some blue there is a number

124
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:39,960
181 188 is the number of the malware if

125
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,330
an ID that we gave to each Mara world

126
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,659
it belongs to md5 we can say Oh ash I

127
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:48,630
want so that will be the first capture

128
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,639
using that malware if we want to execute

129
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:57,120
the malware a second time we will put

130
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:59,610
number two and number three and so on so

131
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,080
in order to analyze our malware captures

132
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:07,440
we use the pickup files and in a TM

133
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:11,099
output files mostly and we took him to

134
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,680
consideration our first IP start were

135
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:16,590
contacted by the malware the ports that

136
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,259
were contacted and we also were checking

137
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:26,310
if the communication was encrypted or

138
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:29,130
not this is one of the analysis of one

139
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:33,780
of the captures the name of the malware

140
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:35,969
is what and the idea is 188 for us so as

141
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:39,059
you can see in the first one and fewer

142
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:42,440
three is that there is not a lot of

143
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:45,750
traffic you can see a peak on blue each

144
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:49,919
color means a different kind of traffic

145
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:53,810
so low light will be SSL and there is a

146
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:57,060
peak because the malware and reach the

147
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,080
server the remote server he stablished a

148
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,320
common control

149
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,830
he received the orders and the Milwaukee

150
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,719
the execute execution there are some

151
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,849
Peaks because he tried to connect two

152
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:11,820
different servers but nothing more else

153
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:15,210
was happening however in the second one

154
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:18,240
the my work couldn't reach the server so

155
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:20,099
he was trying to connect so those peak

156
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,460
that you can see are the attempt of the

157
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:26,099
connections so the my wall tried to

158
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:30,120
connect two different servers using port

159
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:32,939
443 and using encrypted communication

160
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:37,169
and it was trying to connect through TCP

161
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:39,450
and through ports 80 and 88 so you can

162
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:43,169
have the link to that malware sample if

163
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:46,680
you want to check them this is another

164
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:50,130
example the name of the malware is ball

165
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:53,620
track which is at Roland and the idea of

166
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:55,630
the capture is 189 and

167
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:59,080
you can see the behavior is pretty

168
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:03,279
similar and we execute the malware in

169
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:06,700
different times and this was using a dg8

170
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:10,450
so he was trying to connect to different

171
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:14,110
servers the connects the connection was

172
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:16,120
successful in both cases in the second

173
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,040
one there is not much traffic at the

174
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,220
beginning because some servers were down

175
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,620
so that's what's the only different but

176
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:28,800
in both cases he could connect to the

177
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:33,370
remote server so here's the discussion

178
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:36,370
in some cases my world could not connect

179
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:39,610
to internet at all they weren't able to

180
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:44,080
communicate at all this was because the

181
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:46,960
Marwar was using a custom protocol so

182
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,570
with the medium trucks interception the

183
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,360
proxy could not understand the protocol

184
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:57,190
and we were seeing this kind of message

185
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,180
of bad requests and that didn't happen

186
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,940
with the same malware

187
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:05,020
you without emitting proxy interception

188
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:08,140
that was the difference so when this

189
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:10,420
happened new behaviors appeared the

190
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,459
first one was that the malware tried to

191
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:16,209
reconnect constantly to the remote

192
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:19,420
server let's say every minute and that's

193
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:20,459
well that was why it was generating a

194
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,400
lot of traffic

195
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:26,349
the second behavior who observed is that

196
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,410
the module was seeking otherwise to

197
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:31,990
connect by looking for different parts

198
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:36,219
to the same IP port for example eight

199
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:38,410
eighty or eighty eight and he tried to

200
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,920
connect two different servers different

201
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:46,060
IPS so that was the change of the

202
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,459
behavior of the Marwar so the conclusion

203
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,839
is that some malware uses a custom

204
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:57,219
protocol and imported we solve it for

205
00:10:51,839 --> 00:11:01,420
HTTP and HTTP meaning 4 4 4 3 port 80

206
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:04,450
and 88 and blocking this connection by

207
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:07,449
the proxy it generates new mile war

208
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:09,730
behaviors so we

209
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:13,140
now we can say that malware behavior can

210
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:15,970
change because of the interception proxy

211
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,540
so a proxy interception should be

212
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:22,330
careful consider when implement

213
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:25,240
analyzing the malware behavior so also

214
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:29,110
our data set is available so if anyone

215
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:35,070
can observe anything else yes here you

216
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:38,680
have the link to access as a future work

217
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:41,710
we want to analyze more features we want

218
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,349
to make some reverse binaries we would

219
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:47,050
like to analyze di piece the matter what

220
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:49,530
is connected to the boards because some

221
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:52,660
time supports is changed a lot so we

222
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:55,150
would like to see an intake in detail

223
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:59,850
also the version of the protocol the

224
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:03,310
malware is using and also we like to

225
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:05,680
implement an IOT lab for marvel

226
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,359
executing from our wall using HTTP

227
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,760
because when I was looking for more

228
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,360
samples there were a lot of sample for

229
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:17,620
Android now we want to study the

230
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,050
behavior as well so thank you very much

231
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,760
for listening and if you want to contact

232
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:25,000
me we are looking for collaboration as

233
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,880
well so here's my mail my teacher so

234
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:35,750
thank you very much

235
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:35,750
[Applause]

236
00:12:45,340 --> 00:13:03,140
if you have a question on his date yeah

237
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:07,280
thank you for the very good very nice

238
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:10,580
talk I was wondering whether you had to

239
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,189
deal with sinkhole command and control

240
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:17,690
servers in which you are unable to

241
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:19,640
access them and you have to somewhat try

242
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:25,790
to imitate them in order to record the

243
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:26,930
now we're on HTTPS yeah I'll try to

244
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,740
repeat my question

245
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:32,270
did you have to deal with mouth were

246
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:35,150
specific malware that their command and

247
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:40,610
control servers were sync hold so that

248
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:42,949
you have to imitate them by using or

249
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:52,670
using another server in order to record

250
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:56,150
their HTTP thank you

251
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:59,180
we wanted to use the proxy to analyze

252
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:01,220
the packets in detail but we didn't have

253
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:04,160
that kind of problem actually all the

254
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:09,190
matter was executing well and no I

255
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,189
didn't see anything of that so thank you

256
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,650
no question

257
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:25,619
[Applause]
