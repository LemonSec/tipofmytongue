1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,519
and from tell us of knickers Jason thank

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,490
you for the invitation to speak with you

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,009
today my name is Jason Shoultz I am a

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,669
technical leader with Cisco's Talos

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:26,720
group Talos is responsible for security

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,080
research and intelligence within Cisco

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,779
today

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,110
I want to talk about necker's which is

9
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:35,780
the largest botnet the largest spam bot

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,820
net in the world

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,350
hopefully through efforts such as this

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,480
eventually we will be able to take it

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:47,129
down one day nickers the first mention I

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,849
could find of necker's actually sending

15
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:53,789
spam was back in 2012 Microsoft did a

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:57,510
blog and that was almost 5 years ago to

17
00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:00,270
the day December 6th of 2012 since that

18
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,519
time we've seen a huge amount of spirit

19
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,470
coming from necker's in fact sometimes

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:11,250
it makes up more than 90% of the spam

21
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:12,689
that Cisco sees in any one day so in

22
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,060
this talk today we're going to talk

23
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:17,789
about the composition of the necker's

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,030
botnet where can we find most of the

25
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,920
nodes that are participating how much is

26
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,060
the re how much is the infrastructure

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,860
reused across various spam campaigns how

28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,750
big is the botnet itself which is a

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,070
difficult question to answer

30
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,900
we'll talk a little bit about the

31
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,548
victims of necker's you know who are the

32
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,430
recipients where did these recipients

33
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,909
come from how have they been maintaining

34
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,740
their recipient database over time we'll

35
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,970
took take a look at some examples of

36
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,309
some of the campaign's that they've been

37
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,869
sending and then try to make a stab at

38
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,220
doing a little bit of attribution with

39
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,549
some of the data that we have been able

40
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,740
to recover from some of the campaign's

41
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:58,200
so we're gonna dive right in and talk a

42
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,780
little bit about the data that backs up

43
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,110
this project here so the data that we

44
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,420
got came from spam cop if you're not

45
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,149
familiar with spam cop spam cop is a

46
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,100
free service where people can report

47
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,980
their spam from anywhere

48
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,350
to spam cop spam cop we'll take those

49
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,730
spam reports and create a blacklist of

50
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,060
IP addresses that have been known to

51
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:23,369
have sent spam this service has been

52
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:28,620
operating since about 1998 so we've been

53
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:32,100
at this for almost 20 years I took and

54
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,960
extracted spam campaigns out of spam cop

55
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,510
that we had seen that belong to necker's

56
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,490
I used various elements like the subject

57
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,040
headers which tend to be fairly common

58
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,740
as well as other identifying headers and

59
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,480
elements of the email to extract 32

60
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,450
different campaigns over the course of

61
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,600
four months now that works out to be

62
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,910
about two campaigns per week over the

63
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,630
course of four months I wanted that to

64
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:59,730
be a fairly representative sample in the

65
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,130
end we ended up with over 2.1 million

66
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:06,750
spam messages as part of our set of

67
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:11,000
research data and that was sent by 1.1 9

68
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:13,410
2 million unique sending IP addresses so

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,930
regarding the question of how big the

70
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,130
necker's botnet is you'll see later when

71
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,880
we talk about the reuse of the

72
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:23,579
infrastructure but according to our data

73
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,490
it's definitely well north of 1 million

74
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,730
unique sending IPs those IPS came from

75
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:31,140
216 different countries and territories

76
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:34,829
these are countries or territories with

77
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,510
an ISO two-letter country code and what

78
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,550
did we see I took tried to take

79
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:42,030
representative samples the fake bank

80
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:45,210
statements the fake invoices the dating

81
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,620
spam the pumpin dunk stops to pump and

82
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,510
dump stock spam that they've been

83
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,150
sending fake voicemail messages and more

84
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,840
we'll see some examples later so this

85
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,580
was the data that I started with now one

86
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,110
of the first things that you do when

87
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,490
you're looking at this information is

88
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,130
you want to look at these sending IP

89
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:03,930
addresses and when we broke those out

90
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,140
and we reverse those back to their

91
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,360
geolocation we found some interesting

92
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:12,329
results here and you can see based on

93
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,160
this graph that the majority of the

94
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,650
nodes that we saw participating in

95
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,430
necker's were located in India and

96
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:24,450
Vietnam followed closely by you can see

97
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:28,290
Iran then Pakistan I see we've got

98
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:31,440
Indonesia Brazil Mexico let's see

99
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:34,100
Bangladesh Thailand Colombia

100
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,810
none of these are necessarily

101
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,070
representative of the largest

102
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,200
industrialised nations that we see and

103
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,090
you can see the the top 10 there and

104
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,690
then I've got the next ten that round

105
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,890
out the top 20 and you can see that it

106
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,190
drops off fairly quickly

107
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:51,780
right compare this to the number of

108
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,520
nodes that we've seen in some of the

109
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,849
bigger countries or maybe the countries

110
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,450
with larger populations in the United

111
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:02,280
States we only found six thousand nodes

112
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:04,919
France only almost three thousand that

113
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,159
came from France one of the surprising

114
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:11,099
results was at the bottom only 38 of the

115
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,260
emails that we saw actually came from a

116
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:18,060
Russian IP address which I thought that

117
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:21,030
that was pretty interesting so as far as

118
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,310
percentages of total India actually

119
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:27,059
represented more than 25% of the total

120
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:29,460
nodes that we saw Vietnam represented

121
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:33,660
about 20% of the total so just between

122
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:36,210
two of those two countries we saw 45%

123
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,660
more than 45% of the nodes coming from

124
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:41,250
just those two countries now one of the

125
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,100
other things that's interesting you can

126
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:46,320
do with this information is to see how

127
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,960
much are the IP addresses reused from

128
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,419
campaign to campaign and what we see

129
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,760
here is that the vast majority of IP

130
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:56,099
addresses you know almost 1 million of

131
00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:00,659
those IP addresses were only ever seen

132
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:02,460
in one single spam campaign and then at

133
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,979
the bottom of list we only had 3 IP

134
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,710
addresses that were seen in 30 different

135
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:10,080
campaigns there were actually zero IP

136
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:12,659
addresses that we saw in all 32 of the

137
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,669
campaigns that we extracted so this

138
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,360
means that they've got quite a large

139
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:17,219
botnet

140
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,229
doesn't it they are able to mail from

141
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,050
these IP addresses and then not reuse

142
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:24,620
them for months this causes a problem

143
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:27,120
sometimes for services like spam cop

144
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,880
spam cop when we get a spam complain

145
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,310
about an IP address we sent an

146
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,020
vacation email to let that network know

147
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,110
that they've got spam going through the

148
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:38,000
network when we see the spam go away for

149
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,160
a long period of time we tend to assume

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,770
that the administrator has cleaned up

151
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,740
the spam problem unfortunately in this

152
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:47,539
case the the criminals behind necker's

153
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,030
actually have so many BOTS that they're

154
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:53,330
able to send from them at an infrequent

155
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:55,219
enough rate to actually do some some

156
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,500
serious damage here you can see just how

157
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,450
quickly it drops off in terms of the

158
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,660
number of campaigns and the number of

159
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:05,539
IPs that were reused so as far as the

160
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:08,780
percentage of the total it was seventy

161
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:11,420
eight point six percent of the total IPS

162
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:16,280
were only ever seen in one single spam

163
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:17,930
campaign ah here are some of the IP

164
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,840
addresses that showed up most frequently

165
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,040
I went through this list to try to see

166
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,130
if there is anything interesting there

167
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,560
and of course you can find IP addresses

168
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:30,620
that probably should not be living this

169
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,960
long on the botnet so we all I think

170
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,790
need to do a better job of reading our

171
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:40,190
logs and looking for evidence of

172
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:42,440
activities such as this so besides the

173
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:45,230
sending IP addresses that are involved

174
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,850
with necker's one of the other elements

175
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:50,030
that we took a look at were the victims

176
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:53,180
you know who his knickers attacking with

177
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,650
this spam and based on all of the

178
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,050
recipients that we were able to gather

179
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,849
from the spam campaigns we noted that

180
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,970
they are primarily obtaining their email

181
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:04,940
addresses from three sources the first

182
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,620
source would be online harvesting now

183
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,420
here's an example of an email that i

184
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,060
received from necker's it was sent to

185
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,400
Equifax at well this was a tagged

186
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,680
address that I gave Equifax and it was

187
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,919
actually not part of the 2017 breach

188
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,410
this was a breach that was years ago at

189
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,240
Equifax and that address escaped into

190
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,850
the wild and this is one of the

191
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,860
addresses that necker's harvested one of

192
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,540
the other elements of harvested

193
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,060
addresses that we saw we saw lots of

194
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,740
email addresses with the number 20 at

195
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:36,949
the beginning

196
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:39,890
and of course in twenty hex is a space

197
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,750
character so this was most likely HTML

198
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,429
and coding that these guys were actually

199
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:48,050
extracting some of these email addresses

200
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:49,819
out of in addition to the harvested

201
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,609
email addresses these guys have also

202
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:56,360
been generating their own user aliases

203
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:58,940
here's an example of one MTA yov Oh

204
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,610
y-you know I've never used this address

205
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,070
ever but this is pretty typical of these

206
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,810
style addresses that you'll see necker's

207
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,820
mailing to so they're just kind of

208
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,790
generating some of these user addresses

209
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,339
and if you run catch-all for your email

210
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:16,490
like I do then these things end up into

211
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:18,680
your inbox also besides these

212
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,020
auto-generated out addresses they also

213
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,300
mail to accounts that you might

214
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:27,350
typically find at most domains things

215
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,969
like abuse at in this case things that

216
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:32,870
are like common role-based accounts

217
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:36,170
webmaster at so on what's fascinating

218
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:38,959
isn't about the last month necker's has

219
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,790
stopped mailing to the auto-generated

220
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,800
addresses and they're only mailing to

221
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,240
the harvested and the role based

222
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,880
accounts that they've got on their list

223
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,250
now and I think that this is interesting

224
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,200
because for about a year knickers had

225
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,839
not changed their mailing list at all

226
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,450
they keep mailing to the same recipients

227
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,430
over and over and over and I had to

228
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,540
wonder that if you keep mailing somebody

229
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,849
the same ransomware

230
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,770
over and over how many times they're

231
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,510
going to fall for it and I've been

232
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,370
waiting for necker's to do some sort of

233
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:10,189
maintenance to their recipient database

234
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,140
right like if you work in email

235
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,820
marketing you know that you have to

236
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,800
curate your list you're you're

237
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,660
constantly adding new names to your list

238
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,550
you're you're taking names out that

239
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,350
aren't profitable for you maybe those

240
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:23,180
names are the people that do respond get

241
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,279
put on a super-special list for you to

242
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,779
mail further in the future right you're

243
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,850
gonna hit that list extra because these

244
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:30,529
are your good customers well the people

245
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,370
behind necker's aren't interested in

246
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,829
doing any of that

247
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,450
they've been largely mailing to the same

248
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:37,279
set of addresses so it was a bit of

249
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,990
surprise earlier this month when they

250
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,570
stopped mailing to some of these auto

251
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:43,699
general

252
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,699
addresses that were clearly bogus

253
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,620
further look at some of the common

254
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:51,329
recipients indicated some some odd nurse

255
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,269
here so you can actually see here's a

256
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:56,189
list of accounts that we saw and the

257
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:58,290
number of different domains that we saw

258
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,930
with those accounts and some of these

259
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,849
are not surprising admin at info at

260
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,888
right these are going to be common

261
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:08,430
across lots of domains but what about

262
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:11,550
things like pet Gord thirty-four true W

263
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:14,519
I had never created that address ever at

264
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,599
my domain but we saw it not only mailing

265
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:17,940
to my domain

266
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,579
but we saw eighteen other domains with

267
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,170
this particular user alias as the email

268
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:24,540
address and that was strange

269
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:28,170
the same with this unity underscore

270
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:30,449
unity and a single digit I get these

271
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,829
personally at my domain and I also see

272
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:32,339
that they've been mailing to these as

273
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:35,130
well

274
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:37,019
same with doc so nine and I am just

275
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,959
sending this letter with one T in the

276
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:42,690
word letter well we looked around and

277
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:45,300
found a list this is from Project

278
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:47,610
honeypot and this is a list that they

279
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:51,120
call the list of the top 100 dictionary

280
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:56,040
attacker usernames and lo and behold on

281
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:58,889
this list we see pet gourd 34 2w and we

282
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,500
see I am sending this letter all right

283
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:03,420
so I'm not sure if this is a it's kind

284
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,819
of one of those chicken or egg problems

285
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,769
right did these names end up on this

286
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:10,529
list because necker's is mailing to them

287
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:12,480
or did necker's receive these names from

288
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:14,760
this list and start using them for their

289
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,339
mail campaigns but either way if you see

290
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:20,250
someone mailing to pet gourd 34 true w

291
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:23,910
it's probably nickers who's sending that

292
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,709
to you now the spam campaigns typically

293
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,870
come in two varieties usually there are

294
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:29,910
high volume campaigns that exist from

295
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,790
monday to friday and then there are low

296
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,260
volume campaigns that kind of run

297
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,819
continuously now there are exceptions

298
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,689
we've seen them do high volume campaigns

299
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:38,849
on weekends

300
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:41,730
but this is the type of things that they

301
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:44,850
are sending stock spam here for example

302
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:46,199
this was advertising queue SMG this was

303
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,540
one that they were hitting relatively

304
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:49,520
hard and you can actually see this was

305
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:53,329
sent on

306
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:57,319
April 12 and here's what happened to the

307
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:59,270
stock @q SMG I shot up on the day after

308
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,730
the initial run for this stock spam

309
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:04,130
campaign but if you were a long-term

310
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:06,470
investor and you were holding on to your

311
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:08,630
cue SMG hoping to extract some money

312
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:14,510
from your investment it's worth about

313
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:16,160
what 2 cents now they also do various

314
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,140
dating campaigns you might have seen

315
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,650
these that take advantage of email

316
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:24,319
accounts at Rambler dot are you they've

317
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,520
also been using accounts at GM XCOM and

318
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,550
they've been known to use other free

319
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,790
email providers in the past it was

320
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:33,740
interesting we reached out to the CTO of

321
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:36,050
Rambler because we have one of our

322
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:39,680
co-workers was a contact with his on

323
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:42,079
LinkedIn and we provided evidence of the

324
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,290
problem and what did he say to us he we

325
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:48,710
promised to block liquidate destroy and

326
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,780
send the bear on them maybe send the

327
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:53,060
bear was some kind of weird Russian

328
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:55,610
idiom that got poorly translated or

329
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:57,500
something but if you respond to these

330
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,510
campaigns if you actually send an email

331
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,550
back to the email address that they're

332
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:04,010
encouraging you to you'll get signed up

333
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:06,890
for a site like this this marmalade is

334
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:08,300
here with a with a free account that's

335
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:12,199
pretty much all they're doing it's an

336
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:14,660
affiliate based model right of course

337
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,030
Snickers is also responsible for most of

338
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,980
the email based ransomware that's going

339
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,890
around these days and this is typical of

340
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:24,110
the ransomware campaigns that they send

341
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:26,420
not very creative most of the time in

342
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,070
terms of the content although once in a

343
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,360
while you do send let's see something

344
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,070
that where they put a little bit of

345
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,740
effort into it this is a pretty well

346
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,780
done Vodafone bill or it looks like one

347
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:41,120
anyways but this one actually led to a

348
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:45,260
ransomware campaign this was a campaign

349
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,680
that got sent earlier today I have no

350
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:50,750
idea what they're doing with this

351
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,979
there's no attachment nothing this is

352
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,880
not the first time that they've made

353
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,620
mistakes when they send out their

354
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:59,370
you know they must have been out

355
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:01,500
drinking last night too and so you know

356
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,790
for example we saw it back here when

357
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,980
they were doing their pump and dump

358
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,800
stocks BAM they sent out this message

359
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:12,810
and it had no mention of the stock that

360
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:14,969
they were pumping so we've also seen

361
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:16,859
them going after cryptocurrency right

362
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,569
the price of Bitcoin had something like

363
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,329
seventeen thousand dollars yesterday so

364
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:23,310
it's obviously a top of mind for some of

365
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:25,469
these attackers as well this was an

366
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,849
email that was trying to get people to

367
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,100
click on this link and if you're

368
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:33,180
eagle-eyed you will note that the what

369
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:35,130
word my appears twice this is actually

370
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:38,099
the site that they are spoofing with

371
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:41,160
that URL it's a place to store your

372
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,720
crypto coins we'll see more evidence of

373
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:48,089
them doing similar things like that

374
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:50,910
later on they are also have their hands

375
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:53,699
in selling pills and things here's an

376
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:55,709
example of one of those messages and

377
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:58,920
this is pretty typical using the

378
00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:03,300
compromised WordPress site as a URL to

379
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:05,040
drop files or to lead the user to so

380
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,258
these are all usually compromised

381
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,719
WordPress sites or other content

382
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:11,759
management sites so there's not much

383
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,370
there that leads us back in terms of

384
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,259
attribution we did look at how much

385
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:19,290
these are reused and they tend to select

386
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:24,420
a fairly small set per campaign in terms

387
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:27,329
of reuse of URLs this is an example of

388
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,630
one of the lower volume campaigns you

389
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:33,239
can see here that this is in Italian for

390
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:36,420
some reason they have decided that this

391
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,519
particular user is Italian and so well

392
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,139
you can see every single message that

393
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,839
they've been sending me has been in the

394
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:44,279
Italian language

395
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,160
here's another necker's recipient that

396
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:49,199
they've decided must be Spanish and so

397
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,779
I'm getting the same job mail but in

398
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,310
Spanish and you can see the only

399
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:55,439
messages I get from them are in Spanish

400
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,380
to this particular account they've

401
00:16:55,439 --> 00:17:02,189
associated a language with some of the

402
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:04,169
addresses that they mail to and here is

403
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:06,109
an example of one of the same job

404
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:07,730
campaigns but this one is

405
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,829
English and this one's actually really

406
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,809
interesting because it lets us take a

407
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:15,409
stab at doing some of the attribution

408
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:18,470
right so if you notice this URL that

409
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:23,270
they are including here it's at a domain

410
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:25,549
new Bing consult top well if you do a

411
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:28,040
who is look up on that particular domain

412
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:32,270
you'll note that it is registered to who

413
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:35,720
is agent at GM XCOM now GM X again is a

414
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:38,090
free email provider but this is designed

415
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,919
to look like a who is privacy protection

416
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,379
service you know someone who's a

417
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,940
security researcher at a quick glance is

418
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,760
going to look at this domain and see

419
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:49,250
something like who is agent at GM XCOM

420
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,470
and perhaps they'll think oh there's no

421
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,419
more information for me to see here but

422
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,820
it turns out that who is agent at GM

423
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:57,740
XCOM is really the attacker controlled

424
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,559
email address and they've registered

425
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:03,260
lots of domains this particular one has

426
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,330
about 400 domains associated with it and

427
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,280
if you go to domain tools you can get a

428
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,889
nice report like this that shows you the

429
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,168
dates of the domains and when they were

430
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:14,179
registered and so on and this is

431
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:16,400
actually a pretty interesting exercise

432
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:17,960
besides being able to see what some of

433
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,419
the other domains are that they've been

434
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,980
registering you can take those dates and

435
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:23,720
you'll see you know for example a lot of

436
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:27,140
these campaigns one registered on

437
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,120
February 22nd it seemed to be about the

438
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,549
standard one-year domain registration

439
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,780
all right but if you go through some of

440
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:35,480
these some of these are a little bit

441
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:37,639
more interesting you can take some of

442
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,770
the domains and look at the ones that

443
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,750
have been registered recently and get an

444
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,910
idea you know what are the attacks that

445
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,490
these folks are conducting right now and

446
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:49,549
we can see yes these guys are very very

447
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:51,740
interested in crypto coins these are all

448
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:53,120
the sites designed to trick people into

449
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:57,830
logging in and providing their

450
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:59,780
credentials to blockchain dot info one

451
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,918
of the other sites that we saw and

452
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,600
that's why I say it was really

453
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:05,000
interesting looking at the dates of the

454
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,459
domain registrations most of the domains

455
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,470
were registered for a single year in

456
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,240
this case they actually had maintained

457
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:15,800
the domain registration for multiple

458
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,590
years on this domain PP 24 WS which

459
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,930
anyone can sign up for an account there

460
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:22,060
and it's an account for buying and

461
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:26,470
selling stolen credit card numbers with

462
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:29,950
the CVV and this is they're also doing

463
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:32,310
ssh credentials and things like that you

464
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,600
anybody can do this I actually found a

465
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:37,120
reference on reddit for that this was

466
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,209
one of the best places to buy stolen

467
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,889
credit card numbers we also get clues

468
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,120
from passive dns and this is where we

469
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,910
start to be able connect more of the

470
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,729
dots so one of the domains here the set

471
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:51,190
info conf comm caught my eye i started

472
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:53,140
looking at passive dns it turns out that

473
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,630
the IP address that was hosting that was

474
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:58,210
hosting a lot of other domains and some

475
00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:00,640
of those domains were not owned by Whois

476
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:02,530
protect or who has agent at gmx they

477
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,290
were owned by Whois protect at hotmail

478
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:07,410
are you seeing the pattern here again

479
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:10,600
this is trying to evade folks who might

480
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:12,970
want to you know might want to be doing

481
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,540
some research the names changed they're

482
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:18,490
typically a Chinese name like here we

483
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:23,470
have Wang well what was the previous one

484
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:25,780
Xing Wang Wang Wow wincing they've even

485
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:28,150
used who is agent in the past as well

486
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,530
which we saw at the GMX account so

487
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,450
pretty sure that these are the same guys

488
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:34,600
they register the same types of do

489
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:37,180
domains their operational security

490
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,709
leaves a little bit to be desired here

491
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,600
we can see where the Whois protect

492
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,430
address is actually the technical and

493
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,649
the administrative contact for a domain

494
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:46,660
but there's a whole different address as

495
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,730
the registrant and if you look at the

496
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:52,930
domains involved with that address they

497
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:55,270
are pretty bad as well so repeating this

498
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:57,280
exercise we were able to actually find a

499
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:59,889
bunch of different registering accounts

500
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,590
that belong to the attackers so this I

501
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:04,090
was looking at some of those blockchain

502
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:07,600
themed sites and I found this IP address

503
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:08,949
which belongs to Ali Baba and found a

504
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:13,230
bunch of domains that were hosted around

505
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:16,180
the same time you can see 1019 1021 1025

506
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:19,210
these all have different domain

507
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:21,370
registrants and some of these may be

508
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,740
familiar to you because if you do any

509
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,969
research into attacks these have been

510
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,610
used in some other attacks there's

511
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:31,450
actually a couple more we have

512
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:33,969
these two as well so I started looking

513
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:37,120
around here's some evidence that SEO

514
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:40,540
boss that says now I'm not cz has been

515
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,459
involved with the rig exploit kit and

516
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:46,510
you can see that that poultry is thought

517
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:49,900
gdn domain is located here Gallico lat

518
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,940
mail comm similar locky they're involved

519
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,440
with locky

520
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:58,210
there's the Whois information for that

521
00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:05,110
domain X lbs also similarly up to no

522
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:07,450
good and GM Cho 1955 you know again some

523
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:09,580
of these domains you know the the more

524
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:11,860
you look the more malicious activity

525
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:14,590
that you can uncover what was great

526
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,990
about this was they were all hosted on

527
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:19,480
the same ip around the same time we

528
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:22,270
reached out to ollie Bob McLeod and they

529
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,280
were able to tell us that a single cloud

530
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:27,309
instance was in control of that IP

531
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,799
address for the entire 10-day period at

532
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:32,049
the end of October and so what we were

533
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:34,030
able to do was essentially tie together

534
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:37,720
various different domain registrations

535
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:40,960
basically to the same group we've also

536
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,450
been able to establish the the hotmail

537
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,100
account who has protect at hotmail we

538
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,110
were able to find some information out

539
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,209
about who had been logging into that

540
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:51,850
account and it turns out that they were

541
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,419
logging in from a VPS machine and based

542
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:55,990
in Russia

543
00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:57,580
okay so attribution is hard and we're

544
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,500
gonna keep digging on this you can

545
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:02,350
probably find even more if you dig into

546
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,970
some of these addresses here but this is

547
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:07,209
the types of things that we're doing to

548
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:08,679
try to combat knickers from inside of

549
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,690
Talos so hopefully this has been

550
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:13,030
enjoyable for you I'm running near the

551
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:15,010
end of my time so I'm going to leave you

552
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,809
with a bit of my contact information if

553
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:20,030
you have any questions feel free to

554
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:26,270
reach out thank you for your time

555
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:26,270
[Applause]

556
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,970
thank you Jason are there any questions

557
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,630
yeah

558
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:04,310
hey thank you for the presentation I got

559
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:06,530
two questions first one can you share

560
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:08,330
from your experience what's the ratio

561
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:11,270
between malicious payloads and other

562
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:14,540
scams conducted by necker's second of

563
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:17,510
all it seems to be like mostly service

564
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:19,730
like all the infrastructures that you've

565
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:21,470
seen you've seen are owned by someone

566
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,150
else are some of the operations

567
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,700
belonging to the necros operators

568
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:28,730
themselves like boutique operations that

569
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:32,930
they use the network for okay you know

570
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:35,210
good questions so the ratio of malicious

571
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:39,110
content to non malicious content I would

572
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:41,900
say is somewhere probably 80/20 or 90/10

573
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,969
they've send far more malicious content

574
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,430
and I believe that's probably because

575
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,140
they make more money on ransomware than

576
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:50,480
they do on things like affiliate

577
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:52,400
campaigns where they're just sending you

578
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,030
know dating spam or trying to get people

579
00:24:52,400 --> 00:25:00,190
to buy pills or something like this and

580
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:02,000
and your other question was about the

581
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,890
infrastructure how much of that

582
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,620
infrastructure belongs to the necker's

583
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:09,200
attackers themselves well a lot of times

584
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:11,600
they're reusing stolen infrastructure

585
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,090
right they're reusing WordPress sites or

586
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,860
other content management sites but every

587
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:17,959
so often we'll see them registering

588
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,040
their own domains and that's how we were

589
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,130
able to get some of their domain

590
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:24,290
registry accounts by following back

591
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:26,510
through some of the passive DNS data

592
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:28,580
we've also been able to tie additional

593
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:30,920
domains to them I don't believe that

594
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,720
they are entirely aware when it comes to

595
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,430
things like I said like operational

596
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,470
security they're not necessarily

597
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:39,560
thinking that we have that view into the

598
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:41,330
passive DNS that we have otherwise they

599
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,550
would probably be doing a better job of

600
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:45,250
hosting things in different places they

601
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:48,139
would certainly do a better job of

602
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:50,150
making the registrations private like

603
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,490
using a real Whois privacy protection

604
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:54,680
service but it seems that you know maybe

605
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:56,090
no one's come after them seriously or

606
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,960
maybe they're in a place where no one

607
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:03,199
will and so they just maybe don't care

608
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:05,620
good question thank you Thanks we have

609
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,460
another question just don't stare

610
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:11,530
I you've mentioned that a single IP

611
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:15,790
address would be used in only one

612
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:18,280
campaign or likely have you seen how

613
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:21,670
much of ipv6 adoption have you seen in

614
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:26,860
in that case I haven't seen much out of

615
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:30,250
ipv6 yet as as a general amount that we

616
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:32,500
see we see maybe you know less than a

617
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:35,160
half a percent of the traffic that we

618
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:38,830
see coming into spam cop is sent from

619
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:41,559
ipv6 directly most people who send email

620
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:45,850
will use things like v6 to v4 gateways

621
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:48,750
and the like but occasionally we do see

622
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:51,939
a piece of mail that sent through ipv6

623
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:54,940
and that's it's on the order of you know

624
00:26:51,940 --> 00:27:00,720
less than 10 you know and in several

625
00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:03,340
months so thank you thanks for the talk

626
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,800
have you seen an accursed botnet

627
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:07,570
becoming inactive for certain periods

628
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,210
and what's the longest period you've

629
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:12,730
seen it be caught mean active yes so

630
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:14,890
about a year ago at Christmas it kind of

631
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:17,679
went silent or at least the high volume

632
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:19,929
campaigns went silent they were still

633
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,850
sending those low volume continuous

634
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:23,620
campaigns it's almost I feel like it's a

635
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:26,020
setting that they turned on and kind of

636
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,639
walk away and it just keeps going and I

637
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,320
think they're doing that to try to take

638
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,870
two different approaches right the

639
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,120
stealth approach and then the the

640
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:36,520
bombing approach but I've actually seen

641
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,770
them take breaks of up to a few months

642
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:42,639
some of the breaks have coincided with

643
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:46,240
holiday periods out of Russia Ukraine

644
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,970
area but again attribution is hard you

645
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,520
know who knows they tend to send it all

646
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:53,620
different times a day sometimes they'll

647
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,290
take a week off it definitely feels like

648
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:59,469
this is a regular business for them I

649
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:03,940
strongly suspect that after the arrests

650
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:05,950
in Russia it was in May of 2015 there

651
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,290
was some rust arrests related to the

652
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:10,300
alert banking Trojan and right after

653
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:12,670
that we saw several high profile threats

654
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:15,100
including necker's drop-off flying and

655
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:16,960
the way that it's been managed since

656
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,178
that time you know not changing the

657
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,500
recipient address is you know screwing

658
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:22,630
up and just not even putting the

659
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,400
attachment in there these are all things

660
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:26,980
that never really used to happen that

661
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,600
much and since then they have been so it

662
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,760
almost feels like the guys who went to

663
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,070
jail kind of gave their keys to the

664
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,929
botnet to maybe one of their friends who

665
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:36,310
has no clue what to do with it and

666
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:38,080
they're just trying to keep it going

667
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:41,169
right but I do feel like there's a

668
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,879
connection there simply because of some

669
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:45,300
of those activities right shutting down

670
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,640
right after the arrests and and so on

671
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:55,698
Thanks thank you Jason Thanks

672
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,699
