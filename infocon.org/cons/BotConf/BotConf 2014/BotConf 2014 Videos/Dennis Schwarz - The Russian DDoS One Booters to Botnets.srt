1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:07,220
who scary title ready

2
00:00:07,819 --> 00:00:11,750
okay we're going to talk about de los
but thats you have the floor

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,790
that could happen in timber sure a few
short stories

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,520
have the Russian Diaz 1 with you in all
to me

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,720
try to map som leaders to Barnett's a
little bit about me

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,500
my name is Dennis Schwartz and I me as a
cue researcher with Arbor networks Acer

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,029
team

8
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,630
my day-to-day most revolves around
reverse engineering our in

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,430
adding texan them to our products am
since the of detection and mitigation is

10
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,540
arbors bread-and-butter

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,839
has been a good day my time looking at
ideas Mauer

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,270
I have to disclaimers

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,320
in one political crack misstatements the
first it's never been that

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,579
as it knows the terms that Mauer and
tractor attribution

15
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:56,879
I acknowledged making wild accusations
you can vary incomplete information

16
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,120
shaky pattern matching in gut feeling
see I'm

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,530
a try to combat my confirmation bias as
much as possible

18
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,770
and make connections they make some
sense but as Adam Savage the TV show

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,179
Mythbusters like to say

20
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,920
failure to properly at 2 p.m. our and
right actors is always an option

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,009
my second its neighbors and i cant read

22
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,490
right speaker understand the the Russian
language now this is

23
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,220
obviously a fairly large weakness so I
did the best they can with Google

24
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:24,950
Translate

25
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,520
and finally when they are

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,619
label a tractor a forum abusing our

27
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,670
center as Russian I really mean is most
likely from that general area

28
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,850
i'm for the either organization I'm
rounding up to russian

29
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,149
as let's get into it a

30
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:46,850
the Russian Diaz 1 rd1 is the name that
I use

31
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:52,079
describing informal group in have three
actors that provide a dozen services on

32
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,850
the public

33
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:57,259
russian-language underground hacking
forums I'm I mean look into an arson

34
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:57,520
about

35
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,520
april is here here's a sampling of some
other forms

36
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,880
now there are many many more out there

37
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,728
and here's a sampling a summer actors

38
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:15,330
again many many more out there the RD
one day in starts

39
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,810
when a tractor decide suppose an
advertisement for Diaz in service

40
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,069
I am in the by cells there is a section
I want the many

41
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:25,510
public forums the as usual include a

42
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,819
a fancy logo banner or a more amado

43
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:33,890
short explanation what Diaz's type city
does attacks they support

44
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:39,069
racine are reputation information and
contact information

45
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:43,859
I don't have much visibility into the
customer side

46
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,600
other Rt one but some other reasons I
can think about it on my head as to why

47
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,790
someone would buy

48
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,489
the dozen services from Rt one would be
people being upset other

49
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:56,099
other players on the gaming networks now
robbery in the

50
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:00,170
in the underground lotsa forms and a
dozen services themselves

51
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,309
parties are departing targets into a
competition

52
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,739
not just in the underground burdensome
legitimate business environments

53
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,769
ransom legitimate businesses and some or
shady your business is a

54
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:17,209
Martha gambling born and I am escort
sites are targeted

55
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:20,950
and possibly diversion while carrying
out other attacks

56
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,608
in general the whole gamut

57
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:28,319
have the docs attacks are available I
would give you an idea he or

58
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,048
some as like an attack types are a
handful dads here's a pricing details

59
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:35,310
him some more ads

60
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,680
now for comparison sake I've included
the details entry from Trend Micro's are

61
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,819
Russian underground revisit research
paper shows the pricing is more or less

62
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:50,819
stayed stable throughout the years
everything in RD one is reputation-based

63
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,049
honor among the dust tractors if you
will ID dozens there is a verified by

64
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:59,000
two methods: the first is my other four
members of course

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,940
and the second is done via for Mad Men's

66
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,790
reserve a test targets there must be
taken down by the Dozen service

67
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:13,790
ads usually include vouchers up their
service from other forms as well

68
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:17,789
it's someone is wrong in a dozen
transaction

69
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:21,399
not the deals victim a course whatever
services were rendered or

70
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,580
work rendered as negotiated dispute
resolution takes place in the forums

71
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,430
performance play judge jury executioner

72
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,850
if found guilty defenders usual the
banned from the forum

73
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,590
and added to a black the section on the
form in addition

74
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:42,099
there are their contact information
handle are usually added to pastebin

75
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,160
in labeled as a scammer for Google
search posterity

76
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,610
as a

77
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,840
forum posts are the most real time
editor communications the are you one

78
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,099
three actors will that their potential
customer knows that their service

79
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:59,169
is still up an active by put in
so-called were keen

80
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:02,940
updates every few weeks or so dealer
sales threads

81
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:09,940
now besides advertising Val Jean and the
occasional dispute resolution

82
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:14,430
most the business are the only one is
done in private over ICQ

83
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:19,320
jabber and sometimes Skype as you can
imagine this makes tracking rt1

84
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,430
incredibly difficult but for the rest
this document I do just that

85
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,830
in general

86
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,820
back in infrastructure VDI last few
years and he said he's overriding

87
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,750
methods

88
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,740
proposed sites some are sold disagree 4d
das boot urs

89
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,070
it could be a script with a list a bunch
proxies

90
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,320
or could be the adidas botnet for the
rd1

91
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,080
they mostly use the ladder and I found
this out just by asking on them

92
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,500
was the more are you I do later on Rt
one use India's bonnets

93
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,449
as they're back in make things
convenient for us because I am as

94
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:58,360
present last year

95
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,409
a bucket by come by my colleagues mark
and Jason

96
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:05,530
armor is that there's a lot of ideas
bonnet tracking with herb later project

97
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,960
so you simply donor and other bits but I
pieced together

98
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,109
at and stories on Rt one that I found
interesting I first story is about

99
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,039
Stelios

100
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:20,400
and as many builders

101
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,969
%uh starting with one of his ads

102
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,590
I've highlighted the initial pivot
points these include is handle

103
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:30,109
bigger name banner ICQ jabber and
website

104
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,699
i think is better website

105
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:40,210
it. masters that CC would be good for
spirit as their dignity Blade Runner

106
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,270
a certain hours you virus tools
pasadena's in

107
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,479
in so many other open source I am source
is out there

108
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,750
but this internet

109
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,889
any deal as an hour or a botnet all the
edges

110
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,940
in a bit CloudFlare and that's kind
where Liz visibility

111
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,460
I move into

112
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,508
the other periods there is even more and
more these identities

113
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:07,009
the most important takeaways here are
the Maver based handles

114
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:14,009
in blue and the two new booty web sites
in red I look in the first period site

115
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,610
dedust service .cc again

116
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:22,340
no details Mauer the second one though

117
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,250
deal are service .ws I got there
generally does but

118
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,759
so is a step in the right direction but
Blade Runner doesn't contain any attack

119
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,530
data for this particular c2 so

120
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,859
not much to explore I just a quick
aside:

121
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,020
um I use a number Montego graphs in my
talk but I'm

122
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,469
painfully aware how terribly much you
can shop in presentation slides

123
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:48,020
they just want to ended the general I'll
outline I use

124
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,630
c2 domains it up the IP's that the
awesome our family are the red spiky

125
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,530
things and

126
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,198
c2 path names at the bottom the

127
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,150
the a domain eye peas in the grass are
important where the more less glossed

128
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,370
over during the actual talk

129
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,490
but please don't hesitate to reach out
to me afterwards if you're and is in the

130
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,680
details

131
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,020
way back to it bacteria for dr. serviced
at WS

132
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,270
get me another identity engine X in with
that

133
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:21,919
a couple more domains to dress de dos
use lucky

134
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,480
get me another dirt jumper a but still
no attack Tatum

135
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,500
anti-dust service dotnet house

136
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:37,500
again the result any did awesome our
before moving on is one do you

137
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:43,429
know a pattern Dr service that still use
users with some %uh visit your domains

138
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:46,579
it seems that he has since moved away
from this pattern was leaders

139
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,060
incarnation which was ID masters that's
easy

140
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,949
as Stelios

141
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,160
is well known in the RD one has been a
scammer in a ripper

142
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,829
those upset a lot of folks his I did
he's keeping blacklisted and his

143
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,770
reported real-life details have been
leaked all over the forms and paceman

144
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,990
summers leaked material has helped to
corroborate my pivots

145
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,350
but most the new info was here say they
can really link inner

146
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,570
or verify I'm one post

147
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,630
stuck out to me though as associate
specific IP addresses to still use

148
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:28,500
tracing these down it turns out that the
IP labeled as

149
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,850
Stelios is botnet does indeed link to a
botnet

150
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,780
a a madness de dos botnet I'm wailing
this

151
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,189
opera botnet after the two domains it is
associated with

152
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,360
and as a reference in a few times later

153
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,500
the time writing i three to four a/c to
use

154
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,520
were active with different versions love
the man has been already know them

155
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,980
upper but net itself has been active all
year

156
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,390
with %uh 509 a distinct attack targets

157
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,939
here's a graph

158
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:10,650
visit a bit attack activity and a good
idea

159
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,390
what the body has been attacking
recently here are october's target

160
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,069
domains

161
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:21,090
interest me one other targets is

162
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,840
it. masters that CC so maybe this isn't
stories about it after all because why

163
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,000
would he attacked his own

164
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,190
new website I suppose it could have been
him disraeli a test or something but for

165
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,690
now

166
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,820
I've leave it open ended whether opera
is really his Barnett

167
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:41,480
or somebody else's continuing on I

168
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,510
picked up the search on the other end
and so with no indeed awesome our CTU

169
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,660
Stelios Maver doubt are you seems like a

170
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:55,660
I'm reasonable Association here I think
they've been in there another do jumper

171
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,950
this time the drive variant and also in
the the adidas by

172
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:06,050
Blade Runner has logs for the Athena
sorry things

173
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,449
know that differ few months in late 2013
here the target remains the rest

174
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:17,640
the 41 were just IP's and here

175
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,620
is its attack activity

176
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,980
there enough as it is. Maver

177
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,510
are you end up leading to a large
cluster be awesome our

178
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,990
and botnets after looking into it more
though

179
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,410
I'm on the fence as to how much if it
all his associate with Stelios

180
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,410
are turned more the cluster later but
for now

181
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,339
a section of high here contains four
domains they all begin with

182
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:46,410
legal team Anna and the lead to a ferret

183
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,560
NG but the hot spots this is convenient
because legal D

184
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,859
the Rt one thread after is a subject to
my next story

185
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,060
legal D

186
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,890
dedust esquire the Odeon

187
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:04,689
are you want reactor that had been run
in the legal Diaz better for a number of

188
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,350
years

189
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:10,269
in addition to running a puter he I'm

190
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:14,070
is also the seller and possibly crater
other Paradise City does but

191
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:18,440
me after that and again

192
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,760
looking through no indeed awesome our C
2's paradise test

193
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,620
are you stood out to me is a a likely
candidate for the coder slash seller

194
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:32,620
a paradise here's that infrastructure
while not even if it's probably a bit

195
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,709
difficult to read the

196
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:38,329
two parts I found most interesting were
I there are 40 on our families

197
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:41,849
paradise of course armageddon eclipse

198
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,110
and ferret I'll ask you personal
connections as a back cheaper

199
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,670
research those but some blog about them
and the second inhibit is the spelling

200
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,130
on

201
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:55,560
c2 domain the telly and c2 leads to you
armageddon

202
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:02,560
an eclipse spots I'm this is interesting
because a post in August the 2013

203
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:06,760
were legal D was arguing a defamation
case in front of a jury of his former

204
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,399
peers

205
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,550
resume its the following nice accused
the pits essentially a top one boils

206
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,069
down to someone named Kelly on

207
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,730
was calling legal the a scammer for
selling him a broken but

208
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,680
I'll deal the respond with him and I say
observers say about domain

209
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,149
in the bot it's not my fault they are
trying to access the panel in the wrong

210
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:24,920
directory

211
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,069
he continues though to make amends
though

212
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:31,510
everything's are our reputation based
I'll say up with another by

213
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,310
one they just were on the sale in the
end

214
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,609
round in this aligns nicely with are
getting an eclipse because

215
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,110
eclipse I just started appearing in the
wild right around August 2013

216
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,560
further down in the logs allies
troubleshooting

217
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,650
with de Leon he actually is paste the
URL that contains tell yon

218
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:52,209
for this little find the link that the
Paradise test RU infrastructure

219
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:59,210
is part of the goodies before time if
you the all the pieces together

220
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,490
I need to it interviews in there Rt one
after Ross costar

221
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,560
or RGD a really quick

222
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,640
here's mine is ads in October Anthony
his contact details

223
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,520
now

224
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,250
I want to mention ross cost us because a
few museums ahead on legal DNS

225
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,080
infrastructure

226
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,250
others also ties back to you that still
has mattered

227
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,180
are you cluster I use the segue into the
story

228
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,279
my first thought was that there seems to
be a lot of association with

229
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,460
are you one Brit actor names and legal D
c2 domains

230
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:41,060
second they rely adidas families
represented in his infrastructure

231
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:45,109
know why would he need so many different
for is one bidder you imagine one family

232
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,380
with is more likely than

233
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:52,570
19-7 families and a and thirties left a
few clues here in there that he escaped

234
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,580
the capabilities

235
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,740
and the skill set to be hosting provider
so the three things

236
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,560
lead me to believe that legally provides
the awesome our hosting services did are

237
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,140
you one

238
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:08,140
along with his Beer in paradise by not
continuing on here is more that Stelios

239
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,400
Maver

240
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,890
are you cluster I am I did run into a
few issues with it though

241
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:19,030
first besides legal the domain name mean
I haven't been able to directly link

242
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,949
this part infrastructure to legal these
paradise test

243
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,850
that in for are you infrastructure and
at the time Arabian

244
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:30,390
most other domains were resolving or
resolving the domain parking IP's

245
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:35,209
labor as a few historic logs

246
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:39,469
from one the fair but in the
infrastructure he was briefly actor for

247
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,240
a couple months

248
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,880
in early 2014 with only six target
domains

249
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,970
and at the time writing Onia

250
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,550
three domains in a entire infrastructure
are still active and they're all

251
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,510
resolving to the same IP

252
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:59,150
12 main points to a basic download about
the panel called K but

253
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:03,630
and the other two domains legal deed are
you in Santa Fe's that are you

254
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:10,630
they point to a Debye de dos Barnett now
the G but has been fairly active since

255
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,500
July 2014

256
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:19,290
with 246 distant targets here's its
activity

257
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:24,670
attack activity and

258
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:31,670
star simply no vas october's targets and
the legal deed are you two main

259
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:37,480
I've been active was troubling to me
because a I'm another open-ended

260
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,670
question as to whether

261
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,000
how much for that story is Maher base
infrastructure is the goodies

262
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,840
if it is indeed his at all I see in late
2013

263
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,420
legal the a closed out most is better
sales threads

264
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,520
and said that he was leaving the
underground to work for a missouri-based

265
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,970
hosting slash the dust mitigation

266
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,930
a provider that specializes in
legitimate high yield investment

267
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:00,640
programs

268
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:07,639
a program sites and he hasn't backed the
Mac and the forms since

269
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,529
next up is are you one actor are you are
due

270
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:16,049
they advertise as a team so there might
be more tow tractors behind the scenes

271
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:18,230
but my feeling is as just one actor

272
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:23,770
the aren't politically active in are you
1 forums

273
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,250
but some other ICQ transits showed up in
that previously mentioned

274
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:32,940
Stelios blacklist in so there is some
connection they have a puter

275
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,580
service of course and

276
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,520
this is it infrastructure the deals from
our choice year is called

277
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:48,679
I a but I about is their own proprietary
de da spot

278
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:52,409
ivins it used also they're better
infrastructure I'm

279
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:55,720
the fairly standard he does but some
acting in the details on it there's a

280
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,470
few slides

281
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,450
on the web from another shop I did in I
know if you're the researchers have

282
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,350
their notes on their

283
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:07,350
there on the Internet via but here the
later stats for I about with a small

284
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:09,039
caveat

285
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:14,070
with a small number of attacks between
August 2013 in June 2014

286
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,178
initially I thought that the about
midday died out in June

287
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:23,029
but turns out they just are blocking our
access I've since fixed that bug

288
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:26,990
and I'm and the botnet remains active
the time right I just don't have

289
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:33,500
complete attack details here's a
sampling

290
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,220
are the targets I do have there too
familiar faces analyst

291
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,600
still uses deal are service .cc and it.
masters that CC

292
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,949
well rigidly research in I about

293
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,350
and in our yard you I still upon a chat
functionally

294
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:54,428
on their bitter side and had the
opportunity impromptu interview with

295
00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:54,940
them

296
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,950
here's a misnomer its I found
interesting what is i mean

297
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,909
are you are do how long have you been
active for a couple years

298
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:07,029
I'm how they distribute I about they get
really vague answer here but

299
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:11,190
the did city don't use exploits I'm
taken as exploit kits because they're

300
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,250
too expensive

301
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:17,309
and finally had to be launder their de
dos revenue and they do it too

302
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:19,920
a gaming currencies

303
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,850
I'm all about big point but they said
they don't use between

304
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,929
obviously wasn't popular in Russia I
don't know how true that is

305
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:32,160
nowadays but also a map in a better
infrastructure

306
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,520
I came to stop by Melissa rebranded
better service called

307
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,790
overload labs I haven't Ron

308
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,760
I mean seen any advertisements for this
service on our team owner I'm Google or

309
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:49,760
anywhere so I'm actually not sure if
it's it was launched or not are moving

310
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,170
on to Storm Team

311
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:58,020
or esteem I'm they also advertise as a
team but it's likely just one thread

312
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,540
thread actor named Huntsman

313
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,370
here's my other ads from January

314
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:08,709
the a number a bitter sites

315
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,200
including various domain starting with
dr. service

316
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,790
if you remember I am Stelios had a
number di da service remains as well

317
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:21,100
so the same name in overlap here I'm at
this time I don't believe there is any

318
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,580
overlap in the two actors

319
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,010
but considering Stelios history mod why
denny's

320
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:31,590
I'm not really now I'm along with jabber
nyse: you have a fairly active

321
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:37,659
Twitter account as well map into your
domains

322
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,270
they don't need any Diaz Mauer
furthermore

323
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,050
reading the post associated with I
esteem

324
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,540
add it easy to see that the Rt one is
not a fan of them and they've been

325
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,950
blacklisted in docs

326
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:57,480
accordingly for being a scammer the most
interesting Pisa evidence

327
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,530
to me in this blacklisting was a nice if
you can skip between Storm Team

328
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:06,270
and in RD one tractor known as grab-bag
other ICQ conversation

329
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,440
happen on June 12th 2014

330
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,760
in what looks like an axle pay in an
accident

331
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,650
%uh Storm Team pace 3d dos target orders

332
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,750
to grab bag crabbing even at its in his
post that

333
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:27,270
Storm Team stupidly pace in in his Dr's
orders

334
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,750
this accident on pace was very helpful
because from June 12th

335
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:36,660
June 21st Blaber log attacks on one of
those targets from 15 distinct c2

336
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,370
domains

337
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,939
here's a multi go about

338
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:48,940
infrastructure now the highlights here
that all is the team's lead to do jumper

339
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,189
drives

340
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,760
in addition some really good I P sharing
among the 16 IP's

341
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,990
in some good patterns in the c2 URL file
names as you can see here

342
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:05,990
taken all is one logical botnet has been
very very active all year

343
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,860
with with a little more than 1500
distinct targets

344
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,929
this the attack

345
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:20,930
activity the most active c2 in the bunch
and it had a

346
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:28,260
142 distant targets in October alone
here are some other domains

347
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:34,269
now my neck stories about chef and a
stroll in

348
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:38,510
here this ad from 2013

349
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:45,510
but it has recent work in posts and
contact information

350
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:53,789
I'm just advertise at least five better
web sites over the years

351
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:58,090
and they all seem a bit familiar in
coincidental Tom

352
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,370
I don't believe there's any overlap chef
and these two other directors i've

353
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,379
mentioned previously

354
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,529
I just think he's drawing are you one
and drilling security researchers

355
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:11,139
tracing down a beer sides

356
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:17,809
lead me to a dead end though I'm digging
through ships most

357
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:22,110
I thought I had some upon a good lead
with in August 2013 vouch

358
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:26,539
for the fair Diaz by I but I haven't
been able to weed out

359
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:29,720
a possible candidate from the fair it's
easy to use known to me

360
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,000
so at this time just he does but is
still an open question

361
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,070
I

362
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:42,120
my second last story Xonar d1 tractor
known as copyleft

363
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,389
here's an ad from 2013

364
00:23:47,389 --> 00:23:51,870
with our current working posts there's
actually a lot of positive feedback from

365
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,178
satisfied customers in this particular
thread

366
00:23:54,179 --> 00:24:01,179
here is his contact details

367
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:06,869
a my first bought it for him was on some
ICQ logs

368
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:10,609
there were leaks where he was trying to
purchase an after my dr's Barnett Bakken

369
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:11,668
2012

370
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:16,580
despite having easy to your all four in
the logs I contract this one down in the

371
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,439
wild at all

372
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,379
next

373
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:24,389
giving up his email address got me a
hand for domains

374
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:31,389
and as you can see here kinda took off
from there on their number details Mauer

375
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,199
families

376
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,269
involved here something to break them
down into sections

377
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:39,519
starting with the single instance

378
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,850
paradise neutrino anything about nets
are

379
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:47,139
yet the about nets they're all LinkedIn
by some solid IP sharing with more

380
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:50,529
with them is more prolific but nets
which I'll talk about next

381
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:54,779
nyse: paradise was active around may end
unit 2013

382
00:24:54,779 --> 00:25:00,190
persons gone away I'm as is Athena was
really active around October 2013

383
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,830
and his neutrino was foreseen around
July of this year

384
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:08,379
unfortunately I don't have any Blade
Runner a log surgery in these

385
00:25:08,379 --> 00:25:13,119
next

386
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,988
the black Rev Diaz botnet another
personal connection for me

387
00:25:16,989 --> 00:25:21,759
a this link makes a lotta sense because
when a black river's been advertised in

388
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:22,419
the forms

389
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:27,249
back in 2013 copyleft was listed as an
authorized seller

390
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:31,309
now unfortunately all the old black Rev
advertisements have

391
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:34,428
have been taken down and removed from
Google or expired from Google

392
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:41,159
so I don't have a visual that now for
Prosperity here are the historical later

393
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:41,799
stats

394
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:46,179
from popular spycraft Barnett nyse:
actor for a few months

395
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:49,230
in mid-2013 with the forty-three

396
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:53,980
distinct targets no here's some of the

397
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,840
attack targets from then

398
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,879
nynex is a good sized ferret but net

399
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:08,430
the connection to ferret also makes a
lotta sense

400
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:12,520
because on the only public ferret sales
for that I'm aware of

401
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:19,520
here he gets praise is at the bottom
paraphrasing a day he goes on to say

402
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,390
that

403
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:24,380
several times the changes to the by
itself is going on with one day

404
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,820
turnaround service from

405
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,110
from the code from there it's colder we
can kinda see that version. progression

406
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:35,530
intimacy to path names are so she was
happy left in addition there some

407
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:42,530
some goods ET phoning patterns as well
obligor has a log many attacks in the

408
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,020
fares i things though

409
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,520
Oni 14 testing target domains for a few
days

410
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,170
in August the 2014 here

411
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:59,170
your those targets onto the menace but
net

412
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:04,900
this segment was a

413
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,760
actor from October 2013 to March 2014

414
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:15,760
with 40 distinct attack targets matures
active even most recent are most active

415
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,460
c2

416
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:22,580
and here's a

417
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:28,470
target sampling

418
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,020
last but not least

419
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:37,020
is the very large during jeopardy drive
botnet nom it's been active since at

420
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:38,520
least

421
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,760
June 2013 in Labour's Lord close to

422
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:48,760
1700 distinct thirty domains here's the
attack activity from the most active CT

423
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,210
when a bunch

424
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,580
and

425
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,919
there is a 52 thing targets in October
and here's a sampling of those targets

426
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:05,840
a couple quick pattern notes

427
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,649
and I'm just because are just not all a
copula stirred Mb drive

428
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,780
a CD path names contain a slash DRV

429
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:17,560
and from some of his earlier domains
contains the left which seems unlikely

430
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,830
abbreviation

431
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:25,830
his hand on my last are you want stories
about crabby crab cake

432
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:29,940
there's been a few references this after
my talk so far

433
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,670
the first one was what I was talking
about sellers blacklist in crab leg was

434
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,580
the person who

435
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,840
who lied to his suppose that IP
addresses that led to that

436
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,939
opera manaus barnett's and the second
reference was there the story about

437
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,800
Storm Team

438
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,280
were %uh Storm Team actually placed him
by summits their de dos targets

439
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,410
during their blacklist in looking in a
crab eggs the more he really

440
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:54,620
enjoys a black was in process when he
gets involved

441
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,500
is evidence tends to be fairly thorough
now has been for a thorough enough to

442
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,210
link a few

443
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:06,180
by reporters about nets including his
now here's what I've

444
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,590
a crags ads most is add their old this
one from 2012

445
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:17,590
but the sales reps have current working
posts his contact details in stable

446
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:22,970
throughout the years as well

447
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,550
not giving up a a crab eggs

448
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,600
Stelios blacklist imposed on September
24th 2013

449
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,439
I search Blade Runner for any attacks
and I to II PZ least

450
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,830
I'm sure enough on September 24th labor
log attacks against

451
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:42,770
both those IP's from 1c to you net CT
was key robbed at be get

452
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:47,670
that are you in addition to the attack
targeted c2 domain name is eerily

453
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,900
similar to grab bag

454
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,950
my was able to associate

455
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:55,840
many dealers in assets this botnet
besides the the Wonder jumper here

456
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,709
bills fairly active from May 2013

457
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:06,000
to October 2013 with 119 distinct thirty
domains

458
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,630
here's that actor art activity

459
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,950
and for posterity hear some of those

460
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:20,920
some those targets

461
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,710
now digging through more a crab legs
black listening posts

462
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:27,370
I came across one for someone name San
wells a

463
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:30,949
again credit post thorough ICQ logs as
evidence

464
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:34,010
this time as a reference to attack on
august 10th

465
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,740
2014 a domain that starts with C and
Wells

466
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,540
the estimate was was centered in the
paste not giving off that

467
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:45,149
in Blade Runner got me attack on San
wells .ws

468
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:49,070
on August 10 2014 from three C 2's

469
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:55,870
here they are now those first to see to
use legal deed are you in Santa Fe's

470
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,469
there are you

471
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:01,210
look a bit familiar though lemme and
they are

472
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,040
their q3 actor domains I mention in the
gaudy story

473
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,110
these were the ones that confuse me is
to why there is still active after legal

474
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,360
deets oppose the lefty

475
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,219
the Rt one and then and when the restive
as infrastructure died out

476
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,520
nyse: seems at least that part was not
the goodies

477
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:23,639
in more likely crab eggs not shown the
benefits

478
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,710
are attacks for legal D in Santa Fe's
already

479
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:30,730
so these are the benefits that third
seed you compromised desk Afghans that

480
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,350
are you

481
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:35,899
here we get a couple murder tempers and
also a Pandora de dos but

482
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,890
takin

483
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,510
that all is one logical botnet here the
Lakers dats

484
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:47,350
fairly active with 767 distant targets
or gonna

485
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:51,330
over the last year here's

486
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:58,240
thats attacked your attack activity and
forty eight distinct targets

487
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,080
in in October

488
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,269
and with that that's weimaraner the
Russian the last one where try to maps

489
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:06,510
and pictures about nets

490
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:11,879
as you probably have noticed my approach
is very passive relying on a lot of luck

491
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,730
shaky pattern matching and got feelings
to combat might the incomplete

492
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,399
information

493
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,709
but they mention again in I try to make
connections at least make some sense to

494
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,080
me

495
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,220
I'm at times it's been extremely
difficult and frustrating to make some

496
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,220
of those connections

497
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:29,289
going forward I do a few ideas but using
more active numeration techniques

498
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:32,750
things like dr. tony Potts and known
target domains

499
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:37,039
to help trace back to ninety-one tractor
enough but that of course comes with its

500
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:37,990
own set of risks

501
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:42,090
and challenges so was the how and if
that pans out

502
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:46,189
you know I hope we saw the missing
connections I did in

503
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:53,190
enjoy the stories thanks much listenin

504
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,720
thing at some time a surprising
questions one or

505
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:05,720
to questions good

506
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,899
one to three
