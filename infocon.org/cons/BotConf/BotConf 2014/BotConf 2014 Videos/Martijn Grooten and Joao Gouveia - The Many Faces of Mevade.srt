1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,040
a kid it looks like we're ready so

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,210
the much time and the drawl no

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,929
is with well pronounced yet young for
gay the

4
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:15,309
were a nice enough to propose a
presentations on the

5
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:19,119
in prison presentation on my father how
to pronounce it

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,180
and it's a good question her sexy

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,779
the players about that I'm so you have
the floor

8
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:30,099
thank you thank you very much so rabies
is your way

9
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:34,600
I'm with his network's margin is with
the Virus Bulletin

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,260
know when the what we think it was an
interesting work around

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,550
miss out which we are going to tell you
the story about

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,309
what it is and what we saw so

13
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:53,309
the just as an intuition because the

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:24,560
them

15
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,760
is a better if I offended a yep

16
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,450
and we can security software

17
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,540
but it's a anti-virus anti-spam we
organize annual security conference we

18
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,810
were in Seattle a

19
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,250
two months ago and will be in prague a
next year and we also

20
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,080
published technical articles including
summer with them by people in this room

21
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,630
which is

22
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,660
goood you have something impressing on
the right about

23
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:55,070
beckel let you know were actually hiring
at the moment

24
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:00,070
juror the job this one okay

25
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:06,389
so am the a last week on preparing for a
presentation and I realize that I don't

26
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,020
really know

27
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,549
how these more it's pronounced I was
call it my father

28
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,610
for some reason but it may as well be be

29
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,480
me they'd and one of his Twitter some
russian guy actually told me it might be

30
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,590
a move it. because the

31
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,100
it may well be russian the sorry I i did
i I'll call it my father

32
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,690
but a it may well be me they'd and

33
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,769
some people actually signed bronze
combat call at seven its and

34
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:35,320
also made as BC's use so

35
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,769
a.m. the goal of this presentation is is
twofold the

36
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:42,080
on one hand we just want to tell the
story of

37
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,040
I'll Nevada botnet but on the other hand
we want to tell our story of

38
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,340
fighting this botnet chasing his partner
and the

39
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,560
going to show you that to chase botnet
you don't

40
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,660
meet to start with a more sample there
are different ways to do that

41
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,769
at the depth that interesting for people
in from

42
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:03,860
so a.m.

43
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,390
last week everyone was talking about the
right in which is is very

44
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,320
big scary ball where it

45
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,100
and as a sq problem written

46
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,040
Belcourt people who who noted talking
about call it the most advanced more

47
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,780
ever detected

48
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,550
compared to this halifa before the mall
where

49
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:27,560
bodies really a tiny mouse its it's not
very advanced its it's nothing that

50
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,830
many people in his room probably have to
worry about because if you

51
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,070
practice general security hygiene and
have a

52
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,890
working at the Varsity problem have to
worry about it on the other hand if you

53
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,350
look at the number of infections

54
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:43,579
dan Nevada enormous mouse because there
are

55
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,030
million infections whereas wretched is a

56
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,470
is a tiny elephant because the really
only a few

57
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,720
targets we don't know to more but still
they're not gonna be more than a few

58
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,080
hundred

59
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,340
I guess so Nevada first

60
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,340
started to appear on the scene about
three years ago

61
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,390
I think the first public book both
dedicated to it was

62
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,738
from Microsoft who in generated

63
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:12,450
well added the packaged with Mike
Malicious Software Removal Tool

64
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,480
at the court said in its and

65
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,690
a they wrote that it's this Trojan
Family

66
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,840
moderates redirects about traffic from
search engines like Google

67
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,979
Yahoo and even big an

68
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:32,409
this report makes it but too bad
admitted more it

69
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,300
as more goatee is relatively harmless
and as a relatively because it is

70
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,030
harmful but

71
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,200
doesn't steal your bank details or

72
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,520
haha equipped your your heart

73
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,010
am after this big to be quiet throughout
Nevada was

74
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,060
not much news doesn't mean no one was
affecting it or looking at it back

75
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,880
it is wasn't very interesting and and
it's good to know that a lot more out

76
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,330
there

77
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,539
not many people are looking at a moment
people are writing about it

78
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,210
as also what if you read the newspaper
be more like to read

79
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,310
security security news you more like to
read the

80
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,820
stories about them technically
interesting piece

81
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,990
more rather than the ones that are very
prevalent and then suddenly

82
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:21,560
something interesting happened in
September last year want to talk project

83
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,220
y'all know what stories reporter a sharp
increase

84
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:30,570
in the number of connections from
everything complete and

85
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,030
well as a sharp increase I mean that in
ten or eleven days

86
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,219
the number of connections increase by a

87
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,100
multiplied by fact of life something
which is it enormous made it was

88
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,260
3 moms after at Snowden had come out

89
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,960
which is woods and is a leaks

90
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,099
the team the unlikely that this was the
case even though some

91
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,240
door used a very excited that they find
people using poor

92
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,970
did was very likely but is what was
enormous

93
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:05,520
and then and it was was one interesting
thing because i sat

94
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,560
but every country in the world so more
connected to network there was one

95
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,820
notable exception and

96
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,610
this is was a divine ok to this on their

97
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,150
authority may limit roger is one of the
people behind

98
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,460
or and he wrote I'm compelled to point
out that

99
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,609
this table has one data point that will
keep the bellies of conspiracy theorist

100
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,620
for four months only in only country did
in game was Israel

101
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,130
and it's actually in procedural we'll
see while 8102 people

102
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:38,240
israeli a and yeah so am

103
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,270
what was happening well your complaints
by

104
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,229
guy from results box I T in them I know
since spicer

105
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:48,400
over here seeded with the credit ima

106
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,739
greatly a.m. he he was the one who
discovered what what

107
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,630
because of this outdoor network increase
and it was a lot but not

108
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,810
and effective was its particular but
that was Nevada

109
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,960
which separates at the door components
and and which

110
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,359
weekend but find out what extremely back
wasn't the first botnet

111
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,320
but you store for mama control
communication which I think golan

112
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,460
understand why it makes sense for Obama
to do that

113
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,909
but it was the first one that by doing
so really

114
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,180
skew the door statistics hand

115
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,880
he also found some Mon control services
which

116
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,490
also shows wire what people want as BC

117
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,740
okay to having having said that have
been a set the scene about them a father

118
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,920
Joe I was gonna

119
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,330
gonna talk about that about stuff the

120
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,380
he does and they do which ultimately
lead to

121
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:46,219
to order artist so

122
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,710
the cordial

123
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,270
showing it didn't buy it is an me with
just to explain to beat

124
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,450
of what we do in the way we do things
because it connects deeply

125
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,940
to how we conduct our research me in
marching on the fates of

126
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,560
a so we developed the Philly

127
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,980
recent call concept around looking at

128
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,760
security fence as as a sort of big data

129
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,120
a and 10 try to come up with the
technology that the Los processing all

130
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,700
these

131
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,719
events that are happening in real time
in large-scale

132
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,780
in order to extract valuable threat
indicators

133
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,659
so know too that we working on two main
pieces

134
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:33,320
the one that you see on their on the
left side

135
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,039
is of course a right of the formation of

136
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,750
a sort of information that we we collect
a

137
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,099
I mean we have pretty much the bit of
everything from

138
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,980
sinkholes from body parts from traps
everything that you can

139
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,339
think about that houses where wesat
else's Morales's

140
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:55,460
the whole idea was to collect all this
information

141
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,180
as much as we can and push it as events

142
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,689
as things are start happening into a
high-performance complex event

143
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,940
processing debt we build

144
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,880
so that then we can use that together
with an API

145
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,220
to extract value information from from
the Dayton

146
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,910
and provided to subscribers and is in a
nutshell

147
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,640
its initially what we did then of course
you have on the right side

148
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,050
different ways to access the data the
API which is by far the most interesting

149
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:25,620
thing

150
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,880
probably for for for you guys or any
researcher

151
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,130
but also dashboards connectors and stuff
like that

152
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,970
but really the central piece is the even
processor

153
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:43,220
and the flexibility of GPS so in a
nutshell it's really all about streaming

154
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,649
so the its different calls the because
position we are used to looking at

155
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:51,139
databases and that's not about

156
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,959
it's not what you doing here we just
collecting events and making them

157
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:55,758
available

158
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:00,980
as industry in streaming and so we built
this competitive process

159
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,779
it's really foale's publish/subscribe a
model

160
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:08,240
it's really easy to publish date and to
into

161
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,579
get it out all tall to fit its official
rest

162
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:16,120
and the all the event tonight Jason
serbia it's really really easy to use

163
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,310
being a competent processor the

164
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,060
idea was okay at not what I want to
access the dayton but I want to do

165
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,060
something we did

166
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,109
in real time I want to be able to
correlate I want to be able to measure

167
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,040
I want to be able to I don't think about
it as well of stuff that

168
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,629
as researchers we want to do on top of
Dayton

169
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:39,769
and the idea was to make that available
in real time on GPS

170
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:42,860
so there are a lot of possibilities in
terms of post-processing

171
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,639
which leads to the

172
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,410
one important thing so one of the
sources of information is that we have

173
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,120
is a fair Larson calling infrastructure

174
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,959
which uses besides with this technology
that there was mentioning

175
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,430
as a way to get Dayton about

176
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,109
what we want to sing colin White and

177
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,569
is initially to do that we have to use a
sort of

178
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:14,860
array of sensors around the world I
don't like the the words answer because

179
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,129
normally has sort over negative notation
with

180
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:22,279
it's really worries its a we r
collecting information from

181
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:25,279
several countries them

182
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,410
is initially it it can be other things
as well but nowadays we focus a lot on

183
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,199
on DNS into and HTTP it's by far the

184
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:38,279
the type of protocols that gives the
givers more

185
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:42,790
more reach information that we can use
to extract straight indicators

186
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,449
and like I said so this collective and
eyes push towards the complex even

187
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,240
processor

188
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,020
dates available to researchers and their
tools to

189
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,230
work today to and find in fact that that
that was the

190
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,880
mingle and or to finance the or

191
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,660
in this case things that we want to
single the

192
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,780
we of course is the PI and then we'll
look at it at things like don't like the

193
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,640
ones mentioned you

194
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,880
so we look at space Pacific traffic
patterns

195
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,550
we look at the man rotation volume at
six frequency

196
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,589
and and it ultimately what these

197
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:22,680
allows is to detect what I looked like
to call

198
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,689
a new clothes performing sees since its
inception

199
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:30,090
which typically leads to normal the new
botnet

200
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:34,030
which can be new book yet from old mall
where you mall where

201
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,240
its do the detection of these new
clothes the forming

202
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,880
that allows us to to be fairly quick

203
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,590
yeltsin calling you stuff but of course
detecting DG's as well

204
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:49,540
a like like these two examples

205
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,780
just two examples of disease easy to
detect using

206
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,030
this methodology and I'm not

207
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:00,410
not going very much detail about these
because tomorrow there is going to be

208
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:00,860
another

209
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,280
know that talk by peers Camille which is
one of my colleagues

210
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,589
he's going to explain in detail

211
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:12,020
with his part what we are doing on on
these parks in terms of

212
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,980
of research the end result is also is
always okay let's

213
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,380
this is a bad what net lets you call it
and see how it looks

214
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,780
just some number so that you get you
have an idea

215
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,600
it's very loud large I don't know it's
it's

216
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,990
it's difficult to compare with others
because there aren't many numbers out

217
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,720
there about

218
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,730
colleague operations ours usually we
trek around

219
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,740
a seven million infected devices over a
24-hour

220
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,920
time window which uses a lot and

221
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,959
and is of course generates a a lot of
traffic

222
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,230
and we make that traffic available as
events

223
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,819
so it means that you you can actually
see what's

224
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:57,309
going on with that with the with the
fact that device when it's checking in

225
00:13:57,309 --> 00:14:02,509
with my control or is dropping some for
information it's not the information

226
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:07,339
I put their number six thousand but in
reality sometimes its 10,000 15,000

227
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:11,660
really varies with a lot a lot of the
events happening per second on these

228
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,079
on this projection and of course we
trekked we track

229
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:18,169
a lot of power families using these

230
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:22,639
method being one of them of course

231
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,269
and and I was playing how we detect you
but that's using these methodologies

232
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:30,759
home if it was the indeed the a good
example

233
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,100
that is a an interesting picture because

234
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,149
sometimes it's really hard to explain to

235
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:41,169
less technical people who old is about
the

236
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:45,809
sort of living organism botnet art so it
is a good picture about

237
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:49,600
home if it looked when we first detected

238
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,639
so you have the the common controls are
the

239
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,919
the reddish balls and the rest are
effective missions

240
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:00,629
so what we saw you know first

241
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:04,139
so basically what we thought was a

242
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,939
a bunch of prayers and NX means not nor
is over

243
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:11,549
more resolve Aquarius to fix set of 21

244
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:17,299
dot issue domains and they very much
consistent with what you would expect

245
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:17,869
from

246
00:15:17,869 --> 00:15:21,209
an automated behavior you have to have a
certain frequency

247
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:24,559
certain people see that lead you to
believe that is a

248
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,139
an automated beacon we will see multiple
jugar geographies

249
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:34,369
of course and the injury interesting
indicator was that we we

250
00:15:34,369 --> 00:15:38,329
I will be we have a pretty good
knowledge of the botnet space

251
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:42,789
know there's but if you look at these IP
address and compare it with our

252
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:43,419
knowledge

253
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:47,309
the overlap was really minimal which
means OK these

254
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:52,219
something you going on so up to this
point support the decision is okay let's

255
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,509
thats call it and see what happens and
this is what we saw

256
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:00,819
initially so essentially will get post
requests

257
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:03,339
against to specific resources cash

258
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:07,500
or policy pounds but interesting
particularity so

259
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,880
none other requests will never have a
user agent there was always

260
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,750
you use a unique eighty Heather now for
some reason

261
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,850
and the the post will have a cough of
course a binary

262
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,250
bill included so very quickly

263
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,950
after calling a we saw

264
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:31,010
around 5 a half a million infections

265
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,060
on over maybe a twenty-four hour we know

266
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,839
on the first day this picture that you
can see is

267
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,720
is the geographical distribution of the
fictions

268
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,959
over 10 minutes time frame so it's

269
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,949
what checking under on a CNC measure
over 10 minutes and you get this picture

270
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:53,089
it's a lot more of course but or 10
minutes is the

271
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:56,959
is what you see edit speak it reach

272
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,089
reached a bit over one million
infections with its

273
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:03,440
like marching said it's a fairly big
mouth your

274
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,809
the one interesting fact

275
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:11,369
was thats their were absolutely zero

276
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:15,129
connections coming from China I was
don't know why

277
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:21,980
met thats that effect we didn't do with
any connections from China and then

278
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,110
the up to this moment was okay we have
here some

279
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:28,389
fairly large what that but we have
absolutely no idea what it is so let's

280
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,600
try to do some

281
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,409
research on top of its because just as a
reminder this was all

282
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:37,350
based on network traffic observation
rather than samples

283
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,050
mean at this point there was no no
samples to deal with which is good is

284
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,100
big and is that it's good because you
can see

285
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,510
things when they start right but you
it's not

286
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:52,250
it's not easy to associate it with a
known our family much

287
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,040
okay and so this when I came in I

288
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,159
as you have set the all these they died
Misrata

289
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,410
belongs to an that works is as I put a
very little to do with my top friends

290
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:03,840
with them

291
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,040
but partner that owns my brain

292
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,790
and my salary so it yeah this one when I
came in a

293
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,420
rows up a a at this this this funny new
but that's very light

294
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,590
using the main from the the Soviet Union
which

295
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,929
as many will knows is very popular among
muppets

296
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:26,110
yeah with you know what what so we are
was not have a look

297
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,800
would kreitzer is possible seems the
algorithms idea

298
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,889
never look at so many Albertans in such
a short period of time

299
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,690
party won with Matt's which he didn't
but I thought this maybe

300
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:42,350
it is the botnet moved to a new over
them that's Italian for a while

301
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:47,730
no wasn't italian a directly competing
for a vault that might be cell

302
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,990
Saudi because of some some similarities
but in the end

303
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,990
not 0x

304
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,850
was in the news when we did research
because October November last year have

305
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,149
been some major breakdowns

306
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,970
and about but possibly try to come back
so kinda made sense that

307
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,440
directors with by newer seems the I were
them but

308
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,370
no wasn't but here we were at a bit of a
loss

309
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,800
and I'm WEA we're a

310
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,350
export before perhaps it isn't the
botnet perhaps it is on bloatware using

311
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,760
some DJ using the Jade not illegal or
anything

312
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,030
brem

313
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,160
well what do you want whenever all else
fails value

314
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,250
look at 10 the botnet sponsors

315
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,630
and you just and some Google we ended
the remainder

316
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,720
the main that's right single Google
seeing if

317
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,940
someone else to do nets that we found
some farce total results:

318
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,620
mural kruzel political happy people in
this room who

319
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,840
and the distance so what happened up the
because a single

320
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,550
farms total nor your query

321
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,740
tell you anything interesting but we
found one interesting

322
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:01,100
will result summer in Thailand's as a
local network

323
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,610
with you Squid proxy sometimes happens
for all

324
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,929
8 be complications on that network and

325
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,560
its proxy had a and web server woulda

326
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,169
the log at this locus accessible in
public and within that by Google

327
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:20,670
and it's not still there and it doesn't
go back away from

328
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:24,400
to where we were evident extremes amber
it's still there

329
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,190
you can see the every day you can see be
going on

330
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:32,370
you can see a is for one particular IP
address on

331
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,260
on that network for a few days ago you
can even see a

332
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,890
for every domain when it was access what
at

333
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,160
what I'm they accessed 8 you can

334
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,910
bill to pick you up but someone was
axing of course it is completely

335
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,350
harmless because all matter data

336
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,679
and we know method as harmless you can
fight me

337
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,520
you find a lot so we could find out
which use on this network

338
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,810
with no do you would want but some

339
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:01,830
use on computer on the network was axing
single I found some interesting things

340
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,169
because it happened several times

341
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,620
several days in a row and shortly before
he was always connects

342
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,629
made what is my IP which is

343
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,680
site that tells your IP address and

344
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,280
afterwards was also was a resume to

345
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,220
this free the main on silica I get its
name

346
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,410
didn't know what it meant but yet some
no I P E

347
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,990
the main aim and thirdly we saw some
links to

348
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,520
some at where but but that doesn't say
very much because if you find someone in

349
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,610
fact that that probably

350
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,830
agrees to be effective it is but the not
very

351
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,090
with that security hygiene so probably
running at work too

352
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,620
doesn't necessarily mean that they're
linked a and follow through to its

353
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,719
and it was network censors did find some
other

354
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,220
correlation between these to sleep the
first two domains and

355
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,500
an hour single and then of course

356
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,720
this is that this IP address of course
is the biggest resolved to our

357
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,440
Osama some IP address which

358
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,250
I'm its let's roll thru looked around
and he got

359
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,130
for the day what the but with the the
next up even be

360
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:19,580
and it turns out if you could park total
the at some point similar

361
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:24,120
the main aim was off to its oliver Sony
more .biz

362
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,030
which is interesting

363
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:30,340
especially because the heat and found
that this domain at indeed in serving

364
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,389
Mirada me what's

365
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,600
with okay perhaps perhaps we r tasting

366
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,179
the smaller around the time

367
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,540
Websense published was actually a very
good blog

368
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,550
on on on Nevada unfortunately a

369
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:50,190
as sometimes happens the blocks it was
added by a PR person who

370
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:54,050
a wrote at this point loss primary
target in the business services

371
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:58,120
government manufacturing transportation
sectors in the US UK Canada and India

372
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,100
with sound really scary of course if you
have a book but with a million

373
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,270
infections them be out for some of them
all

374
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:06,450
be there that they really made it sound
like to come talk to attack them into

375
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:06,890
people's

376
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:11,429
came from russia would make even scarier
and stuff like that it's important

377
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:12,120
because I

378
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,590
really the the result is is one of the
best that's written about that

379
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,030
my father and Anna for example it it all
those

380
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,290
the it said the following that it on

381
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:26,290
C&C IP addresses in one particular as an

382
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:30,159
and and appears that I showed use like
to go

383
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,130
we're on the same is an so then we were

384
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:37,890
even more so than it is once bottom we
found some more

385
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:41,010
lens and and we

386
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:44,150
we also found some more his twenty
domains

387
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,850
not and said this is a agility and would
like to set

388
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:51,159
to that name so again we and it in
Google

389
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,610
if owners only one person at least on
the internet with his name

390
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:58,290
it's a doctor in summer in America okay

391
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:01,909
well happens doctors will have a MPI
numbers website where a collective I

392
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,410
don't know what MPI numbers but

393
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,130
arguments about a book tour experts in
number but is this

394
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,670
all of us on me and Google interest me

395
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:17,670
also find a doctor gotta love a sunny
and a perfume order domains

396
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,139
when I don't know how to pronounce but
the app

397
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:23,809
again as a doctor that

398
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:28,340
is this one letter missing in the in a
domain name and

399
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,360
they're not even on using an IP .biz
using another

400
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,000
for your DNS provider and again that the
doctor again with the FBI number

401
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,909
now at this point I thought for a few
days this is an extremely cool bday to

402
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:41,360
use

403
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,610
what he uses number with MPI number

404
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,870
which had some %uh generates and then
they use this to you got the name of the

405
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,860
corresponding doctor and uses the main

406
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,570
I thought Rd I'm gonna talk Elizabeth
gone everyone will be so excited

407
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,649
and I'll be so proud are turned out to
be it wasn't that

408
00:24:57,649 --> 00:25:00,678
Anna its it's probably just their main

409
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,850
if you're if you're a bother you about
ninety probably have a lot of

410
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,840
data comes from data breaches you
probably have a lot of names

411
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,059
doctors available or you just knew you
can find names are you it's their domain

412
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,039
names because of course

413
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,389
these domains if you would look damn

414
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,289
you could come across them you're in
some research they look on at the loop

415
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:19,639
in

416
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:22,729
with them unlike domains

417
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,600
but while so that these DJ's

418
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:33,600
Bhutto randy mature you produce or that
it's something that is going on so am

419
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,220
conflict at the bailouts I am this is
the

420
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,549
the content of the POST request and X
number of it I'm so you're ignited

421
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:45,629
a lower opening I don't they it's
completely random

422
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:49,049
that is a.m. well it looks random like
this

423
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:52,399
but between multiple were quite schisms

424
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:56,750
as I said we sell millions the the first
nine

425
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,860
bites always the same and as a lot of
similarities which means that

426
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,000
the its leader just obfuscation

427
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,159
or its encryption with the same
encryption key

428
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,500
we don't know in an as far as I'm aware
no one knows what

429
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,529
is really means what you don't need to
know because you can just reply to bail

430
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:15,059
out you get something back

431
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:19,168
and and it if you can see that because
the h2b

432
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:22,679
response and get some days on back i
three some error but

433
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:25,860
but interestingly as this problem

434
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,550
mining protocol inherit some more

435
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,340
and which was indeed

436
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,240
a pic on mining server which

437
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,700
which go to this book Matt what's
actually being used to mind but courts

438
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,040
I know is not the most efficient way use
a botnet

439
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,430
from a from side could not want a few
but still it's

440
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:49,570
its gonna give you some money this is
Hughes botnet

441
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:53,310
even know from being most effective
older not very powerful computers

442
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,540
okay so

443
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:00,180
what have we learned the

444
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,710
and we see what we learned about the
book that's all this unknown

445
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,530
the g8 17 that that's real talk about

446
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:11,200
that's how we call it but they call it
internally before

447
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,630
before we knew it was my thought is was
indeed if I it was a unknown

448
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,660
or variance with me either it was the

449
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,740
split of the door friend of the botnet

450
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,020
or it was always been completely
separate I think

451
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,570
the former is more likely because if you
look at the number of gratitude for

452
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,090
network during October

453
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:33,370
when we 30 the singles to questions

454
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:37,409
at every drop from five to four million
around the time

455
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:41,430
when its routing authority that is from
0 to

456
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:45,450
1 million side the mood would make sense
but they're might be other reasons why

457
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:49,500
this happened it might be a coincidence
this book that was very

458
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,790
very light more than one million
infections the

459
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:58,420
admit what it was in gates in bit by
mining apart from certain hiding with

460
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,510
meds before and then other people had
founded

461
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:05,830
performing click fraud all three
relatively harmless case of cybercrime

462
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,050
compared to other things

463
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:10,990
it's not a rat or anything bad but still
bad and of course if you're affected

464
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,180
then in fact is you computer and a good
something worse

465
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,710
its place now since the

466
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:21,880
to beat it is we because the research I
think in November last year at

467
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,380
and it was never block few things happen
the

468
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,170
Facebook April this year they erode
about

469
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:32,350
a new go to court knew my father very in

470
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:36,790
doesn't use store burger book both the
set by

471
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:40,389
that the new very the what they call 78

472
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:44,570
I am more or less what we already seen

473
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:49,549
did not want some investing resorts
confront basically what we saw

474
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:52,710
a month later

475
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,020
Microsoft the released its this report
about the

476
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:03,540
last quarter of 2013 and it said that

477
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:07,629
notorious about mister released a report
about the for three quarters of 2014

478
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:11,700
and it said that compared to the last
three quarters of 20 13

479
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,540
the number of effected computers dumb
from 6,000 to

480
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,059
18 number key and

481
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:22,750
and this was not so much you to miss a
lot or seven as the caller themselves

482
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,300
but you too

483
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,760
at where that the fund relate to it Adam
previously

484
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,930
block to clean up its at work because
didn't seem to do anything

485
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:34,400
arm for nanoparticles be spreading
what's

486
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,559
a day and I think rightly made decided
with made him decide

487
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:43,360
yet is on for the the cleanup and then

488
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,479
a because there was the cliffhanger

489
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,800
in July 2014 divided yet Michael
published

490
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,149
blog post Friday they found the

491
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:58,200
a connection with some but some hardware
and what actually found a particular

492
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,840
hardware

493
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,129
this this routing and Nevada

494
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,860
which is developed by Israeli company
called by barry a limit

495
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,649
with with with I think would welcome but

496
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,610
plane by whatever integrated front door

497
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:18,899
to or from his own more because as we
all know

498
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,350
most moral try to avoid infecting

499
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:26,469
because in their own country that's the
best way to keep

500
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:32,570
local police the way up since been told
there are quite a few at work companies

501
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,419
based in Israel

502
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,960
all trying to do legal things but not
always succeeding

503
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,080
insane be gone this I would think with
creek crossing the line

504
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,290
am okay so conclusions

505
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:51,020
dating but nice doesn't have to start
with more samples even if involve more

506
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,559
samples

507
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:54,720
we had some samples me run in some boxes
but

508
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,780
there has to be a bit more why doesn't
really up to these days I mean

509
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,960
Meyer my understanding of assembly is is
worse than my friends which has a lot

510
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,380
send you a you can still you can still
do more analysis:

511
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,620
and fine things I'm that's a lot of
useful information about it on the

512
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,070
internet

513
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,409
and detailed on the public Internet
indexed by Google google it

514
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:19,450
has been will be the most useful to
after a after networks

515
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:23,010
single singles for his research

516
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,680
botnet some but not a really big

517
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:32,110
and even if you don't hear about them
but still there don't just bigger

518
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,110
get your ideas from

519
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:38,740
from the news and finally and we're work
nicely on time

520
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:42,910
at work and serve more than just at San
and this hopefully will not be surprised

521
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,990
to anyone in this room I think it can be
repeated

522
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:50,710
questions

523
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:57,710
questions

524
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:01,539
how come to or saw an increase

525
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:04,539
in in visitors from China if

526
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:07,789
move idea was not in China sorry okay

527
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:11,570
it they sit did pope from roger was that

528
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:15,299
israel is the only country that in a
scenic recent war but yet

529
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:19,000
there wasn't any infection in China a

530
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,580
know does not crack it wasn't any
investment I differently the

531
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,080
different we looked at was unknown
barbarian and secondly

532
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,928
the we don't know why it's not in China
but we sold

533
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:33,740
every time let's make that a single just
before at like

534
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:37,909
seconds before at the connection is made
to what is my IP which

535
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:40,919
which makes me sick make as believe that

536
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:44,789
the it something else when a if

537
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:49,370
fire would find it was in China probably
using the same do I P database

538
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,408
that but what it might be used and what
and it was not used to determine

539
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:55,409
location of connections

540
00:32:55,409 --> 00:33:00,280
given that there were more than a
million different IP address collecting

541
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,850
the 24-hour period I would

542
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,309
the if we're just tryna blocking
something or

543
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:08,678
then I would expect I'll to show few

544
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:11,789
stinar walking on on apps and perfect it
was really

545
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:18,789
na Nov million network Mexican from
China

546
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:23,159
a bundler programs that were
distributing Sep net yeah

547
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,560
more popular in China they weren't
popular time you never signed

548
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,740
but not popular doesn't I mean icons are
not popular but

549
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,840
no connection from one million

550
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,240
from the largest internet your country
in the world there may have been some

551
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,590
functionality in the under

552
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:44,370
under programs themselves wouldn't
percent those particular packages in

553
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:44,989
China but

554
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:49,380
I mean I I would expect I can imagine
that the and it would be very low but

555
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,560
someone would visit synar with that
became infected

556
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:57,570
in in in another country so I wouldn't
expect a few

557
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:01,340
a persecuted at but that I

558
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:06,959
I don't know but thanks two things from
me first the

559
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,620

561
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,929
you're a great help and to anyone else
in the room I've also gotten

562
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:22,980
secondly you mentioned you City GA is no
legal

563
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,560
in the UK nothing across most

564
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,610
law enforcement is connected with a
crime

565
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:34,030
then it is admitted possessing it UK if
its link with fraud rinsing

566
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:38,380
we can prosecute people just for having
it because an article for use in

567
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,760
connection with fraud so

568
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,470
just the their more ways to skin

569
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:47,699
capped again I i chipset when I said
there was no I'm not a lawyer a

570
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:48,370
policeman

571
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:52,509
have made is up on the flight are
robbing a legal yes you know more help

572
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:59,510
you know more about Lola night

573
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:03,569
it's my yearly exercise

574
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:07,790
a.m. more question regarding

575
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:11,390
you're singling has more for your
college arm the thing is

576
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:14,660
from I was willing or you do you is a at
the girls

577
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,970
up for yeltsin called by pushing that
over there

578
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:22,180
and/or you distinguish arm legitimate
conflict that ends in calling

579
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,859
and yea depends on

580
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:29,869
on down the mall where we do quite a bit
of work on some

581
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:34,309
particular families to make sure that
the a request is made against

582
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:39,140
a single matches what we would expect
from from an effective device

583
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:42,690
I think that can can can happen

584
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,170
for sure if you mean

585
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,450
the making a request just get registered
as being effective

586
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:54,160
you can do that to register your IP
address

587
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,529
there there are there are it's typical
that we will see

588
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:02,420
stuff hitting like rollers like others
rather research group

589
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:06,490
inquiries SP normal actually cemar

590
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,540
bad guys doing that whenever

591
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:16,540
never get it you still have time for
another question

592
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,640
to come here to the back as well

593
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:29,270

00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,660
Trend Micro polish that mind a lot your

602
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,490
so it's Trend Micro's made the research
and the Canadian Theatre understand and

603
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,149
we

604
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,520

that %uh that's kind of what I meant
with all the way up leads over lines

611
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,290
these people were dead we tried not to
be illegal but that that sometimes fail

612
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,580
and we can all set up might not for how
