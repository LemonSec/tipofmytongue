00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,510
can create want to and programming

8
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:09,060
do not mention or college

9
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:20,520
hi i got our modifications and they add
on for change and original game and we

10
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,530
write in different for movement
languages depending on the game that

11
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,100
we're adding for and minecraft is
written in java so we're going to be

12
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,009
writing our code in Java and a lot of
mods mods and make your game

13
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:40,140
significantly easier or significantly
harder and it's all about whatever you

14
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,290
want to make and you can get with Bob
you can add items in your recipes and

15
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,600
we're going to get some hot later today
we'll be using lift development

16
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,600
environment where to write a hood and my
past was not started going to make sure

17
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,740
that we've written right thing and to
connect with you were using my craft

18
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,250
boards which connects the two and make
them compatible

19
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:12,360
what can we bring our people also use
some of the java programming language so

20
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:20,370
today we're going to start with making
my sharpies and a lot of people make the

21
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:28,019
game to start off programming so we're
going to go out now and hope our like

22
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:35,670
the first thing we see to it that have a
bunch of wine road

23
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:43,050
I get into what those major but for now
we're gonna break down so i'm gonna

24
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:50,100
package mission could end up here model
and much of your handle it can be your

25
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,859
name it whatever you want to call
yourself is what the author is in the

26
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:03,120
name can be anything today my test one
and that way is intended for his money

27
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:10,290
so line for line are all things that
were importing from either mine half

28
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:18,450
files or from my craft words bottom line
34 importing all the blocks are going to

29
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:27,690
stay in the game and that includes your
wood anything so my floor is think it's

30
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:36,329
all the items from the game so comma or
tools whatever that all of our items and

31
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:41,850
some of them were importing from my half
board includes the event handler which

32
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:48,299
tells us that anything that happens is
the derivative but we'll talk about a

33
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,190
little bit more later and game registry
which includes all those already

34
00:03:53,190 --> 00:04:02,910
existing space in the game and not
filters ones so moving down to line 11

35
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:11,430
are 114 is everything that's needed in
the 18 to 49 half court should consider

36
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,170
is a lot so this can be only have within
your mod it

37
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,250
consider mod it will still run into game
even if it doesn't change anything or

38
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:28,560
abdomen so and all that or she to
compare what we write a mod and that

39
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,650
includes the mod ID and the virgin which
are in line there 2014 13 we're gonna

40
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:42,060
have the same thing at our package named
test1 and the version will be one of the

41
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,700
first it's the first version and if you
wanted to change something it would be

42
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:59,280
different like version to version 1.3 or
whatever so lines this team is the event

43
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,369
handler and I just hope the game again
whatever we're creating whatever that is

44
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:12,090
something that will change or modify the
game and then 917 is just similar and

45
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:21,539
just let it tells the game like after
this happens what you get out of it in

46
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:30,840
line 19 is our river here to start
modifying so why 1920s are sure we're

47
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:37,739
going to talk about um so game registry
just again goes all you are you

48
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,730
insisting recipes and is everything and
that way it is it has everything argue

49
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:49,620
there and we already imported that
earlier actually discuss with you is a

50
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:57,030
library within gamer with bloggers and
minecraftforge which just holding the

51
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,590
riding with me no matter where

52
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:07,810
our items that place on the gray which
again are great here you can have any

53
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:13,870
other side of the Ring partner next time
peace in any information and it was

54
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,900
still the seasons world but we're
creating we have to control everyone out

55
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:26,109
of there are two parts everywhere and at
the rules and the recipes so I was told

56
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,890
once say we want to get walking my soon
and will be big

57
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:36,070
I don't into are so magical supposed to
be seeing you is meaning that we're

58
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:42,370
getting a new stack of items out of
Horus so that's walking one block in my

59
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:51,070
slam for you have 646 473 could be the
difference between its you can have

60
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:55,930
anything that isn't exciting so that was
really fun helping models be creative

61
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:02,950
and then the second part of our recipe
is what we have to put in order to get

62
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:11,920
out our result so what that is here is
to position this item and its 1-iron

63
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:21,160
have it so it's section 619 and it can
its time and that everything it can be

64
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:27,220
anything and like that have to make
sense to be whatever what happened and

65
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:33,130
then our second I don't want to put in
for crafting table to get our one love

66
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:33,740
myself

67
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:47,780
is one block here and again just have to
have one and you have a number of dirt

68
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:53,479
walks and you could we have to put that
into r1 so now we're going to run the

69
00:07:53,479 --> 00:08:05,389
game and if it works in the world the
right code and yeah so table have my

70
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:09,650
uncover anything today sorry

71
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:17,929
ok so in our ironing it and the nerve
block of the walk myself there will be

72
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,930
no right

73
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:30,920
listed in our code of shape wasn't happy
i don't any around crafting table and

74
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:37,340
still get our block maximum so we know
that my ceiling were not fake mycelium

75
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:46,970
so yeah now we're gonna go back in two
minutes to talk about and other item or

76
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,890
another recipe that we're going to
create which is going to show our slides

77
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,360
right here this from the heat and we're
going to see what that makes so just

78
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:03,860
like with this has two parts we run to
me what we need to put in but what you

79
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:09,350
little tramp learning circle here
getting out of interest with wanna come

80
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:17,480
over so we put in him and instead of
putting in shape deformation ashamed

81
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:23,480
recipe so that our I don't have to be in
in a specific place on the grid in order

82
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,990
for us to get out our home or any other
than read and then it's going to get one

83
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:37,760
out of it just should not get too crazy
but I happen like 11 report by mistake

84
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,610
and books when I

85
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:49,060
and it happened so we have hot knows
what we're getting out of it by meeting

86
00:09:49,060 --> 00:10:02,439
which is if we would go back to the grid
have arranged in rows and have eight

87
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:10,149
foot in place around and a bowling
center and if we go back and look at

88
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:18,490
this and we have 8 x's around why and so
whatever you know when you're not here

89
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:33,220
and be defined and x2 put in place like
those years at you . then press and then

90
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:40,630
why just why you are you here why in the
middle and then right here is as ye

91
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:46,959
items toppled so bowl finding people and
then come back here and then

92
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:53,250
the way there and then we're going to go
back into my craft and then if that

93
00:10:53,250 --> 00:11:03,270
works and we got the right to run it and
get so again we are happy people here

94
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:10,560
might important to use so we put in our
walks from edge just like they showed an

95
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:18,839
hour in lips and in our slides around
the middle we gotta vote so that were

96
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:33,939
and not a big deal for each year really
any function that we are going to the

97
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:42,310
game we're not friends season and then
is someone and then we close off just

98
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:50,050
what we written changes the game with
which is right here and then for me

99
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:55,449
putting our version and what id we've
been another bracket and then we're

100
00:11:55,449 --> 00:12:04,449
closing off everything with that so that
way we can

101
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:14,750
in it and now argue Edmund change by our
chocolate and if it's not just one thing

102
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:20,480
that you change you don't have to
address you can have your items and the

103
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,780
possibility of programming
