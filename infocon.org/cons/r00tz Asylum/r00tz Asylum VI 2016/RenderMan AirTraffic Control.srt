1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,609
I talk to you about acting and control
systems

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,839
yes this is what I do for fun

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:18,330
so Who am I my day my aunt Esther create
a bank in Canada so yes my job

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,720
description is by breaking the banks for
a little prince of boots I gonna love

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,720
training teaching people to stop

6
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:36,180
personally I am a hacker i'm proud to
say that i am a sex offender lab that's

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,510
number of political groups millions a
notorious Canadian hacker very long time

8
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:53,580
I've been to every dep on Stefan 799 arm
so I've been more constant so this have

9
00:00:53,580 --> 00:01:00,780
a black patch the front well so free
admission is the light but despite the

10
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:08,220
black hat saying bad guys stop for black
and white hat by trade the guy like my

11
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,220
back so I'm often asked why do I have a
monkey

12
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,809
this is Murdock is my traveling buddy is
really fun to happen to playing gets

13
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,579
into mischief with review all just a
really good excuse it to have some fun

14
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:30,119
so long Twitter walk in the store monkey
has a statue problem i try to keep the

15
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:37,710
most family-friendly so packers tend to
look at the world differently we see

16
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,869
things that other ppl minutes see stuff
that they don't want to see you don't

17
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:48,869
want to know that there's a problem we
understand problems that in a big they

18
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,630
are what they affect use

19
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,530
i love using the word models just three
people just don't understand our world

20
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,560
we have a responsibility with this in
our help me the world a better place

21
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,899
here's a story of how i found your
abilities traffic control systems and

22
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,970
now I try to make things better actually
succeeded so has anybody used it was

23
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:22,950
playing finder websites 500 on that very
few hands so most do about the same

24
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:29,760
thing that show you almost real-time
visualization of the claims that are in

25
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,540
here at any time you can search them by
the city's airline specific aircraft

26
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,459
what's really interesting information
allow for some really pretty

27
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,599
here's a las vegas of yesterday

28
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,268
it's just the sheer amount of planes in
the air time and you really pretty

29
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:58,560
visualizations know this is using air
traffic control data singing kind of

30
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,340
days

31
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,489
powered sites be showing all the air
traffic and see all the planes come

32
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:11,130
across the Atlantic into Europe maybe
this is just one day that actually with

33
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,460
complex any plans

34
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:26,880
given to mine I think that's fascinating
any of it works very very big system so

35
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,680
i would have these sites worked aboard
one day when i get bored and things

36
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:40,140
happen where the state of coming from is
provided we do with it in a nutshell to

37
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:46,920
protocol called ats-v which have been
into a second there's networks of users

38
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:55,170
and one of them they have a base station
a big antenna that listens to

39
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:02,070
broadcasters Plains and Native to these
websites that people do is all liberal

40
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,900
journalists information so as i was
looking into this

41
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,990
the hacker part of my brain started
takin over

42
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:16,320
it's like there's some weird things
going on here tomorrow morning and found

43
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,010
has been awake in like 45 years so 80s
be automatic dependent surveillance

44
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:28,920
broadcast basically the planes are now
being with GPS so they know where they

45
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,560
are and they're broadcasting that
sending it out in all directions to air

46
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,280
traffic control it used to get the radar
big dish who send out a signal to

47
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,590
playing bounce back

48
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:50,460
wasn't very exact with the plane music
yes exactly where it is much more exact

49
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:59,039
you know that the amount of information
signals aircraft ID altitude its

50
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,530
specific position where it's headed lot
more information whatever available this

51
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:10,830
is really useful and suddenly places
like Mexico you don't have the radar

52
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,539
station or anything that you actually
have been exactly where the plane is

53
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:22,650
rather than its someone over the water
not always listens that what this allows

54
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:28,979
is for cleans closer together because
they're know exactly where they are they

55
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:35,130
don't have to have as much a part of
safety protocol comes in two forms a DSP

56
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:42,690
out news out from the aircraft being
sent out to air traffic control

57
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:50,910
automatic interaction with air traffic
needs to have its dependent on GPS

58
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:58,140
broadcast as I said calm and gas big air
traffic control so hopefully see movies

59
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,860
and stuff that are now using this data
to

60
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,159
the planes on the map

61
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:11,900
what's with these websites he is in a
new feature that allows claims-based

62
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:18,830
talk to each other so to please the same
area say I'm over to know what your

63
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,539
looking ok earthquakes in there and put
it on the map cockpit of the plane

64
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:30,830
before and now without air traffic
control pilots can now make sure that

65
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,639
there are safely separated other sorts
of features

66
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:41,000
this allows them to do more what's
what's going on around you supposed to

67
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,110
make things safer really simplified
diagram can see it is begin two planes

68
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,219
pocket each other

69
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:56,960
he's out playing down later track tool
for getting the location gps the really

70
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,400
scary thing that I found out about this
is the protocol it is being as

71
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:08,659
unencrypted an authenticated what that
means is a hacker those are two words

72
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:14,900
never want to use anything really
important unencrypted means you want to

73
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:20,479
read it and there's no code no no see
the keys regular that anybody can read

74
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:27,529
this is an authenticated meaning i can't
tell if it's actually playing sending it

75
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:32,750
or someone else making that message
that's kinda scary

76
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:38,120
you can use you know like the little
twenty-dollar RTO

77
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,540
software-defined radios for us BTW
tonight to listen to these things

78
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:51,050
started investigating these things work
bought a whole bunch of different kinds

79
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:57,080
of threats and suddenly yak you find
evidence that they've fixed end this

80
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:04,130
here are the answers were seek or trust
us got to work for me

81
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,299
previous experience is with those
cancers come around

82
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:15,350
he's hiding something whatever reason
it's something that means more digging

83
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:21,620
but you know when you start looking at
the photo call itself too awful lot like

84
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:29,000
your kind of network packet packet
capture village anything this all sorts

85
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,010
it's very simple on any server number
why does this matter

86
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:41,029
well be used over all of the world North
America to be mandated by 2020 all

87
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:44,000
planes are certain size is this

88
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,140
so they're flying overhead right now
this protocol is designed in the late

89
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,380
night is coming for you know many of you
were born

90
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,550
this was before you know a lot of the
current threats that are out there

91
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:01,969
before a lot of these considerations for
security came around so

92
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,510
there you see something really really
old but you can't just change out the

93
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,280
old system overnight this full
deployment is doing the dishes over 20

94
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:21,390
years I fly a lot and I like it home
safely make sure the land's sakes that's

95
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:28,410
why I'm just I'm that you to use your
flying an obvious right

96
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,910
it's just eavesdropping I can as i said
i'm running with his ground stations

97
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,829
feeding these websites i have access to
the raw date i will be the same thing

98
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:44,670
here traffic controllers hard so you
know I have very exact data for

99
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:50,910
airplanes already given time you know i
can use for data money i know it's

100
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:57,959
telling me the kind of plane that it's
it is registered to look that up you

101
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,340
know i can track things like Donald
Trump's plane flying all that

102
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:09,780
celebrities executives you know knowing
who's going where of vacation stuff like

103
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,100
that could be interesting for people

104
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:20,330
really there's a lot scarier things that
possible that i have thought so I don't

105
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:26,600
want that people think of the first but
what happens we start sending our own

106
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,600
data into the system as if we were
playing said it's authenticated there's

107
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,880
a bit of an oversimplification there's
other systems but what happens if I

108
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,720
refuse

109
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,960
50 extra planes in the air traffic told
they're still and wait there was only

110
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,430
three planes are a minute ago

111
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:51,680
why is 50 expert that until my schedule
problem confusion

112
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,970
how does the system deal with it i don't
know i can't find any evidence that

113
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:01,910
tested that what happens to the
introduce slight variations you know say

114
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:08,390
oh yeah I know like has the same data is
light and then so that word to them what

115
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:13,580
happens then I was the system decide
which is one now you do this during you

116
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:21,650
whether busy holidays Thanksgiving is
always the same air travel best times to

117
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:27,050
start messing with the system particular
back things of a week events like the

118
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:31,670
Olympics for your God huge number of
people all going one place will start

119
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:37,819
disrupting systems there what's going to
happen i don't know i don't want to be

120
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,440
one of the flights to find out and
there's some evidence that air traffic

121
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,570
control systems and handle things like
what if there's two planes the same ID

122
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:52,640
number broadcasting it never expected
that should never happen

123
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,300
but systems work design thinking about
weird stuff they were assuming

124
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,269
everything's to be always perfect

125
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:10,930
no actors thrive where systems are doing
they aren't perfect but we just jail or

126
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:16,959
traffic control of right well yes do
things like direction by name figures

127
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:24,638
signal guys big truck gun is to shut
down all that stuff but it's really hard

128
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:31,810
to do that so do they have at airports
capable of doing they have a good have

129
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:37,899
the knowledge I don't know but if you
are only doing it for an hour 30 minutes

130
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:40,779
and then you go away

131
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:48,189
well they're not gonna find you a target
someplace like olympics in rio and

132
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:53,560
legacy the appliance all these plates if
you do this across the whole bunch of

133
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:00,250
different places that Thanksgiving the
places like Amber oh la llanta Chicago

134
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,959
you can make a whole country stop lying
in the plane . communication gets

135
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,959
scarier program

136
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,480
so I'm gonna be injected into the air
traffic control system that means i can

137
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,209
also have access to the main I inject
stuff that's you're confusing air

138
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:29,800
traffic sources one thing planes scopes
has different that's gonna take time to

139
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,269
sort out is they not have to get voice
talk to your traffic school girl what's

140
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:42,160
going on there's situations where yeah
they can't see what's below them but if

141
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,389
the system is reporting that there's a
flight coming towards them from below

142
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:55,000
I can't onto the floor something's gonna
happen on that flight in on every day

143
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,490
and everybody in stories shared botas
real chances of that happening

144
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,700
that's not evidence after the surgery so
me

145
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,880
Oh

146
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:19,350
these things like since this was based
on yes but 50mg ps4 $20 outside china i

147
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:26,460
can get gps jammer it's in my carry-on
bag nothin want to be a little you can

148
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:31,860
do something bigger around there's lots
of ways to do it scarier when you look

149
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:38,850
at things at CVS generating fakes
signals that means is that i can

150
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,020
basically tell the planes

151
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:46,800
yes it's anywhere I wanted to be so
suddenly all the benefits of having this

152
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:54,420
plane decisive areas in the world lost
independence flag in Las Vegas certainly

153
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:02,790
explains things over top of Chicago
that's a problem a lot of pilots are

154
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:11,640
flying always older instruments bouncing
and practice a lot so they know when the

155
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:17,100
system is being masses they know when
there's been maybe a small cage in gps

156
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:24,000
if you're just a mile or two to the left
to the right Cap'n difference between

157
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,870
making it to the landing strip or
mountain

158
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,410
the response from the authorities a
lesbian

159
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:42,380
trust us I never trust anyone just
presented defcon funny about this

160
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:50,450
information and really it was here's my
evidence i can't prove they fixed the

161
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,650
campus please test it yourself

162
00:15:54,650 --> 00:16:03,500
show me scientific method i wanted to be
wrong and flying I wanted to bring

163
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:09,529
experience people to know things i want
to fááá everybody to come out and say

164
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:13,070
hey yeah here's how we build those
things with no problems

165
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:22,610
happy to be wrong but you know it wasn't
immediately but it takes time but the

166
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:28,130
story is about accuracy in air traffic
control systems people and the next

167
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:36,140
year's they started looking into this
stuff they finally are difficult and not

168
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:41,930
him it's not too soon because there is
actually software so you can get club

169
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:48,469
that allows you to send transmissions
with this simple software-defined radios

170
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,910
honor dollars it's really wanted to do
an attack need some more equipment

171
00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:02,610
all the pieces are there this video is
this is just showing using a flight

172
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:08,849
simulator and your vertical plane it's
actually generating out data-intensive

173
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:15,359
sent to a radio and then he put into the
air to your virtual plane heart of

174
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:23,879
controls concern is actually flying the
real world for making different students

175
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,959
in a few years

176
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:31,380
good they're now starting to put
together task force's look at these

177
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,690
social security threats

178
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,900
it took him two years after picking my
presentation but they actually sat down

179
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,000
and working group looked at all the
stuff on the threats that they come up

180
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,400
with the same as mine

181
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,400
it's always nice to find out you're not
crazy

182
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:56,690
Dave needs security part of guidance
documents whole bunch of the things the

183
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:03,740
latest is the FAA funding cybersecurity
research center industry authorization

184
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,660
comment dollars into a place where they
can actually haven't tested these things

185
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:18,350
what that says to me is didn't have one
before X so packers putting pressure on

186
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,070
an industry like this even if it's
something to check the kensic like your

187
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:33,530
control can help effect it may take time
not direct but can happen so it is

188
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:41,840
basically mandatory several interviews
for awhile safety engineering security

189
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,040
engineering that's the biggest problem
with your craft

190
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,170
if your day it's safe its secure

191
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:57,280
no it's not so what we should take out
of this is your decision i saw following

192
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,670
others didn't see I've learned unlikely
asked questions talking to people

193
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:09,070
yeah I'm trying to and responsible
disclosure but something like air

194
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,300
traffic control system there's no phone
number to call up to report

195
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:18,909
vulnerabilities it's too big but tried
reaching out to LA in other countries

196
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:28,960
yeah normal ok i could give up no did my
presentation on said hey she's proved me

197
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,710
wrong

198
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:36,580
here's by of its got something better to
show me they didn't I kept asking

199
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:43,480
questions for the next four years so me
prove me wrong and now they're starting

200
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,610
to make changes and that's that's really
good thing is that a lot of us myself

201
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,260
included a flight home

202
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:56,410
so basically from curiosity about how
he's playing finding sites worked

203
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:04,870
actually hear traffic control for the
entire glow from my couch anyone could

204
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:10,719
do these sort of things about being
observant sealers problems are and time

205
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,440
to solve responsible

206
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,509
anyone can do these awesome things
actors are awesome people so thank you

207
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:18,870
very much
