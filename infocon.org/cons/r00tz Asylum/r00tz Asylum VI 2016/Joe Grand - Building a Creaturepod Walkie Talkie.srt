1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,950
hello everybody my name is Joe Graham I
am a hard worker by trade

2
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,630
I'm an electrical engineer by schooling
but I basically get paid to have fun

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,010
stuff and teach people how to do it so
it's sort of like the best job that I

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,250
could ever have someone asked me you
know like when I was a kid what you want

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,849
to be with when you grow up I said I'm
gonna be an electrical engineer i gotta

6
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,630
build stuff out of electronic sounds
like it's something created and that

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,600
ended up turning into my life I can go
to DEFCON for a really long time having

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,660
a resource like this place for you come
with your parents to happen stuff is

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,620
awesome and I heard somebody i was
sitting down is his daddy can we go pick

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,089
locks now and like that is awesome right
like that doesn't happen in your school

11
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,649
if you said that in Silicon getting a
lot of trouble so this presentation I've

12
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,460
talked to Silas before about various
projects with this one is really special

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,239
because it's something that i worked on
with my kids have a four-year-old 27

14
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,839
year old and no they have cd stuff on my
own but this is the first time where we

15
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:08,829
utilizing awesome project together so
for you kids out there having you guys

16
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:13,029
have worked on on something with your
parents together almost everyone that's

17
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,719
awesome

18
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:16,990
and this is something where it's like
you know it's fun to play with them with

19
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,610
what they want to play Legos or they
want to do something you know play tag

20
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,799
outside but this is something that it
was like really exciting to do and I

21
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,280
want to get involved in sort of thing
they came up with the idea that we went

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,659
about it so what is it something public
future far how did you guys see while

23
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:37,479
press cool show right

24
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:42,340
awesome so it basically for those of you
who haven't seen it it's all pbskids

25
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:48,159
it's too brother their real-life zoology
and invite their biologists a biologist

26
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,780
and they go around

27
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,280
animals and learned about animals and
they take the car to go on these crazy

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,820
preacher adventures so really this is no
teaching kids about realized and more

29
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,798
problems and the environment and stuff
so there's one thing in the show called

30
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,659
the picture part this is like a video
walkie-talkie wireless no risks and

31
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:11,470
fountain thing that they could wear in
the show they talk to each other with

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,540
them and there's a video stream stuff so
my kids said we want to try to build up

33
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,690
like this they come to take that it can
be built a picture father and I'm like

34
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,989
well I don't know if we could build the
whole thing but let's let's see what we

35
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:23,739
can do

36
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:29,380
so you know the main problem is this
isn't real this is just the party so we

37
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,340
ended up finding online like a future
fast from our best to keep our distance

38
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:39,970
so that was okay but it still wasn't
real like they wanted the real deal and

39
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,310
we ended up finding these things you
know plastic junk right almost real

40
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:49,268
so I said all right where we let's try
to get their own because if something

41
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,940
isn't out there you want it and you
think of something you could build a

42
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,730
room so sort of the process for designer
product first we have to be like I

43
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,209
mechanical design to make sure that we
knew the right shape of what we're going

44
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:05,290
to build so I had my son tres out what
you wanted to create your father look

45
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,130
like and then we use that to sort of
place are searching for design which

46
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:14,380
will see it looks very similar to the
original picture fog what we have to do

47
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,920
from electronics point of view is put
together the actual electronics design

48
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,798
because this was a real product that
actually was going to do something

49
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,570
really is going to be a walkie-talkie
you could talk to your friends with and

50
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,560
carry around and take to your wrist or
whatever so I put together a block

51
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,660
diagram my kids help choose the parts
they want to use you know one of them

52
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,799
wanted blue button is one of them wanted
yellow button that we look through

53
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,150
electronic catalogs and pick the parts
we were together this block diagram that

54
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,640
basically show these major subsystem the
major parts of the project the one right

55
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,410
in the center is an arduino Arduino is
like a entry-level electronic module

56
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:59,290
that's very easy to work with that you
can write code in c and control things

57
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,290
of the world basically the programmable
computer if you have existed that

58
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,159
they're very cool so I'm using Arduino a
small version called the meeting which

59
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,030
is a really kind you want if you look on
the back of the creature father passed

60
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,480
around

61
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,909
it's a really small little computer on a
chip we have a display we have a radio

62
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:16,769
transmitter

63
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:22,440
we have a battery and a bunch of buttons
to basically choose which friend you

64
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,349
want to talk to you because we have
pre-programmed for three of their

65
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:31,319
friends before the friendswood their
brother duh to the post about who they

66
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,199
want to talk to and it will show up on
the screen so basically the design is

67
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,460
like a handful of things that exist and
then we're taking those and turning into

68
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,919
something new that doesn't system

69
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,508
here's the development process one of
the first things you have to do before

70
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:49,409
ends up as a circuit board which is kind
of the final thing is we need to order

71
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:54,150
the parts we come upon something that we
can test that so we look up on something

72
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,349
called a breadboard which is a way that
we could blood components to it and as

73
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:02,400
what changes to the project itself
doesn't work we can take apart and put

74
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,210
another one in

75
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,840
so it's part of that for typing process
at the same time is this i had to write

76
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,190
a bunch of software and he was funny one
. the person we want to do is get the

77
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,030
display working and we use a special
display from a company called me to

78
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,690
prove who makes a bunch of electronics
hobbyist modules we want to display

79
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,400
pictures on it on LCD on the front of
this blood which seems like it'd be easy

80
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,560
ride with every bone had the display

81
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,740
computer has a display but it's actually
not that easy

82
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,419
so we spent a few hours modifying the
code trying to get pictures that we

83
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:39,539
store on SD card into the side of the
LCD display on the screen and i remember

84
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,919
it was like probably nine o'clock at
night and my pitch should've been asleep

85
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,549
so my four-year-old went to bed really
my seven-year-old went upstairs and try

86
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,150
to possibly came back down half an hour
later I got it connects people too

87
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:59,580
excited about trying to see if you get
to display working so I let him stay up

88
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,440
with me until like 1030 happened on this
day and we finally got the screen to

89
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,940
turn on and display picture in words
like that was awesome and then he could

90
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,360
because he was too excited that we want
to display a word but you know sort of

91
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,440
incorporating having you stay up with me
like he got to really feel that that

92
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,639
kind of passion that you get when you
find a a security problem when you get

93
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,820
to do something cool you pick a lock
when you solve a problem like it's

94
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,750
awesome right and that's that feeling
that you could get being a half-hour or

95
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,340
no great something

96
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:34,440
once we selected the proponents once we
have the prototype working we didn't

97
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,770
lock up to make sure that the system
with you look at we wanted to look at

98
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,520
all the parts fit and then I ordered
circuit boards i designed to serve

99
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,240
before and had it made up for my friends
company called ash Park which is

100
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,600
basically the company that takes
everybody everybody start before designs

101
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,560
with the amount of giant panels that get
manufactured by a circuit of

102
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,880
professional support fabricator and then
you get your boards back so it's a way

103
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,560
that like that kids and obviously people
are just messing around and want to

104
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,950
babysit for you don't have to pay a lot
of money to get the bait anymore and

105
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,560
that's how we could do something like
this like this is no really crazy

106
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,110
project we got spending that much
running so we got the circuit boards

107
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,400
back and you know my kids want to be
involved in the process of getting this

108
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,599
before it's ready

109
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,120
soldering afford all that i talked about
how to solder when they were three so

110
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,960
you know that was they got to build the
board so they feel pretty much all of

111
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,930
the board except for like the really
small surface parks is what goes on

112
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,490
myself so here's my four-year-old
sanding the edges of the circuit board

113
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:42,300
just to get all the rough edges off and
my seven-year-old here is a soldering

114
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,410
get connected connectors onto the
display which then go on to this before

115
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,250
so it's really kind of a fun project and
on the right we have to program the code

116
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,389
so we have our hardware but then you
still need to have your software that's

117
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:55,490
running with you

118
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,870
and telling the hard work to do so we
have a program that is special about

119
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,860
that you're basically telling the
burning want to do once you have that

120
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,289
all together that we had our final
creature card with you guys that seemed

121
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:14,240
somewhere pass around and they were
actually jealous that I got to talk to

122
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,099
DEFCON to give his talk because we have
given a larger version of more detailed

123
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:24,500
version of this presentation at a packer
camp of torque and a few months ago and

124
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,650
they were actually up on stage me giving
the presentation and i said i'm going to

125
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,799
talk about our future quadruped again
but they were really angry because they

126
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,860
wanted to be the ones up here doing it
instead of being inside sort of the

127
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:40,190
battle pack so the challenges that come
with designing electronics that come

128
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,659
with having on things

129
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:45,740
it's not always easy and if you get
really frustrating it could get you know

130
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:51,110
you might before with their like get
really frustrated if you just walk away

131
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:57,500
back to the project again so at one
point during the process by my

132
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,180
seven-year-old reading this is really
hard work as yeah you know sometimes

133
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:07,680
it's hard and they also said it's also
boring so he will know what often and

134
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,160
you know and that's to do is like
sometimes you know engineering might be

135
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,449
boring if you're trying to create
something it's not going to me like i

136
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,930
like it so you know you find what'd you
end up loving to do and it doesn't

137
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:24,209
seaboard we have another problem with
the radio that meant to fix it was

138
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:28,319
somewhat expensive but you before but it
follows their friends wanna take it ends

139
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,709
up being like a hundred dollars as he
saw something just because we're not

140
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:35,399
flying a lot of them so when you when
you buy things in small quantities like

141
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,080
one or two they cost a lot more turkeys
that if you're going to buy a hundred

142
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,370
thousands of them and maybe factor like
an iphone or something in their fragile

143
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,529
so you can see the units of hats around
have some blue tea poxy on the side that

144
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:53,670
basically i tried to reinforce the LCD
because they kept cropping up and great

145
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,020
people displays so i have to buy a
display board and its expenses so i put

146
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,870
the flu around it to help with that

147
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,200
so you know when they're house-hunting
with the future parts sometimes they

148
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,760
break but even with all the problems it
was totally worth it like it was a

149
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,839
really fun project I think we probably
spent don't know three or four days

150
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,500
together working on it was like pretty
excited and I think the most important

151
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:23,970
thing that came out of it is that they
can you know create whatever is in their

152
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,220
mind in kids III whatever is in there

153
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,420
right it's like you don't have to tell
somebody say all that doesn't exist like

154
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,300
you can't do that it doesn't it you
could say well I'm gonna learn how to

155
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,930
build a building myself and that's part
of the fun of it is sort of empowering

156
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:43,569
people to do this and build things and
not buy stuff off of the show and I

157
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:46,389
think that was really fun park so if you
want to make your own if you want to

158
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:50,319
convince your parents to go pay the
money to buy the parts build them it's

159
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:55,449
very easy to do you go to my website all
of the electronic design files are there

160
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:59,529
and then if you go to wash park which is
the website where i ordered the circuit

161
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:03,459
board you can go there and buy the parts
the charges five dollars a square inch

162
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,290
so I think the board would like to get
dollars at least something like that and

163
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,910
get the slides are also available online

164
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,139
everything you need is on my website you
can make your own build up putting your

165
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:18,639
own pictures change the frequencies were
using off-the-shelf radio module from

166
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,660
that was manufactured in China that
basically used three radio systems

167
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,939
walkie-talkie so what these are actually
real walkie-talkies with a little

168
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:29,019
straight on there

169
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:32,709
yes I guess the takeaway is you can
build whatever you want you can design

170
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:35,920
things you can take stuff apart you can
learn how they work

171
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,000
this is the place to do it with your
parents supposed to do it if the teacher

172
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,829
says you can't do something maybe
question that as long as not like

173
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,859
original rules sorry up to the parents
but you know it's like maybe

174
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,000
can build something that you think it
possible like if I capture the number of

175
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,200
times somebody said what i was doing
woodwork that would be you know I

176
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,140
wouldn't be on the stage I would be
crying somewhere in the corner so you

177
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:04,430
have to do what you love and what I
weather electronics are picking locks or

178
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,959
software or apps or whatever it is that
work stuff you know do you love to do

179
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,780
don't always listen to adults because
they're not always right all the adults

180
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,780
are like a true kids are the future

181
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,870
ok so i'll give you a little demo
where's the other creature fog so let's

182
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,020
see let's see we cannot we'll stick them
up and we'll choose the right channel so

183
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,800
i have if there's three different
buttons so i will choose like this one

184
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,120
has been that's my that's my
seven-year-old connect that to this one

185
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,830
mile so miles has already had a picture
man on his so basically selecting the

186
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:42,860
channel that I want to transmit and
receive the radio signal on because

187
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,780
there's my personality see this let's
take some kids you guys want to use in

188
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,310
the front row here talking to walking
talking your bed yeah I guess come up on

189
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,079
stage we do a real life

190
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:01,050
deepest works and then what's your name
boy okay I'm gonna give doing the

191
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:05,459
walkie-talkie so the way he uses what
you do is there's the microphone and

192
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,670
that's the button so when you want to
talk to me you hold down the button and

193
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,270
then talk into the microphone today so
I'm gonna get mine to see if this works

194
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,950
so here I'll do attempt to you first see
the speakers on the backside

195
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,260
hello hello testing

196
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:30,660
did you hear that it's not allowed okay
so have you talked to your work so now

197
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,439
we have a we communicate we could go
playing we have our walkie-talkies

198
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,050
so that's it you know it's a fun way to
do projects that ya go activate your own

199
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:44,400
engineering hours and build your own
stuff so thank you for coming and

200
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,670
watching
