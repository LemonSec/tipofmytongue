1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:17,779
so first city we had no idea what it and
boot so that hours and we'll meet my

2
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:27,169
brother's trying to go and get two weeks
for them and so this little guys block

3
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:34,220
and you come out that my diet and it was
first inspired me to start so to start

4
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,660
off instead of just jumping right into
3d printing the way that unique things

5
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:44,059
is maybe actually so many action . boy

6
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:50,719
typically in a factory which making
actually at a subtractive manufacturing

7
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:58,609
which is over their genes that block we
added an apartment in Manhattan for your

8
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:10,220
objects faction which ad years and years
adding layers of helps because you're

9
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:17,298
reducing waste whereas attracting
whatever you put away that's always and

10
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:24,079
started fasting just because the
materials are widely all over the place

11
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,658
so the fact that away

12
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:41,270
thats everywhere we're quite a bit too
quickly with Austin weird for their 3d

13
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:48,079
printing is away materials typically
plastic to form an object design or you

14
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,809
get off a website so what could actually
use part number one you side stays sort

15
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:59,899
of typing so let's say you want to make
something like a science fair project

16
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:05,329
which is something i did I can just
print it and then it just a small part

17
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:07,520
of it you can just be printed again

18
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,530
where is it

19
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,940
before you seal it somewhere and design
and have to wait a week to get it all

20
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,500
the way back again

21
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:23,860
now you can just fast me pregnant again
and they're probably hard for homes so

22
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:33,640
card like you want our customization
back and typically within our plastic so

23
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:45,549
it's actually even today very helpful
all my heart

24
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:53,739
regular I also pretty much and I want to
help out a friend

25
00:02:53,739 --> 00:03:11,950
portable and just like like another
medical so pretty much people and let

26
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:31,328
something my job any other general but
you just do you sell it and another use

27
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:37,989
current one is green tissue or organ
sales

28
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:49,079
so you're working organ organ transplant
organ instead of having to have going

29
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,800
for you

30
00:03:49,800 --> 00:04:02,220
so c-47 which is science technology and
people are shocked to see a lot of women

31
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:09,300
most innovative minds their kids out
there they can imagine so what if they

32
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:16,380
can spread it right there so that's good
for your soo so what type of printed

33
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:22,320
don't print and ate like a normal t
printer they actually put in the most

34
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:31,890
suitable is so you and then its type
fast and very or so types of Fox printed

35
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:40,380
our 80s healing and healing light lamp
face blasted and it's very it's very

36
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:49,440
usable environment helps the environment
abs durable hard plastic that typing or

37
00:04:49,440 --> 00:05:00,510
something that will drop its not
typically aggressive prostate and so

38
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,800
once you put it it goes down if each
player and hardens it and it's a lot

39
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:12,960
harder and faster vs like melting
because the way it works is that your

40
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,380
group and it has to take some party hard
plastic internet is a good at heart

41
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,219
yes

42
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:30,870
absolutely right click with your partner
medal for you Sarah once since then it's

43
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:45,450
hard to find in the house it's typical
temperature here is to Celsius very good

44
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:51,180
but that say hi to a lot to me

45
00:05:51,180 --> 00:06:00,120
temperature for something called Milky
Way which is actually a metal plastic

46
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:10,200
plastic but it will have seen so big
plastic and in my favorite parts of

47
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:22,590
chocolate face on it customized who is
another meeting new people

48
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:35,549
whatever shape producing events at dog
race or something you can put all your

49
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:47,040
dog shoes for this type is PA and PA in
plastic so it goes in and support

50
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:53,640
material that's something of a bridge
and usually plastic with the whole

51
00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:00,180
building just to your typical process
very hard to get off

52
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,860
they are material so if you see a drop
in water

53
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:19,320
so soft so what's really going on its
export like number of it this way you

54
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:35,219
can find more you tighten add to your
house of super like any pic what I'm

55
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:43,980
never going to sketchup so stitch-up ok
it's not that hard

56
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:54,780
typically used for just shines and
finish actual item and they're under

57
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:03,900
another and typically use whatever and
explore it

58
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:21,030
you can also get signed up internet so
software it out you can just the next

59
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:26,070
seven exporting you make your current
and then export typically want to

60
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:35,220
exploit stl file most white smile
especially superbug you have a common

61
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:43,950
one is I obj so Wow and experts that you
have fire after that we're going to

62
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:55,500
slightly so you frequent slicing our
hero for Jeanette bad and then some not

63
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:03,030
so everyone's being absolutely are
simplified and make the Box make the

64
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,030
body you can make software but it won't
work early thoughts

65
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:18,319
and the output of registry from an stl
file and she would die if you take a nap

66
00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:24,378
it's going to be a mount for every later
absolutely up to that it's going to be a

67
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:35,899
band there are different every single
looking very large this a clean what

68
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:43,100
type of three years slicing shows how
different each one and there's a final

69
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,239
and my favorite stuff that you have your
wonderful off
