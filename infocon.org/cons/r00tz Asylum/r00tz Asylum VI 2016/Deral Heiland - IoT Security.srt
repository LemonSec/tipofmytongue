1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,670
next up is Darrow he's going to be
talking about when the lights go out and

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,969
like talk about IOT like security so I
first moved into this role you know I

3
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:17,009
had really put a lot of attention

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:24,119
are you team himself them research
remember years ahead and semi UT so this

5
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:24,810
is the one

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:34,170
what value ID so key points with with
minority its difficulty interrelated

7
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:41,370
devices selected share data what they do
they networked together and they often

8
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,339
involved that electronics but to get a
better understanding of IOT from a

9
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,760
security perspective i had to stand out
more

10
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,480
this helps to better analyze and
understand do research and i use this

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,980
concept here

12
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:06,960
io te raak just embedded device I
t-mobile's multiple that this includes

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,729
the mobile applications that involves
the cloud in the clouds usually programs

14
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,690
application that your phone communicates
through

15
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:27,390
and you also have been hard work and
Benton Harbor also found this does this

16
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,250
over the network or various other
communication protocols on each one of

17
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,520
these pieces there's code and there's
also do exchanges this is how i approach

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:46,619
researching theology technology looking
at this whole system all the pieces that

19
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:53,490
we can better understand secured with so
let's go ahead and dig into the research

20
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,729
area so started off looking at that
whole ecosystem that whole list of items

21
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:05,160
that make up I of OT we dig in as part
of it so we actually start looking at

22
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,619
the hardware we go really down to the
hardware this picture up here it will

23
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,760
give you a little bit of perspective of
what lighting is that's actually the

24
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:21,209
circuit board i cut out of a light bulb
so we're able to take that circuit out

25
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:26,520
like we're able to analyze we're able to
power up separately outside of this

26
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,620
environment were able to hook to it
there's connectors on their reaction to

27
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:38,520
establish a serial connection and we can
actually see the light bulb boot up and

28
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,930
we were analyzed that possible security
issues also we looked at the mobile

29
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,940
application that development and inside
the local application found a number of

30
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,550
vulnerabilities an example was what we
refer to as necessarily the company that

31
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,020
wrote the program

32
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:03,330
doing necessarily what SL when you
connect to the web internet over HTTPS

33
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:10,980
and ugh change so it's all encrypted if
you don't to the actual ssl certificate

34
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,859
an attacker can get in the middle to
abandon the middle attack so the SLP

35
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,110
really crippled one of the other things
we found was on the mobile apps they

36
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:27,270
were actually saw read data wonderful
app unencrypted things like passwords

37
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,840
wireless configuration appreciated
please

38
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,810
another form of password in a if you
lost your phone and someone got the

39
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,520
phone they can hack into it and then
turn around and get the wireless keys to

40
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,630
gain access to your home or business
wireless network we also typically

41
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,079
utilize the cloud since the clouds

42
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,150
ap is typically just what services and
the attacker can attack the web services

43
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,640
and became more breaking into those now
he use that data will break into your ID

44
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,160
technology of your home or at your
workplace so as you see as look at this

45
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:11,370
it's the whole relationship all these
pieces that make up volatility it's not

46
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,770
just the hardware

47
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:17,239
actually have some hardware we pull it
out real quick so we're doing this work

48
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:20,599
we were looking at a couple things of
lighting systems

49
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:26,150
this happens to be a lighting system to
choose your home for the plugs in and

50
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:32,210
use your mobile phone control the lights
in your house while the attacks found

51
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,039
here was when you were using your mobile
phone communicates the cloud this

52
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,680
communicates the cloud that exchange
control your lights and you have to

53
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:49,700
dedicate to do that so secure we found
out that when the club was not access

54
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,890
with away this went into a local and the
local mode is not secure

55
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:00,020
there was no authentication so that we
could actually see convenience straight

56
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,280
to this authenticated and we could do
things like turn your lights on them off

57
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,260
and we also were able to reconfigure it
on the fly so it's instead of attaching

58
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,120
your home wireless we could get attached
to someone else's wallet with injections

59
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,150
also were analyzed all if you look at
the whole network the communication and

60
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,859
what these devices you multiple paths of
communication so we're all familiar with

61
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:30,680
ethernet so this device is the
enterprise but that same product but a

62
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,330
larger enterprise level version these
devices this one actually connect the

63
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,889
ethernet it also have Wi-Fi

64
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:45,219
and also both is communicated to the
light ball with protocol called city and

65
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:51,520
we found out with the same protocol home
automation standard sig has no

66
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,279
worthwhile security has all been broken
long time and that means that indicates

67
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,120
the ball

68
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,080
it sets up and Chris problem is that
he's been broken and everyone knows

69
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,449
where it is never changes

70
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:09,430
ok it turned out that the enterprise
version using you're saying that the

71
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,659
risk there you know and a home you know
your neck your next-door neighbor to

72
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:15,460
turn your lights off

73
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:21,549
that's not a good thing but imagine if
they return the lights off the store or

74
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:29,199
hospital or any other business to bigger
impact we also found out that the

75
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:35,800
enterprise version as as a web interface
to show demo web interface so the web

76
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,139
interface oneness and log onto it and
they get into the kitchen to get control

77
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:48,430
set the device up configure all that fun
stuff but on with our web interface got

78
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,889
to think about what's going on the
attack

79
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:55,689
this is setting in the city in business
and people are walking onto it

80
00:06:55,689 --> 00:07:00,879
they're logging onto with ministry level
access what's the other thing to

81
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,020
remember is is more than likely the
person going

82
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:10,198
as administrative access the room and a
lot of times we also have a minister

83
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:16,979
that's relevant access and corporate
network all the way there we can attack

84
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:22,020
them via the web interface we could
potentially compromised machines were

85
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:31,979
the entire network so what happens is
this census has a web server web server

86
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:36,389
on here's their different when you feel
accomplished types and we're always

87
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:41,849
hearing about all the tops on the people
breaking in and stealing compromise the

88
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:46,289
conversation with things like sequel
injection and cross-site scripting

89
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:51,870
attacks so in this case we actually
found to cross-site scripting attacks on

90
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:58,710
this one of them was on the log on so we
hit the web page and ask for using we

91
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:06,030
found Yoko for java code of the username
and it would get written to the security

92
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,559
walk in this box

93
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,349
so when they actually you the security
logs in the box we were actually execute

94
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:16,349
code given this ability to attack

95
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:23,490
so we have a fun little example where a
little different one

96
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,889
let me state it up first so these
devices also interact with your wireless

97
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:33,899
so when you set one of these up with
your network and plug-in you can also

98
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:40,320
connect to your wireless attacker could
compromise boxes really can also

99
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,620
possible pivoted internal so that's a
serious but in the demo here what we're

100
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,750
going to do is this particular one we
found out that the configuration page

101
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:57,899
for setting up the wireless you everyone
knows what is ideas is that the TV

102
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:02,040
wireless network is the long winter so
when you go on a phone or your computer

103
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,230
and you want to connect to your wireless
network giving nate know its coal mines

104
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:14,040
coal network here my house i tried
breaking into it bother you but give it

105
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:21,149
an able to begin state we found out we
can actually the SSID javascript needs

106
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:28,680
to not in the name so when it's
processed on machine all things just

107
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,579
happen

108
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:34,290
let's go ahead stage this up so that the
lighting lighting management system

109
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,689
belonging to pick one up there

110
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,150
we're gonna come down here we're gonna
log onto we're going to

111
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,990
hacked into the wireless client mode
settings and right here you can see

112
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,480
these s ideas and shoot up the place
inside these are bigger house here this

113
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,630
bottom what we're going to do is fire
with a soft air base into we're going to

114
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,610
give it a pain that's where are you
going to be a little special thing for

115
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:21,810
them so when it connected to it is a
little tricky but more serious there's a

116
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:27,689
lot of things we can inject we could
potentially take control machine that

117
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:34,860
he's in the corporate network then we
can miss a compromise so a very serious

118
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,610
problem one of the last things for you
bored

119
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,740
we also found out when you're setting up
a secure partners we set up things like

120
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:50,160
a wpa wpa2 get a password to secure
Wi-Fi file to home

121
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,530
what we do the same thing with these
devices here the whole the home has

122
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,610
appreciated

123
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:02,970
that's 10 characters long its output
Marik upper lower case so it creates a

124
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,920
very large space makes it very hard to
root for standard tap

125
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:15,020
yeah Ryan version when they set it up
the key space is only eight characters

126
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,550
long

127
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:27,829
alpha lower kids it's a 30 which creates
a very small piece face make it possible

128
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:36,650
for us to actually attack person in the
wireless and cracking passwords in less

129
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:46,699
than five hours turning this into an
access access into the corporate week as

130
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,480
much for this thing we actually work
with the vintage one of the biggest

131
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,490
thing is epic disclosure in this case I
worked closely with this company

132
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:01,070
actually friends with number people
there and we were actually able to help

133
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,630
them fix their product so what's all the
critical vulnerabilities were eventually

134
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:11,750
published information so that everybody
is aware of another country knowledge

135
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,650
for pointing out when you're dealing
with peyote technology are the most

136
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,640
important things is I mean we're always
going to find all abilities

137
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:25,280
they're going away but we want to do is
we want to have the ability to patch to

138
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:32,390
these products here every time you open
up your mobile app it relaxes go out i

139
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:38,150
will call the firmware kind of all the
spices and changeup and it's not tell

140
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:45,530
you see so when you're purchasing using
int technology want int technology

141
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,800
that's going to do that because we're
always going to find vulnerabilities

142
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,900
master can solve his problems

143
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,620
I'm hoping you enjoyed that the ground
time now

144
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:02,450
thank you very much
