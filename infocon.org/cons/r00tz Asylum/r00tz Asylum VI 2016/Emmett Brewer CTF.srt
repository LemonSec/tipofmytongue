00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
hi

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:13,580
about that life is mine home a fourth
grade and I like to talk and I really

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:20,060
like Consulate's 2014 is my first Def
Con for me I'm like everything security

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,430
jailbreaking buzzing sniffing and all
that other stuff capture the flag

5
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:30,289
what is it temporary flag is a game
where you try to compete against others

6
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:36,110
teams or individuals you try to get the
most points less importantly you try to

7
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,290
learn something you try to have fun
while doing it

8
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:44,809
flags are points from skinny simple
answer after Clinton's here's an example

9
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:52,099
what is the binary and for the fly to
answer can be the binary below 85 can

10
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:58,350
also be found or captured by complain as
complex task for example

11
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,960
you can be digging for a pcap files
packet capture you can be identifying

12
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,630
some logon credentials and you can log
into once I using this and logon

13
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,429
credentials and finally running SQL
injection against our base and tried to

14
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,520
obtain the black what makes a good
flight

15
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,830
I've been flagging it hard to guess its
unique within the game and it's supposed

16
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,940
to be long and random if it's not want
to lose too much can easily get it and

17
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,380
get points for it may 2016 is when
Facebook releases their capture the

18
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,170
flying framework as open-source it
supports both jeopardy 18 the Hillsdale

19
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:44,819
cps it's easy used mostly inexpensive
and it's excellent for schools teachers

20
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:50,580
and you can also use this for stuff
besides securities you want to tell

21
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,869

22

55
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:22,690
you actually make sure you have the
thing select as for me I always did

56
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:31,520
you have to make sure you turn on over
here a bunch of people forget that it's

57
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,378
on the most important thing to you

58
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:40,069
mostly everything you is has an on/off
