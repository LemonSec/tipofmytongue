1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,940
we're talking about food working i'm l
sessions primos and we're going to talk

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,759
about the amazing things you can do with
the search engine and so the internet is

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:23,310
all these interconnected web pages and
that makes up what we call have search

4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:32,519
engines flow like Google right we're all
familiar with Google think for all the

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,770
internet they crawl the web they
actually no more than just web pages

6
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:44,910
they're going to discover things like
baby monitors and home security and

7
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,099
other things if you have connected to
what we call the Internet of Things and

8
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,780
so the internets a lot more than just
web browsers but we're going to focus

9
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,870
today on what you can do with a search
engine to find things on the internet so

10
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:10,380
Google Dorking uses certain code words
to search for things you can search for

11
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,649
admin login pages you can search for
usernames and passwords emails

12
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:24,630
vulnerabilities sensitive documents that
need you don't want other people to see

13
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,670
or your company doesn't want to expose
on the internet government and military

14
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,300
data

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:38,320
email list and much much more I have a
URL up here you if you want to go see

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:49,750
this information where I got this mostly
you can go to is GD / google working and

17
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:58,480
so the syntax for the way that you put a
search query into your into google is to

18
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,190
have an advanced operator I'll give you
a list of these and then a keyword so

19
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,320
you're searching for something such as
maybe you want to search a particular

20
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:14,560
website right like website.com you want
to find something just on that website

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,640
or maybe you want to find a key word on
the website or particular file type on

22
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,059
the website and so I don't you can see
this

23
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,010
these are there are simple dorks and
there are advanced orcs somebody give

24
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:37,630
you some of the simple dorks you can
search for keywords you can look for

25
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:48,880
keywords or streams that are in a URL
which is the web address you can look at

26
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:55,329
the title of the page you can look for
particular file types like an Excel

27
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,840
spreadsheet or word document or a text
document

28
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,030
you can find things within certain date
ranges and so these are the simple ones

29
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,800
but there are much more complex ones and
so here's an example of finding some

30
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:16,629
vulnerabilities we're using the in URL
and we're looking for username we're

31
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:22,780
looking for files that are the file type
tht and we're looking for the word ad

32
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:29,709
and so we start to we can return a bunch
of websites if you were to put a command

33
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:37,840
like that Google of where there might be
admin passwords that are exposed so let

34
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,150
me tell you remember our code of ethics
right we're white hat hackers so we're

35
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,560
out there finding these things for our
companies so that we can make sure they

36
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,769
get taken down and the black hat hackers
that are trying to be malicious and

37
00:03:53,769 --> 00:04:00,250
steal information and be criminals we
don't want them together right so these

38
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,840
vulnerable vulnerabilities are out there
you want to find them so that we can

39
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,579
remove them

40
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:13,510
here's an example of using another we're
looking for @ gmail.com in Excel

41
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:19,450
spreadsheets and we find mailing lists
there are lots of places it could be a

42
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,820
church she could be a stool could be a
company and they might have stretching

43
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,560
up there because it's convenient but it
might have all of their members emails

44
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:35,470
and somebody could find that it sell it
and then you get lots of junk neon light

45
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,479
they sell it to marketing marketers or
the heart of the issue to steal your

46
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,789
password or your personal information

47
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:53,410
so we're going to have three MOS here
talk about tracking and authenticity on

48
00:04:53,410 --> 00:05:00,100
the worldwide web with a demo of how
people can find out stuff about you

49
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:09,490
alright alright here you go yesterday in
the word about privacy about piracy to

50
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,020
school like to see not to use your own
email address when you're at the school

51
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,640
be careful about when you're signing up
for things but sometimes you just you

52
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:25,180
can't help but get tracked on the
internet so just simply going to place

53
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,890
where your email later I don't want me
people have an email yahoo.com or gmail

54
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,870
but just going here notice there's a
bunch of things on the page

55
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:41,620
I'm not logged-in currently see right
here if I were to log into this page all

56
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,420
the advertising on this stage would
start tracking so if I were to go up

57
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:54,400
here and let's say I have a clock drain
at my house I need a plumber and I look

58
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,039
for something called Graham up father

59
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,260
why hire a proper something like this if
i logged in over here and I'm on my

60
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:09,820
computer at home what you may notice
rather strange is a couple days later or

61
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:15,580
even later that day you pull out your
smartphone you login your email you

62
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,260
start looking around

63
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:22,210
strangely enough you start getting
advertisements for plumbers you might be

64
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,909
an Instagram you'll get the same thing
the other thing that can happen is if

65
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:33,280
you're on a web page like this and you
have facebook in another page right here

66
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,280
you've logged into facebook

67
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:42,070
I don't know if you're going to sites
but Sykes have little pictures facebook

68
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:46,960
and they'll say you know your friends
like this stage they like the pokemon

69
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,320
page they like you know magazine we
advertisements and you wonder how how

70
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,670
did my friends show up there because
they advertise they send each other

71
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:02,890
information all the time and just cost
you may not be logged into one of these

72
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:11,200
sites doesn't mean you can't find people
how many people have an instagram

73
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:19,870
account is this public-private I just
make my public because i don't care i

74
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,990
didn't find people looking for by stop

75
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,039
there's my Instagram account

76
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,070
I don't have to login didn't have to do
anything here's all the pictures that I

77
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:36,550
posted i took this go over the while on
the roof

78
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,109
I have pictures liking but this is how
people can track you

79
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,780
the other thing they could do when they
track you is they can do things to mash

80
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,890
things together

81
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:54,640
that's my son interesting how these
things pop up so you may try to hide

82
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,919
yourself with Keating you have a cute
name in instagram twitter handle

83
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,750
something like that but your friends
they may use that they need link to you

84
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,660
they may put stuff out there so all of a
sudden your name is out there they can

85
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,730
still find who you are

86
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:17,350
so this is how colleges and employers
are going to search for you if you if

87
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,260
you put quotes around something that

88
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:25,800
it will take it verbatim this is my name
i use when the work and you can see that

89
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:36,120
i'm not a bulldog or general but but
there i'm on facebook and linkedin and

90
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,530
if you then put additional keywords with
it you can really hear it down

91
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:45,150
individual and so I think one of the
things that's really you know the search

92
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:50,100
engines order things in order but they
think is relevant by what gets the most

93
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:57,270
attention on the internet so free Moses
son is does a lot more on the internet

94
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:02,340
actually works for Instagram and
Facebook so so his name will show up

95
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,530
before his home but when you start to
combine things you can really narrow it

96
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,610
down one of the things that's that's
risky though let's say I click on this

97
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:17,190
um I don't want the Bulldog wanna get
somebody else ok so you can Wikipedia

98
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,250
for example is something that anybody
can go ahead

99
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,520
so if if you have if you have people
that want to pose as you they might go

100
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,020
out and create a webpage with your name
and put up their picture in their

101
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,110
information so that you can pretend to
be used

102
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:40,530
maybe go out apply for credit cards and
things like that so the internet up you

103
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,770
know it's very important that you
understand how it works so that you can

104
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:49,890
work use it safely get tracked people
can be of use your privacy they can

105
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,220
stick and search for you on the internet
they can see what you're doing

106
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,840
they might know that you're in Las Vegas
and so that's a good time to break into

107
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,570
someone's house because you posted on
social media

108
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,820
I'm in Las Vegas and I took a picture on
top of a hotel right so hopefully your

109
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:11,000
house is ok when you get home my wife
said she'll take care

110
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,050
but it's important to learn these little
things that you can do to combine

111
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:20,599
information when you're out there to be
able to find here find yourself now as

112
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,360
far as the advertising to try and track
prevent that from happening if you want

113
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,710
to do a search six you know you may not
want to track that's why you have an

114
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:36,230
incognito window and in fact right now
and this machine is running as a gas so

115
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,130
all the browser's history is going to
get expunged but that doesn't mean it's

116
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,360
not exposed on the internet it's not all
on the internet it's there so if you go

117
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,630
shop at amazon you have to login with
Amazon generally with your name and they

118
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:54,110
advertising have facebook advertisements
they have all kinds of other

119
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:59,450
advertisements on their pages so your
information tends to attract even if you

120
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:05,690
don't want it and that's just the public
internet the government on the other

121
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:12,110
hand they're seeing a lot more than that
little do persona to try and protect

122
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:17,420
that the tracking information or they're
grabbing meditate at retail there are

123
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,890
some plugins you get for your browser as
well that will help to prevent you from

124
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,760
getting cooked cleaning out your
internet history and prevent you from

125
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,810
getting trapped like that so you don't
go on facebook and tries to sell you a

126
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:35,569
plumber of for other things shoes or
whatever you're looking for on google

127
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,380
but also you know which is working to
maintain your privacy

128
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,730
clear your internet cache use plugin so
that people can track you think about

129
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,730
how you use the internet and

130
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,170
you know the Internet is a great thing
yeah where would we be without it but

131
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,439
just use it safely so thank you for your
time today
