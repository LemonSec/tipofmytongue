1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,070
I don't mark and I hear this every
single show that we've seen every single

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,969
phone number . doesn't just don't do it

3
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,910
there's the hacker is usually buying a
corner lighting fast we just giving them

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:28,019
enough pot information and there's 3d 3d
graphics on the scene and not grounded

5
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,579
in any kind of that was really the
motivation going into this we wanted to

6
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:44,940
do this right way really make it off and
one of the three more days using a we

7
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:55,530
offer ourselves and we don't like
watching I side with a hard and that's

8
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,309
not real

9
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:03,000
we want to show stopped and we'll
sizable to do the real me also

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,189
right-click a little bit more so really
beyond hiding Easter eggs all of the

11
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:17,039
show is wanting for some reason to
remember you seen ip address or whenever

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,390
you see a URL or hosting if you try
accessing those listed them you will

13
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,650
somewhere it will be

14
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:33,950
or his that will lead you down a rat
hole and there is a prize at the end of

15
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,660
it we did a little bit more straighter
than we were used to do so why are all

16
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:46,310
you were walking so to keep an eye on
stream keep an eye on size paper and you

17
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:54,680
do this to resemble I address or URL put
into your browser because it's just

18
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,240
great easter egg hunt

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,589
we put a lot of time and effort into and
I think a lot of people are getting

20
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:08,119
ready to take on it looks like just how
many so actually this is a show you can

21
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:14,870
hack who wants some appliances there are
no in it going

22
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,520
onion rings and together with crisis its
cool

23
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,600
another thing I just wanted me here is
the weight television show operators you

24
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,130
have a writer for the room look like
eight or nine riders locked into each

25
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,980
other pitches ideas disgusting story for
six months and how the circular ring

26
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,369
know about the story is figure that out

27
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:48,690
I mr. robot we have that same x mark and
I are part of the key securely so

28
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,370
essentially days the right through the
writers use the robot semi-nice

29
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:59,580
bothering these guys and we're coming we
have our own little hacking writers room

30
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,110
that's operating in tandem

31
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:07,140
where were his back door and turn into
multiple previous it packing scenarios

32
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,799
often portrayed your technology story so
everything will have you see on the show

33
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:21,150
is that often see people in the real
world not some ridiculous it's done for

34
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,150
dramatic effect at all

35
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:37,300
and so the way too many pics we'll
actually do in our house setting our

36
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,940
savings make it look like

37
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:49,000
so putting the right rising like a used
and the one product so those tasks see

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,190
have access to be done real well sleep
you get sent for more than getting out

39
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,870
of a to make a watch on nature until
after the elections work yet

40
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:12,880
it's an animation was actually real
patch tonight I like some kind of bra so

41
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,988
what it's all about that is freakin /
animation and it's like it itself is

42
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:25,630
like an interactive game where you can
say anything you want on board the right

43
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,310
characters will appear on animation
everything on streams example in the

44
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,360
original had that mark did I

45
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,539
remember completed while testing out the
real word

46
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:41,128
so the whole religion must go to their
with flash animation to make sure that

47
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:46,979
it doesn't have to be hyper average and
finding commands and responses show up

48
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:51,900
on string off active and this way i can
take an actor on this robot christian

49
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,628
slater rami malek consistent in front of
keeping anything loaded and they can do

50
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:03,300
whatever they want as long as they're
typing at right seen the right content

51
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,340
shows up on the street and one of our
White Sox it was totally agree with

52
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:14,638
later we'll do other close-up shots of
the screen and number two boards and

53
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:22,379
really gave me green details what we see
on the screen so i think it's probably

54
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:28,199
too late to text you have any questions
last the office any questions about the

55
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:35,759
show but you also sort of uncomfortable
so I work as an assistant on a different

56
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,870
us Asia called rush and I got cancelled
after

57
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,430
I was looking for money and i happen to
know the executives and the distance

58
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:52,040
over at USA Network want to speculate
they're taking me to lunch with sand or

59
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,510
just written classes based off of his
future help you the robot and about

60
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:03,560
Patrick and take you about my pass
career and cybersecurity so okay for

61
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,040
this is perfect for you i want you to
read the pilot and I want to be example

62
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:14,090
so that the pilot loved it and then I
Sam and clean it off right away and

63
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:19,789
similar what-what-what market i just
said earlier we usually on our mutual

64
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,620
same for how happy have been portrayed
in film and television up to that point

65
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:30,229
and we wanted to do it in a really sick
way wanted to nail the authenticity and

66
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:38,090
knowing that I could be much more to the
show this beings visited really so kind

67
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:43,340
of protein targets like the consultant
person one and it just sort of grew from

68
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,020
there and as bored or people who
suffered the show and the infosec

69
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,520
community discovered how accurate the
show was sort of getting banned it was

70
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:58,460
just for show that actors really signed
off on and no one's pretty to get there

71
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:06,169
any others up on words this thread and
they allowed me to grow team and I could

72
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:11,370
put mark we have four other consultants
some of which were at our panel yes

73
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:18,660
now we have this screw that's really
dedicated portrayal of tech see on

74
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:24,720
street and I was lucky enough to be
promoted to staff writer and technology

75
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:34,380
produces up the show that you're in LA I
don't know it but the other guys LA so

76
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:45,060
some don't post that took the individual
grains problems actually individual take

77
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:54,330
that answer is really like the team got
a couple minutes flying time to actually

78
00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:03,719
everyone bring their only take them and
its really great to see you and showing

79
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:11,130
right now I talking with my hands and we
bring back and SAT there

80
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:28,380
no less realistic and well I know so
what about you don't work I was rather

81
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:37,500
special live with them and with the ages
red active and exciting

82
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:53,010
no tell really something i was just saw
how that was like no one is watching

83
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,410
we're worrying about her training
something that's so realistic that it

84
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:04,350
poses a threat to society someone were
to take that information we created for

85
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:11,190
malicious purposes I price a don't want
to build we trying to say as authentic

86
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:18,570
as possible and this nature of creating
television co-related by time and we can

87
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:24,210
show every single step of the back so I
do believe should've accepted so our

88
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:29,010
don't give you enough information to go
home and take down in very appropriate

89
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,610
use a

90
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:36,130
do a little bit more groundwork research
and and their lot of factors involved

91
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:40,240
but we do try to focus on our remaining
sets we do want to hear the public

92
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,190
schools visually and make it so anyone
who's who has the technical knowledge

93
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:53,980
can recognize the tools man and get with
what we're doing without number five

94
00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:01,089
hours don't you every single set you
know and we'll be posting is really

95
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:08,529
strong as mine many got three daughters
on the phone and I've always hit they

96
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:20,980
are like speaking my fourteen-year-old
starting found you passed I wouldn't

97
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:27,399
have given is so I'm always forces and
make sure whatever

98
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:38,000
country and spend but i also found but
the selected our common x6 they're gonna

99
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:49,220
be about six months and that means the
hard part is looking to date so that

100
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:58,130
anybody not going to have I mark the
question is is there a way we can do

101
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:05,810
more engage females and an emergency an
in-place world and i think that that's

102
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,800
something that is very much on the mind
of the writers and producers and

103
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,740
technical clean of this show the hacking
group of society was designed to be very

104
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:23,810
diverse collected and some of the ones
that matters in that group are our girls

105
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:29,540
and I don't know how many more are
keeping up with you but if you send a

106
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,550
lot more time developing other
characters not only from

107
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:39,529
it's exactly anymore and we are really
more time regarding this anymore tiny

108
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:46,850
dog that was not the fiber internet and
friends and my hope that show serves as

109
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,829
an inspiration for girls everywhere to
see the street like a no I could do that

110
00:11:51,829 --> 00:12:03,260
hit final everything to kind of the
equation we are doing exactly gotta show

111
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:13,670
you girls and it looks so they don't
have a most hearty hey we want something

112
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:24,920
about power or you know opposite and
then their strength i'm using force only

113
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:36,079
reinforce really distance do this
message about submitting final

114
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:54,110
I want so they do not boring resent
those most diverse see great so much

115
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,380
one of the things they say about setting
a benchmark it's really hope that other

116
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:06,290
shows and films take notice and kind of
rise up to the expectations that i

117
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:11,510
believe the robot is setting right now
but in order to do that they are going

118
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:17,060
to have to put as much work and effort
into building a team like the robot and

119
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,670
really wouldn't care and research and
you don't have someone set up some you

120
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,849
don't have a whole piece that if we need
to bring learning ideas because

121
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,360
otherwise it's not going to happen and I
know that it's not really on the radar a

122
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,029
lot of proof right now and hopefully the
robot is thank you guys so much
