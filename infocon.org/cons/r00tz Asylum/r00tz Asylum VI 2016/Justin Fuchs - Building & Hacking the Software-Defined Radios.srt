1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,370
my journey here at roots and death car
and I started software-defined radio

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,919
about a year ago when I bought a soft
fine radio at DEFCON so you could buy

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,759
one here one quick disclaimer before we
start only have your own devices because

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,260
you can get in trouble with the FCC and
bunch of other government organizations

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,599
if you message devices shouldn't be so
you should definitely have your devices

6
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,149
and listen to the roots code of conduct
of course if you're transmitted so if

7
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,829
you get an estimate is transmitted
capable with this one you should use low

8
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,820
powers so it doesn't mess with other
systems or you can use a Faraday cage

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:53,820
like this one here this is just a bag
that's lined with luminol so no RF

10
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,340
signals can get in or out of this so
it's great for transmitting are doing

11
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:06,450
like any clothes testing software I use
ham licenses required for a lot of

12
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:13,590
transmitting and receiving but it's not
necessary but you can get that license

13
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,200
here at Def Con there's a ham radio test
plots that's available for you guys

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,049
top trend radios are like normal radios
but instead of using hardware to do

15
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:32,759
modulations demodulation is amplifying
traditional right decoding of signals it

16
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,909
is implemented in software so you can
use any code you write implemented

17
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,670
through software-defined radios and
tested very fast it's all the software

18
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,640
side so your host computer does all the
signal processing

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,420
so you don't need like a single hardware
for every new like devices happy you

20
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,920
could just write software

21
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,450
here's a diagram about how
software-defined radio works

22
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:08,470
it takes your RS hardware would be
something like the hacker ass or

23
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:15,010
something like the rtst yard and then
use that to do the signal processing and

24
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,470
that that outputs through your computer
or your signal outputs through the

25
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,840
software-defined radio LOL great way to
get into software-defined radios is this

26
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,450
really cheap . it only costs about ten
to twenty dollars you can buy here at

27
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:38,440
Def Con there are originally meant to be
tv tuners but someone found out that it

28
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:46,209
outputs raw data which could be used to
view the spectrum from these are from

29
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:53,950
these frequencies so it goes from 24
megahertz 217 megahertz and that are

30
00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:00,548
17,000 acres and that does a huge range
so punch your modern-day devices can be

31
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:03,700
hacked with this little dongle

32
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,400
if you want to upgrade your str there's
a bunch of open source projects like the

33
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:16,690
lime st RR the packer death which is
made by Mike Osmond and these are like

34
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:22,780
they have huge ranges from this one in
particular limas dr as a range of a

35
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:28,690
hundred kilohertz all the way to 3.8
degrees which is like a huge chunk of

36
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,910
the respective on this line is $OPERAND
yards full duplex which means a

37
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:39,430
contentment and receiving the same time
so you can basically packed everything

38
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,480
with this thing and it's open source so
if you want to even build your own as

39
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,780
young as believe the everything's out
there for you to do so here's the

40
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,840
frequency allocations for our on the
United States and this is a great

41
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,400
resources are like when you're getting
the radio spectrum you can use this this

42
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,230
chart to hopefully find out what you're
seeing in so you can learn more about it

43
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:13,000
so you can possibly a kit isn't and then
you can see the little circulated that

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,459
is the Wi-Fi band is just an example of
one of the allocation frequencies on

45
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:27,340
this is also includes amateur bands with
the hammer your license you can you

46
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:33,340
could do a bunch of stuff on there like
transmit illegal and then here's just

47
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,390
the Canadian 14 reference you can find
probably your own

48
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:45,490
countries allocations so every country
has been from social justice sample of

49
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:51,430
the Wi-Fi range this is the SSC database
so if you look on the back of a lot of

50
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,410
devices that has scid what you can
search online and it tells you what it

51
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:02,410
operates at do easy research findings so
some of the tools used for

52
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,360
software-defined radio one of the big
ones is the new radio companion and it's

53
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,840
a toolkit for soft finer you and it has
an easy GUI that takes like Python

54
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,869
blocks which you can connect together to
make but make easy to build software

55
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:27,910
which can be transmitted board the code
signals with your device's

56
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,920
software-defined radio devices and
there's a large community around it so

57
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,420
there's tons of opens the sons of
projects that you can try out here's an

58
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:43,810
example of the gy that can do regular
basis we got your the purple part here

59
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:51,160
is where you would drag your blocks out
there on your right side has stuff is

60
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,540
like it has stuff like demodulators all
that kind of stuff so you can just

61
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:01,900
connect blocks like any source like this
habitat for the rtl CR and then it

62
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,980
the great part of the bottom here shows
the maybe the errors in your program

63
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,040
which shows how it's running so you can
easily debug it

64
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,890
here's an example of a simple to do
radio companion script the top one is

65
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:24,700
received script which which takes and
Ozma home source and what it was about

66
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,650
some sources but it's the best yard that
uses

67
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:33,679
the drivers cosmic on drivers were found
online for free and it goes into the

68
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,770
filter and then narrow band received so
this would receive signals arab and so

69
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,150
example of that would be like this
microphone it was important in irvine

70
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:49,789
signal which you can receive with the
script and it goes up to an audio sync

71
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:53,389
what would just be your sound card so
you can hear the audio receiving and

72
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:59,419
decoding and then the example on the
bottom is taking a file source which

73
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:05,030
could be something recorded with your
str like for example for replayed that

74
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:14,630
it could be key fall but shoulders in
later slides and it takes a file and it

75
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:23,659
puts it out to transmit script that goes
out to sink and that that's what

76
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:29,840
eventually transmits the code and this
particular example would be used to

77
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,539
transmit radio station with its wide
band that's what the radio stations use

78
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:41,479
so you can use this to transmit your own
music on receiving on any radio

79
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:48,260
basically so some of the receivers used
by software-defined radios are she

80
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,479
corrects which is built why are built
with the new radio and can do

81
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:59,930
and as decoders like all the ones shown
here on this slide and it's a great

82
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:05,900
spectrum analyzer so you can look at all
the RF raids going around she lies and

83
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,789
here's just a picture of cheek your
accent it's receiving on a really low

84
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:19,789
frequencies so these things like rfid
signals so like things like credit cards

85
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:26,210
passports all that type of stuff and it
has the waterfall showing the signals

86
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:31,279
over time and then on the left it has an
audio decoder so you can use that to

87
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:37,490
listen in doing any unencrypted
narrowband or wide band frequencies so

88
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,110
you can listen to radio with this this
program or I can you can do what I was

89
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,519
doing last night in my hotel room i was
listening to the narrow bands

90
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:52,850
communications from the hotel staff and
use an example of a dipole antenna which

91
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,709
you can hook up to you

92
00:08:54,709 --> 00:09:02,930
software-defined radio and this gets
shows how intense receive or transmit so

93
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:11,689
on the left on the right here you have a
receiving antenna but you can see the

94
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:18,709
electromagnetic ways going to the air
and how it goes through the antennas

95
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:22,130
received by the receiver which is
represented by the all right there about

96
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,240
yourself

97
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:30,350
the other raise your transmitter which
is doing the opposite of the receiving

98
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:36,709
one so it's outputting electrons in the
air and housing ways here what's gonna

99
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:41,750
be received by any software defined
radio order anymore use this example of

100
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,570
a simple dipole antenna I made it home

101
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:50,360
this is optimized to receive a DSP what
you saw presentation before so an

102
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,580
example of some things you can do with
the software-defined radio is a DSP so

103
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:00,589
you can have an ESP base station which
can receive radius retransmissions so

104
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:05,899
transmits things like speed altitude
bearing coordinates so anyone can do to

105
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:10,339
codys with the software-defined radio
that's just one of the many uses of the

106
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:16,430
SDR like even just the twenty-dollar one
here can decode ESP transmissions and I

107
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,279
think that's probably one of the first
things people do we get himself in the

108
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,410
final radio is really interesting to see
planes going around you live an example

109
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:29,689
of some stuff I've done with Software
Defined are you at my school have a DHD

110
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,680
program which is deaf and hard of
hearing and so teachers wear these

111
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:41,689
little FM transmitter on the years and
the sole agent so the students can hear

112
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:46,370
what the teachers saying through the
years to their little their hearing aids

113
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:53,750
so i did some research with a sec and i
was able to find the frequencies and

114
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:58,760
transmits and receives on and using like
things like particular X I could even

115
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:05,779
hear what other classes were talking
about the conversations that are

116
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:09,079
happening just by listening to the
transmissions of the teacher had to

117
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:16,910
their little hearing aid and I wonder if
I can transmit on this maybe talk to one

118
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:23,870
of the kids through my software defined
radio so I wrote those simple script is

119
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:29,450
the new radio that is similar to the 1i
show to reform which transmits a narrow

120
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:37,310
band frequency and i was able to play
well i got i got one of my friends who's

121
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,800
a DAT program and I board the
transmitter from my teacher and anyone

122
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,930
in a closed environment so none of the
other kids were able to hear it to their

123
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:54,589
receivers gotta turn into my same
frequency and i was able to transmit our

124
00:11:54,589 --> 00:12:01,520
lab file so he could hear his hearing
aid and not just could be used for like

125
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,279
things like cheating

126
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:10,670
dear editor is so you could transmit
like answers you can stop talking

127
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,890
through a test if you want or you can
use it for he's dropping on some

128
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,899
teachers are any other narrowband signal
another thing that could be done with

129
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:31,459
SDR is a recent thing with pokemon goes
you can scoop GPS signals just to

130
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,420
display this is very illegal so if
you're going to do this

131
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,829
do it like in your microwave or some
kind of Faraday cage like his say don't

132
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:46,460
mess with any GPS signals that you
shouldn't be but yeah you can see here

133
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:54,380
you can soothe the places like area 51
or North Korea this example of here is

134
00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:02,540
in area 51 and another thing that's been
happening recently is keyboards with no

135
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:10,310
encryption can be decoded when using a
software-defined are you so using light

136
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:16,609
simple reverse-engineering you can see
the radio emissions put out by a

137
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:22,790
keyboard and you can write a code to
decode that and theoretically can use a

138
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:31,640
Yankee antenna and get the signals from
a whole office building of keyboards so

139
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,330
this could be like passwords government
secrets all that kind of stuff

140
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:40,310
another fun thing it's pretty simple as
he could do replay attacks to have cars

141
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:46,010
so this is just a a picture of me
playing with the sisters previous

142
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:51,980
because it has a proximity system with
RF and i'll just have my a craft my our

143
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:57,350
tail is dr receiving i was able to
amplify the signal thing put put up by

144
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:03,140
the tar asking for the key fall and
doesn't amplify that so if the key fob

145
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:10,100
was like a while the way it would still
receive the signal asking for and it

146
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,640
would open the door and possibly start
the car

147
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,210
the barrier to entry for
software-defined radio is so low because

148
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:23,030
you can even use raspberry five transmit
signals on very little palace through a

149
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,470
simple script found get home

150
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:31,210
it has a small range of low-power so we
won't get in trouble with them with a

151
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:36,580
little receiver like this and attachment
or making raspberry pi you could do a

152
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,960
whole range of attacks like the end of
the possibilities are endless and here

153
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,680
are some resources to get started with
software-defined radios if some kids are

154
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:50,170
interested so our telescope has a bunch
of projects and reviews with some radio

155
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:58,839
SDR audible.com board has a bunch of as
drivers and projects great spot to catch

156
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:04,750
it has tutorials with the hacker s and
we have to see ID . io has all the

157
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:11,230
information on a device whatever means
and the radio reference has information

158
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:18,850
on the radio signals being transmitted
in area and it has sources for all a

159
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:24,970
bunch of places and that's it thank you
