1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,240
this is really be talking at DEFCON
unexpectedly but i really wanted to talk

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,529
to you guys as a five or ten years it's
going to be you guys given the talks

3
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,630
here not made by should think about what
i wanted to talk about at silent it was

4
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,150
really basically what is it that I wish
I you when i was your age

5
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,730
what were the things that were so easily
true about the world that dance we

6
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,260
should just like sat down and told me
that this is what's going on at least in

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:44,160
technology so that's kind of my goal
here today let's talk a little bit about

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,660
other world review works there is change
between the world that I grew up in the

9
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:59,129
world that all of you all it and that is
my god you could just like get for

10
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,230
everything you know

11
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,768
used to be like kind of like an
obscuring thing to get the technology to

12
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,890
get the compilers to get that the
feeling

13
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,020
download whatever you need to learn from
and it's just not that world anymore you

14
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:20,310
have it all at your fingertips the
accessibility college classes are you of

15
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,409
length away in a web browser and it
needs to be that way if I need you here

16
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,930
with one realization one awareness and
i'm going to show you just how deep the

17
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:37,079
truth goes you go to school teacher
gives you some homework and you do the

18
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,669
homework you get a great you know you
did good you get a background that

19
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,119
eventually as you go on you go to
college you get this degree

20
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:52,229
everything is set up to make you think
that you need permission to be awesome

21
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:57,090
and I wouldn't tell you right now you
don't need anybody's permission to be

22
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:57,840
awesome

23
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,920
you can just go do stuff the resources
are there are there the means are there

24
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,250
and you live in a world right now that
is not actually based on people getting

25
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,860
permission to make things better but
it's based on the fact that people get

26
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:24,390
it was better and they a fabulously
wonderful businesses out of it he would

27
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:31,920
wait about this internet this thing that
we all use who would think that this is

28
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,679
how it had to be people have been trying
to build internet ever since the

29
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,269
telecommunication technology became
possible and you know what it took

30
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:50,040
decades people kept going ahead see what
we have now and be like wow that is

31
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,390
totally doable

32
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,569
let's change this happen

33
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:59,849
the internet we all know and love but
we're in charge of it

34
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:07,060
we are the boss we can build ready we
can changing and we are everything

35
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,500
and what happens that will get the
internets like that and they kept going

36
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,450
out of business they really did friends
had something that looked entirely like

37
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:21,040
what we call the internet it was called
mini tail they were the boss of it

38
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:29,709
AP gov billion euros in 98 it made a
hundred million euros in 2007 they shut

39
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:36,040
it down in 2009 they were the bosses and
then they will boss of nothing

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,940
we think all the Merrick online long for
all of your time and it looks like it

41
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,220
was going to be the thing that brought
America Online and you know what

42
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:54,220
what we call the internet records the
thing because of Americana and someone

43
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,140
needed write permission for everything I
know what we call this internet today

44
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:05,230
now you just got to fight you just got
filled now that didn't mean he doesn't

45
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,099
need everyone's going to love what you
do there was going to come to think it

46
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:14,140
was me use your technology but you have
the chance you have the opportunity is

47
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:22,419
open system this internet is based on
openness every other of these systems

48
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:27,640
you have to pay we call a gatekeeper it
a like someone who basically could

49
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,030
choose to let you want and then our with
take you off

50
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:40,120
we have sort of sexual system on the
Internet as well because it happens

51
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,810
technically essential systems are easier
to make function

52
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,290
this is all dns is domain name system

53
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:58,320
I'm very well known for my work on dns I
actually sort of part of it and big

54
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:09,360
about dns you'll excuse the pond is made
it really doesn't do much so this I

55
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,300
wanted to come up here and tell you a
little bit how the world really want

56
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,220
every Toby you could do stuff pretty
much not asking for permission

57
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,440
here's the other trick but how the
internet really works

58
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,960
so you've got this central authority
this one big thing at the center

59
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,270
it's called the route 1 by an
organization called ik everyone always

60
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,200
claims about it all those guys in charge
or so bad

61
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,930
listen to what they do because this is
key to how you see a lot of the internet

62
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,340
defending himself

63
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:50,010
I can't this thing at the center
controls all these things would really

64
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:56,460
controls is a very small list of names
and numbers and when I need small I mean

65
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,950
if you wrote tiny it would fit on like a
couple of page two tests like you could

66
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,300
write it out by him he's not big and
what does this thing do what is this

67
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:14,760
this thing says oh you were dark china
had a website in China you get here's

68
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,740
where all of China is not this
particular site not this particular

69
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,500
webpage about this particular line
detects here's the entire country go

70
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,130
over there on the internet

71
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:29,930
unlike

72
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:36,830
earth planet is just laying it's just
there whether humans like it or not the

73
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:42,409
internet something needs to established
there's Chyna there there's the United

74
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:51,020
Kingdom there's Australia something he
set so as soon is in the center has the

75
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:57,198
upper few you say okay here's where
something my Chinese is no no ask them

76
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,699
ask someone else

77
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:03,860
it's called delegation so you take your
a chunk of your power and you send it

78
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:12,560
somewhere else there why is this
interesting in the real world there's a

79
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,780
bunch of stupid people you might not
have noticed but and this is sort of the

80
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:27,138
traffic part sometimes there are stupid
people who get really really powerful

81
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:35,510
they like having your bottles so what
they happen to do it is if they want

82
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:41,300
something they just call up whoever's in
charge of that then you'll be like I

83
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,860
have been for your mom's please make it
so all pages on the internet and don't

84
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:51,020
like you're insulting you think I'm
joking but these are the sorts of phone

85
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:56,570
calls it actually happened and so this
is how the Internet is a

86
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:02,840
call-and-response this sort of thing
they think it's so anyone you could call

87
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:10,590
up to go ahead and do this sort of i
want this very specific change has

88
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:17,789
I'll be asking for too much you want
this page change in China you have to

89
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:26,310
mess with all of China all at once you
have to ask for so much you're actually

90
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:32,580
afraid to its design concept you make
it's the only way to mess with the

91
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,500
internet its duty privilege of dropping
a nuclear weapons and they don't want to

92
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,539
do that because that would kind of break
everything effectively many many years

93
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,860
ago we had something called the
Industrial Revolution and it went ahead

94
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,710
and made it so much smaller number of
people could build a vastly larger

95
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,720
amount of stuff it was just a
transformation of what our societies

96
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,740
were capable of you know we just kind of
75 more time just getting it up deeds

97
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:12,390
and now it's like 0.5% four-time who is
not a problem anymore now we're going to

98
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:17,189
go to other things the internet causes
then probably information revolution

99
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:23,580
where we actually started to be able to
communicate fast beverages get horses

100
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,170
organization done

101
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:31,500
it's the largest growth of what we're
capable the fact that all of you to go

102
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,900
ahead just get college level information
college level training just because you

103
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,850
have to be interested in it beyond the
level of a book but the actual detail

104
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:49,440
information is unprecedented in is now
i'm going to tell you something is not

105
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:59,280
good news which is there are jerks on
the internet and for as amazing as the

106
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,779
head

107
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:08,660
from e3 to let you go and do stuff build
stuff and learn stuff the freedom to do

108
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,850
stuff is awesome freedom to do stuff in
securely there's nobody who could tell

109
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:20,600
you this website your building is great
and wonderful and really humans but by

110
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,189
the way it's totally gonna leak
everyone's information back guys russian

111
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:28,189
no help you know

112
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,930
and as good as it is there's no
permission

113
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:43,100
it creates half an observation it happen
to you were all here at one of the

114
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,530
world's premier hacking how principles
and I don't know you know what happened

115
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:54,230
really is and I'm gonna tell you right
now our systems are built players

116
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:59,360
they're sort of like pieces that are
stacked on top of each other over and

117
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,390
over and over it to build up Indian
amazing constructions and then allows us

118
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:11,060
all to communicate and he'll stuff
electricity goes into basically milled

119
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:18,380
rock which called chips ships run a
particular language which we as humans

120
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:23,720
are really bad speaking out suddenly
these languages are made simpler and

121
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,090
simpler and simpler to more people at
work on them we getting web browsers

122
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,090
that allows download stuff without
having to do any work

123
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:38,180
it's all layers on layers and layers and
every other kind of developer every kind

124
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:43,160
of language year really likes to think
of their particular layer is how

125
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,780
information hiding they don't think
about how it's all really working and

126
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:54,890
how it's all really working together and
that is not us we is actually working

127
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,230
together system really works

128
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:01,220
we don't care how it's supposed to work
we tried

129
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:10,180
we see where things migrate fooled by
what is called the abstractions the part

130
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:17,140
where we look across all the systems it
means what we're trying to break things

131
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,790
we have more opportunities we don't care
which later we break wheels and break

132
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:31,569
all but he's as people out to fix things
people out to protect not everyone in

133
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:37,600
the world is it a software developer but
everyone in the world is now affected by

134
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,030
software there's a quote that software
is eating the world and happy music

135
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:50,650
software parking is the world's not all
packing is tossing it helped whole sure

136
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:58,209
is some of it is just people trying to
draw other people and so as all of you

137
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:02,620
get it as all of you looking at how
system really works

138
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:09,940
i urge you go ahead break stuff ID
that's how I got where I am I looked at

139
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:16,240
how things really bored it one day I'm
like 05 you this is this i'm going to be

140
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,080
able to hijack every email every website
I'm going to be able to break this net

141
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:26,400
do you break it you buy go ahead
understand how we

142
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,170
nothing works understand how it really
