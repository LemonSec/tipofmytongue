1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,259
great to be back and runs and it's great
to see so many people in this room my

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,780
first step is def not for spoken here
for 21 great years i love what I'm

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,100
introduced you're going to think he's
crazy but he's not you should really

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,689
need that disclaimer at this point life
but i still do you can some of the edgy

5
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:29,279
subjects that dress do require reframing
what you what you think and above all

6
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,040
what I want to talk about especially
younger people is how to think about

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,870
really tough stuff what you're looking
at there are genuine pictures take it

8
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,169
from an air force base of what we call
UFOs I just wanted to look at it because

9
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,510
these are genuine pictures taken at an
Air Force Base of what we call UFOs

10
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,489
that's what this talking about how to
find out the truth and who trust in your

11
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,538
search for the truth

12
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,129
here's another picture to show you the
glowing ionization phenomena a little

13
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,798
more clear this was taken in the
nineteen forties in Salem Massachusetts

14
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,380
by a US coast guard band

15
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:17,500
saugus out the window but it also may be
a reflection of the lights in the window

16
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,360
through which he was taking the
photograph so well that is in fact the

17
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,700
same external image similar to the
genuine photograph I can assure you that

18
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,929
this is a genuine photograph today
especially the more spectacular

19
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:37,060
photographs the more weed out today are
real because so much is able to be done

20
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,590
technologically and in order to
determine the reality of a photograph or

21
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:46,599
videotape you need to kind of people
i've talked to NSA and CIA do that kind

22
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:51,849
of analysis so the first lesson is
believing is not always seeing is not

23
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:57,909
always believing see is always an
opening to believing in something that

24
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:02,590
may or may not be true and the hard work
of finding out what is true begins that

25
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,769
it doesn't i want to make the point that
UFOs have been successfully debunked for

26
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:10,149
many many years

27
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:17,049
this is a genuine headline from The
Washington Post in july of 1952 now you

28
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:22,930
cannot imagine the Washington Post
running this headline today because the

29
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,389
whole subject of UFOs against the
reference to are they crazy has been a

30
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:34,359
cultural social and deliberate of
execution of a policy and plan from the

31
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:41,350
nineteen fifties forward so this
incident is very dramatic over two

32
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:47,680
weekends in July 1952 so many UFOs
appeared over washington DC including

33
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,350
over the cap

34
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,609
the White House the song and so many
people saw them just from the street

35
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:59,090
ground as well as jets scrambled 43
surrounding basis to pursue them as well

36
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,520
as on radar from two stations at least
if somebody people called the Pentagon

37
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,770
to find out what it was that it shut
down the switchboard that was alarming

38
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:15,740
because in 1952 the Cold War was just
cranking up and it became clear that the

39
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,730
UFO phenomena which was spreading across
the country could be manipulated and

40
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,709
used by the Soviet Union to cover an
attack or spoofing attack for some other

41
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:29,630
ulterior purposes including social
engineering and so a meeting was held in

42
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,549
1973 with you

43
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:36,710
US air force and the CIA which was a new
institution and others to decide what to

44
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:41,960
do and the policies formulated had two
things one we know they're real

45
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,180
they said very clearly we know they're
real too many credible people have seen

46
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,140
what we thought were incredible things
so we need to do the research that we

47
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:57,200
can from the inside but secretly on what
makes these go and where they come from

48
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,869
and how they operate the other prong was
to debunk are settled on the population

49
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:08,060
by ridiculing and explain away every
sighting which has been maintained

50
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,580
putting through silence for a long long
time so this incident i can show you

51
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,049
many more headlines that occurred across
the country

52
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:23,080
because it was news but it didn't stay
long because they use the media to

53
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,969
execute their policies

54
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,470
ok this is what happened to media
coverage you just saw Real coverage this

55
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,129
is what happened this is from the
National Enquirer space aliens drained

56
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:36,819
my blood and filled my veins with
mysterious yellow fluid is taking

57
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:43,000
steelworker and the alien so there
anything did that is pictured there you

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,949
can only see so many of these false
documents in tabloids and in the grocery

59
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:53,349
stores they sink in and you start to
believe the people i know in 80 who

60
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:57,878
study Russian propaganda have to be
debriefed intern because even though

61
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:01,719
they know they're reading propaganda for
the purpose of analyzing it they start

62
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:05,560
to believe what they read because the
brain cannot help to take it and believe

63
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,870
what it sees but news so . because you
couldn't totally discounted so you just

64
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,090
ignored and rejected these are for
people in the Navy observed on radar a

65
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,080
flying saucer which others saw with
their eyes and attractive group of us

66
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,940
got together to try to do some serious
study of this subject and you can come

67
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,919
up and look at the book later if you
want

68
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:31,840
it's called UFOs in government we
weren't 45 years to produces but it's

69
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,880
based on 50 years of research and
thousands of documents we have nearly a

70
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,380
thousand footnotes which you can look at
to see how their we were and every

71
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,190
single foot

72
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,840
points to a government document or
primary source there is nothing

73
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,950
speculative about the phenomenon in the
book is about the policies of the US

74
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,490
government in the nineteen forties
through the nineteen eighties and that's

75
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,480
the base within which we worked when we
meant to discuss what we were doing ok

76
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,060
now i'm switching subjects to biohacking
about 20 years ago biology began to

77
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,950
explode with the advances we've made in
genomics and evolutionary biology and

78
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:14,229
molecular biology it's a fascinating
field and just like computing is based

79
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:19,210
on informatics and his information is
coded information and incredibly complex

80
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:27,609
systems that result in us just effect
two twenty20 something chromosomes in a

81
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:33,340
single cell in an egg in a nucleus
become us this is incredibly complex

82
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:38,289
emergent property of the evolutionary
process actually young people as the

83
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:44,770
prices of doing the work have gone down
want to do biohacking butter mindset

84
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,630
Roberts of quantified self he did a
butter mine experiment he became

85
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,469
convinced that eating lots and lots of
butter because the vitamins in it would

86
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,400
alter his eyesight

87
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:03,198
wait what neighborhoods you see infrared
torching died of a heart attack so don't

88
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,080
meet tons of butter to see what it will
do and the first rule is don't be stupid

89
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,030
don't be stupid and if you don't know
what you're going to do we want to do a

90
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:19,190
stupid talk to knowledgeable people in
the 21 years and overcoming the defcon

91
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:24,949
everything I know about what goes on
here has been watchable by the smart

92
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:29,330
people when I wanted to investigate who
opposes the top-level it was joining a

93
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:35,630
team of the very best researchers doing
it alone is impossible in any complex

94
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:40,370
domain we need a collaboratory
environment like this number of years

95
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:46,190
ago dr. Pauley Rita and his colleagues
and members of Wisconsin it's really

96
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,510
important and wonderful studies and one
of the things they invented was kinda

97
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:55,849
feels safe felt they put magnets on the
back of a volunteer and spiced it

98
00:07:55,849 --> 00:08:00,229
directly into his nervous system by
going through his mind now the brain

99
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:05,210
will take whatever it makes you feel to
it and try to make senses even if it

100
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,680
hasn't seen them before

101
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,340
so what impulses it was getting from
that experiment or electromagnetic

102
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:15,320
signals that determine where the
currents in the Earth's electromagnetic

103
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,110
field

104
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,510
we're located and after time is he got
used to it he became able to know

105
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:27,360
exactly where he was always an
intuitively I just kind of listening for

106
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,640
that sixth sense that they created when
it took off the belt after six months he

107
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,710
felt like he lost one of his senses

108
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:39,060
you always know where to North ones when
you wrote his fighting discovered how

109
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:45,510
quickly and graduate the pass around the
city work because he loved knowing the

110
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:49,110
additional information that came into
his senses what I'm showing you is what

111
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:54,150
is now available pretty cheaply you put
that band around your leg and has such

112
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:59,189
as go exactly the same thing starts with
an experiment that sounds exotic and

113
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,410
pretty soon its commercial music that
rises it down so if you want to learn to

114
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,030
detect the electromagnetic field by
knotts placing it in your nervous system

115
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:13,740
but we're in LA and getting the
sensations that determine that and

116
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,690
allowing your brain overtime to detect
those sensations and make sense ism this

117
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,190
is now available to you so biohacking
idea

118
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,810
most is all exciting and interesting
things to do but you have to do
