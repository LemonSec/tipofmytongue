00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,730
hello and welcome to privacy in action

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:15,780
my name is Kevin Robertson I love cats
and candy law like we i'm wearing a

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,448
catch a little off penis and I'm 10
years old

4
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,449
it started out as just a school science
project

5
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,890
I didn't want to do any normal like
counting popcorn kernels or anything

6
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:42,510
close to that I wanted to do something
really unique so i decided to test how

7
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:52,110
many people care about their Wi-Fi
security this talk that i'm doing is

8
00:00:52,110 --> 00:01:01,800
about how i did that and the results i
got so there are some things that you

9
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,538
need to know of

10
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:12,240
when your app when you're about to
connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot you who

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,619
control those Wi-Fi hotspots what are
they doing with that information and are

12
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:29,030
they selling or spying on so we decided
to make our own and the terms of content

13
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:34,400
chance we made some no one in the
universe would agree to it to do this

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:42,259
project we still Raspberry Pi my school
sign of letting me do this project which

15
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:51,979
was my hypothesis is that more than
fifty percent would accept the terms and

16
00:01:51,979 --> 00:02:02,509
conditions so what is a raspberry this
is a raspberry pop so i got my master

17
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:11,000
berry pie and I used to can take it it
came with almost what we needed and we

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,370
have one so we want two more to get more
victims

19
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:26,450
I mean I mean data i use linux on the
Raspberry Pi terminal to program we were

20
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:36,078
using the command sudo way too much i
don't so a few packages that we use work

21
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:46,700
hostapd for making a Wi-Fi hotspot is Ed
HC pserver forgiving IP addresses to the

22
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:55,130
clients that connect no dog / to make
the Wi-Fi hotspot acts like a captive

23
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:55,819
portal

24
00:02:55,819 --> 00:03:04,909
bind9 to redirect website lookups to the
hope to the portal like google.com and

25
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:08,060
CBL see this is how it works

26
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:16,700
the pie advertises itself as a Wi-Fi
hotspot the user connects the device you

27
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:22,909
will tell them that sinus require it
will direct them to a nice and it will

28
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:25,909
direct them to web page on my pie

29
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:32,629
it shows a nice pretty page with a
button to the terms of conditions and

30
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:39,948
went to read the terms and conditions we
track the map afters of food connects

31
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:46,370
and who collects the accept button we
play audio when either of those happened

32
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:53,840
so remember this a kid a ninth-grader
got arrested after taking a homemade

33
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:03,859
clock to school and they thought it was
a long i have my raspberry pie and

34
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:07,350
chocolate from grocery bags

35
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:13,980
we want to think they were bombs a few
places that we want to test our Wi-Fi we

36
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:20,670
went to lakeline mall in austin that's a
picture and we went there on black

37
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:27,300
friday and Mother's Day weekend went to
Round Rock premium outlet mall for

38
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:33,930
Christmas and Mother's Day weekend then
we went to target four first of the

39
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,890
season now strengthened conditions

40
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:43,950
remember I said no I we made it so
nobody in the world would agree to the

41
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:51,390
most you agree to allow your connect
advice to be access and or modifying by

42
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:58,289
us in any way in including but not
limited to harvesting a personal

43
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,490
information and authentication data

44
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:16,109
now who would accept those terms and
conditions for people or two percent

45
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:22,530
accepted the terms and conditions we
went to be side san antonio and present

46
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:29,909
in this it's a happy convention there
were there were three tracks and three

47
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:36,930
different conference rooms i had three
raspberry PI's expect that not a lot of

48
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,039
people would accept the terms and
conditions there so that means

49
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:48,568
49-percent accepted the terms and
conditions now this is how I tied

50
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:57,780
everything together this like whenever
somebody connect it plays a sound or is

51
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:04,979
someone authenticate it plays sound now
I learned that people would rather have

52
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:11,430
free Wi-Fi finishing your connection
that people don't read the Terms and

53
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:18,690
Conditions and security professionals
doing just as much because forty-nine

54
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:26,069
percent versus fifty-two percent of
normal people now I learned how to code

55
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:34,199
using linux I learned pseudo which is
super user do apt-get install which is a

56
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,550
package manager

57
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:47,570
Nick nano which is a file editor cpmc
and audio player and how do and if or

58
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,969
else statement i also learned how to
research your problem using google and

59
00:06:52,970 --> 00:07:00,740
lead social engineering skills to the
website that help me do my project was

60
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:08,330
my dad's and it's
www.acuraofmontgomeryville.com rity

61
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,310
guide.com that's where i find out how to
program the reservoir kind of you a

62
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:20,390
Wi-Fi hotspot now remember this school
science project there i am really happy

63
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,960
because i just won first place at my
school sign spare
