1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I want to talk about online privacy

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,170
you've never seen the time are you
having been connected to the internet

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:18,119
your parents have I have but as kids
from day one you have never you never

4
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,650
get off

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,090
you have the right to have secrets and
you should embrace that you really

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,689
should think about what you're sharing
what you're doing you're telling things

7
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:28,170
too

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,660
don't just say that it's okay because my
friends are doing it or people are gonna

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,828
find out anyway think about that
anything you put online is going to stay

10
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,390
there forever

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,950
it's never going to get off you can
never fully eradicated you can't just

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,030
flip a switch

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,870
you can't just say okay tomorrow that's
it I'm done I'm gonna be completely

14
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,980
product all that stuff leading up to
tomorrow has already happened

15
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,199
so you do have a choice you can start
making moves to say okay from now on I'm

16
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,920
going to be completely private for a
moment to share things that I treat

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,729
social networks is completely public
you've heard that there's no such thing

18
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:11,580
as a private facebook or private twitter
somebody will get expect everyone

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,890
colleges employers to check your online
profile I tell this to my students are

20
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,939
applying to colleges 15 students from
our high school apply every year to

21
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,529
Princeton guess what

22
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,520
all 15 of those all know each other so
one person puts their profile online a

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,170
Princeton admissions officer can go
through and check and see maybe the

24
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,830
other people are there to go changing
your knees slightly which I

25
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:42,450
see a lot always gonna I'm not gonna put
my real last name i'm only going to put

26
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,150
confidence that's really going to make a
big difference

27
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,600
no they're gonna find we don't
understand the privacy issues now I'm

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,100
sure these websites are not trying to
steal everyone's information what

29
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,880
happened to be sure how are you going to
talk to your teachers if you have

30
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,580
legitimate concerns after you read the
privacy policy talk to them if you say

31
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,690
hey look i think there's a problem here

32
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,700
I'm a little concerned what can I do I'm
sure they're gonna listen my suggestion

33
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:18,810
to you you all have a school email where
you should use it use it for school only

34
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,720
we tell adults this use your work email
for work only don't mix them the good

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,470
thing about schooling knows that it
should only continue need so you've been

36
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,520
that don't give them your personal
information don't give up your personal

37
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,900
email and only got information that they
want you to fill out we were always cold

38
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,690
chill out everything check for the Lord
aster is required information from the

39
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,650
most things it's probably just turning
and email address in your age don't

40
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,060
check your mail or email if you don't
want to don't put your address and let's

41
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,140
talk about addresses if it's a school
thing if it's something for school but

42
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,220
the school address
