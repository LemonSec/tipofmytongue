1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:12,289
all right just double

2
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:29,409
charles is also one of the co-founders
and there's a lot of us here today so

3
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:40,990
the felder tough time will also be
joining us

4
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:47,530
tried to show a little hit us up this
you know what about 20,000 out there so

5
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:57,360
hopefully we'll be able to make it today
so this is our fourth year vs Iowa and

6
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:07,490
called on this is 55 but really for me I
do you get to computers to take control

7
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:21,759
from and social is this and what they
did to teaching you how to be what

8
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:32,540
happens and I love doing it and someone
you know new ways to make the world a

9
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:41,120
better clothes kind of like her one that
has been used a lot of way people think

10
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,150
of a thing I thought the original
definition just a safe place to learn

11
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:54,770
how are you today closed till ur having
her team here

12
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:00,420
lawyers that I mentioned before that are
then made sure we all stay out of

13
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:13,310
trouble but you still have the original
in-house you are know how people in the

14
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:22,079
world of the week you will be so because
you could travel time to state how many

15
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:40,919
of you have a great great responsibility
too so it's really important that we all

16
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:51,660
have that honor goes to follow all the
time here goes well for the company

17
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,010
you know it's not a quote that was
written for kids something that everyone

18
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,910
around the world

19
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:06,970
good until it starts with a lot of the
vote in the idea of its owner of a bill

20
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:14,020
from one of her notes for all time
living well as well as his 2d CIR the

21
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:23,230
Department of effect was it for us to
get them from the military within the

22
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:30,299
military there was on something pretty
regular that they will not result I'm

23
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,740
not alone

24
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:41,120
there's actually a lot that we can learn
from each other words like to do we

25
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,900
learn from the challenge

26
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:57,560
actually caught some challenges here
right now what you are alright what's on

27
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:05,030
the page and you can really get a feel
for where I'm going over here today

28
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:23,710
get that one of the challenge is
generally how are brought into these

29
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:29,810
different kind of boring you know so
what's the most contribute to this world

30
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:36,260
but you should be giving to all of us
because I think everyone knows from is a

31
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:50,450
genius to figure out what your DSi and
the rest of the world of principal meier

32
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:58,570
a little bit different and your offense
but the first one important difference

33
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:05,040
from the world is why I don't think
there's any borders anymore

34
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:14,740
areas between countries dramatically and
I think that's why things like the

35
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,810
drawdown

36
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,430
the vulnerable for twenty years everyone
knows that the entire world not just the

37
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:33,280
place for the power grid connection is
faster faster over time as the payoff

38
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:45,130
tangible connection until I think so
what you need to know you can do

39
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:51,000
whatever you want with the world and
actually have a responsibility to do so

40
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:07,060
times here too we are really important
first one is doing to other people so

41
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,830
keep that in mind what I always do you
think you're doing here

42
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:27,120
Detroit R&B really close to them over
here for a right to know about the

43
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:40,020
bacteria and so what's really great
about kids love them so there's actually

44
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:49,719
a tremendous opportunity here to 50 days
and vulnerability fifth when she was

45
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,900
nine years old

46
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,030
classes 0

47
00:06:52,030 --> 00:07:05,469
will hold a little bit over 20 years
with what we're still making her look

48
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:19,880
for someone with the typo or so you
finally the more I would love to hear

49
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:33,620
about walter here and so short-term and
everything we do here with everything I

50
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,890
do it we're talking to people really
important to have a positive out to

51
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:56,990
encourage everyone to be fun what you
want things happen to her first posters

52
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:03,600
over here in the world and also help the
world record for the military and the

53
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,280
women in the world will tell you this
alive over

54
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,700
their jobs and their relative to do
before they do it and if they think

55
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:25,770
about falling they all thought you might
think that the press actually will fight

56
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:42,360
for this loving community but also the
the makeup on and go as long as you're

57
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:54,860
likely to learn to walk like he wanted
to which is really a similar to the

58
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:14,690
world a better place to do this today as
well as professional athletes because

59
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:18,010
everyone has room the champ Tennessee
and pack them

60
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:48,400
nothing left for most of all the US and
the word gets around so these are the

61
00:09:48,400 --> 00:10:04,220
elevator and that's what's your elevator
really important that people today I

62
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,590
don't just go home and start blogging on
the front door to be able to get enough

63
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:27,320
so if it's something to rely on here and
it should start that's really all the

64
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:40,410
not so obvious one of the one which is
no penalty box obey the law

65
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:59,079
why you all know that the american slut
touched the ball

66
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:12,300
helped us with a few years ago we are
all cellular operator we built in 1884

67
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:22,609
the label is a little unnerving but not
Friday afternoon but we go home but the

68
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:32,150
$5 so because we want to do is going to
have a bill before they actually be

69
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:38,439
close but it was worth the risk

70
00:11:38,440 --> 00:13:28,920
not but that's what helped you

71
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:42,180
class people how to conduct their
research safely to their research

72
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:57,050
presented see very glad to be here we
hear both over to the contest area we

73
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:02,420
have a lot of our staff over at the
general privacy village to village

74
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:09,790
helping keep people happy to see so how
do I think of these things are being

75
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:16,439
taught you as well but check it out
there how to use pgp communicate safely

76
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:40,910
we also hear what you have to go out
there see you there

77
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:55,680
20 temporary restraining or sell yours
back in 2007 researchers jurors who has

78
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:08,390
covered the sublease Boston way to the
subway for free and this was just the

79
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:17,980
class it wasn't intended to the recently
students they could get a cheap and

80
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:23,330
equipment that was necessary in order to
replicate it is far more than the right

81
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:37,440
they want to show you the best transit
so they can you to death a presentation

82
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:53,889
you should be able to explain but the
MBE like that

83
00:15:53,889 --> 00:16:08,869
security by obscurity about it exists
but people talking about it so he

84
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:23,209
couldn't even talk about them and they
led into the court judge that the judge

85
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:26,618
short end of the stick it has been up
all night

86
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:35,049
available in case something comes up
temporary restraining order to

87
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:46,410
explaining their reasons this turned out
to be relatively cold because the

88
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,949
shutting down its debt

89
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:58,179
tremendous talking about other people
looking at systems page news back then

90
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:08,369
it was all over the media and sillier
text you bad systems to leave these

91
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:16,969
students we went to get that DRO lifted
took about 10 days which is fairly short

92
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:22,860
goes quickly and it was bad but they
were eventually able to get their

93
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:27,189
research out there they were able to get
to the place

94
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:41,630
me two years to help the NTTA figure out
how so they were good people really

95
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:57,470
think your talks here doing this because
you want to be her that's really saying

96
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:18,360
you're alright it was 140 workers they
did just that also have been sold market

97
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:27,169
for a lot of money that they're here to
you so try to make it over to their

98
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:40,659
looking for a while to get over their
love for not making it over here so

99
00:18:40,659 --> 00:19:07,269
until the first thing you have to
understand what's going on and that it

100
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:14,330
hurts the most important skills for the
future of the world

101
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:31,999
system here talking about how people can
help packing analog digital rights

102
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:50,519
activist you could do something like
that it's not too bad but with hang

103
00:19:50,519 --> 00:20:04,720
trespass to Property Trust digital you
get to a computer system that is not

104
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:21,559
your own and we think these are to take
some things which are felonies so it'll

105
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:31,330
push for reform to contact your
congressman said that you think that we

106
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:42,178
need reform and we need to have and we
need to have is where be used in church

107
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:50,299
with hacking for which is like sitting
in terms of service the department of

108
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:55,418
justice and serves his you but it was a
violation of this Terms of Service

109
00:20:55,419 --> 00:21:01,200
they said they use that order
