1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:08,230
being

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:16,570
with C overseas was most guys here girl
here and the men and women in the

3
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:23,448
audience really do with the number one
thing I need to get across is how

4
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:33,059
vulnerable and walk another myself
actually mad as the number one thing I

5
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:40,930
want to talk about is that those losses
have to go and see what everybody's got

6
00:00:40,930 --> 00:01:05,099
a lot of issues but not a single person
here and saw what happened since the day

7
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:12,089
we used to be able to solve a particular
individual that's no longer true isn't

8
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:35,080
today I don't know I think all the
pieces of its just we work as a team

9
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:50,270
it has to work as a team and composer
about today is composed of what we got

10
00:01:50,270 --> 00:02:22,040
yeah yeah we've got pieces to actually
different pieces maybe tomorrow they

11
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:34,340
were 2011 right now and there's so many
things fall just getting just the right

12
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:53,570
amount of components that make something
work and that's exciting thing or her

13
00:02:53,570 --> 00:03:02,109
keys inside a computer you have to hold
a home-building

14
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:13,230
baby do the rover is that we can all
work together to find solutions so now

15
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:23,569
actually going through this life

16
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:29,700
it's kinda period but it will get you
the exact same point about this together

17
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:41,530
as a team right now and how borrower
can't actually doing that right now

18
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:57,409
gather just mentioned the Jess the trash
the components that use computer

19
00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:06,189
computer driven machine components to
make it work

20
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:27,810
creative projects to build you a
computer that if you arm so potential in

21
00:04:27,810 --> 00:06:40,120
all the various components of ours road
contest because we had a long day

22
00:06:40,120 --> 00:10:10,450
all to see here people they're trying so
how about some kind of a more

23
00:10:10,450 --> 00:11:22,400
because in the end if we said

24
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:56,390
given that they are going to 2004
received this prize if you can explain

25
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:17,760
this process you might be able to
coalesce rowly just incredibly

26
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:30,410
interpersonal skills you need but in
2014 do that to me

27
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:40,910
so what's exciting to get it to load the
Mars rover and that's where I can I

28
00:12:40,910 --> 00:13:01,730
actually had gone with you i think thats
pretty cool I think to myself there's a

29
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:11,319
lot more mobile that's used today so I
started working like crazy people and i

30
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:17,279
ended up there is a former building a
software package that the compression

31
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:44,939
call even if she's pleaded guilty in the
LCO

32
00:13:44,939 --> 00:14:04,649
using the farm bill and what is your guy
and you can because talking about are

33
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:11,910
always in order to the radio station

34
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:44,099
that information in the malicious or
you'll understand the language which

35
00:14:44,100 --> 00:15:26,420
they talk between image so either way
overbuilt E

36
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:38,069
because again beginning of this home you
know only one individual is heated by

37
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,800
the phone

38
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,380
didn't want to but you can't freaking
tired

39
00:15:42,380 --> 00:16:01,050
multiple she will thanks to the security
check when I want to get across that

40
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:29,849
works and is not fair but it's possible
to hear how important this individual

41
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:52,589
and we just stopped over all issues led
reading up on may twenty she's just

42
00:16:52,589 --> 00:17:01,520
understanding that in this particular
tell all ya gotta understand how do I

43
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:12,589
get messages images might have two
messages from the other way if I have to

44
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:17,119
be able to get a few occasions

45
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:28,189
download a message on these are very
complex issues resolved and that is that

46
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:40,740
overall and say what I did is really
important because I had over that

47
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:50,730
doesn't work you have to be able to calm
which is so important today because it

48
00:17:50,730 --> 00:18:00,800
is just one piece of a much larger pool
which is internet things like UPS or

49
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:12,520
this or medical devices everything and
somebody tells you that somebody

50
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:23,730
tomorrow by hacking apiece and I don't
think anybody in this room

51
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:39,640
there and say we should all be worried
about your passengers are that's not

52
00:18:39,640 --> 00:19:47,850
because overall just like to say you
know I did a piece of the patient

53
00:19:47,850 --> 00:20:41,230
building their name or they're gonna
hate them because they understand the

54
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:45,559
implications of the individual

55
00:20:45,559 --> 00:21:00,100
for a while being cool and this is just
a part of the scientific problems can be

56
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:05,459
really easy to access the internet days
when you realize that there's only one

57
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:12,200
if you see something but they're
cleaning to do everything else the same

58
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,659
time then you know

59
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:26,169
and that's really easy way to say I know
better maybe I can go further and then

60
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:46,629
maybe you that particular maybe you all
may be communicating to carry out which

61
00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:57,709
would be an important area is between a
single home building and in a child and

62
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:28,629
there's another another concept that
very quickly and measure best one and it

63
00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:48,619
really fast when you get you have to
change you've really where we have

64
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:51,080
internet

65
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:58,899
we've got so many like systems to create
a mess of security so that one of the

66
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:10,399
things to create all day

67
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:22,129
design my day don't have parity

68
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:42,740
a chain chain like you would have liked
the old one link in a chain gang that

69
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:48,399
we've been using the Internet of Things
Systems PLC is things that which is why

70
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:57,299
I was able to hack into tuzla which is
why I was able to have as yet which is

71
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:22,590
why I was able to have to control on our
information and only one individual only

72
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,399
takes one individual to break one like
you too

73
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:31,420
as security engineer

74
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:40,420
it's the cost of a security mesh that
Sheen link that of security to people

75
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:50,100
who do you think you saw where your
hard-earned releases

76
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:58,500
houses improving our new generations of
readers and things of that nature

77
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:12,350
the more we see these systems integrate
physical harm or a true message that you

78
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:32,679
guys probably the most important thing
to me is for 2014 is really right stuff

79
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:39,300
just didn't think that he will be back
to where the train and other everybody

80
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:53,610
will get worn by running on it or what's
more understanding the models and

81
00:25:53,610 --> 00:26:09,889
continuously billing systems that are
achieved a measure or $600,000 engineer

82
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:22,650
so much to do that

83
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:36,550
chapter starts where anyone can see the
person doesn't think a lot of money for

84
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:52,690
everybody not just all everybody
everybody

85
00:26:52,690 --> 00:27:04,000
information crews really really really
get their hardware and software is still

86
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:34,000
going to see a lot more medially I this
time more about participating in the

87
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,060
game as many

88
00:27:38,060 --> 00:28:01,030
can you might have a lot of research
today and let us know you tell us more

89
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:09,210
about the system can't or won't fall
pictures of those systems within the

90
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:21,050
lottery and if you have any questions
