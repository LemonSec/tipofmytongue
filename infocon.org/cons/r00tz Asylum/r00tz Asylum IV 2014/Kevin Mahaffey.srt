1
00:00:17,050 --> 00:01:07,390
but as it turns out $1,000 that's not a
basic and then off the gulf war is close

2
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:17,000
to 9,000 still extremely rockets get
down to sixty $200 is still really

3
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,190
expensive you can see we're getting
lower

4
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:31,250
the chinese New 4103 section where they
can do about $3,800 oppressive going

5
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:36,760
lower and lower costs rockets russians
how they have a rock they can get killed

6
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,400
by mistake

7
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:45,370
32 and so if you were you really about
this you might say it's really expensive

8
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,230
to get stuff to stay is never really
gonna go below $1000 all the smart

9
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:55,470
people cry from I could get out and go
do something else but challenges just a

10
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,890
question of how to rockets actually work
and might say here's a good example

11
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:13,290
rocket its costs but I can live out of
space and the question where is that

12
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:21,230
money going maybe you'll actually like
itself and so you look at the fuels only

13
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:28,980
about $200,000 and that she turns out to
the $50 which is actually not that I'm

14
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,440
compared to the several thousand dollars
that it's no question

15
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:42,000
instead of saying it's possible to get
she likes to say say say well ok now to

16
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,330
do that the old you're not get rid of
only cost a few dollars how to get

17
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:59,560
$3,800 a kilogram 2005 to go there every
time they don't use them and so

18
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:08,270
companies tay-sachs they had a club
record as a rock and show you video and

19
00:03:08,270 --> 00:04:25,870
this is a prototype actually go up into
the air and land

20
00:04:25,870 --> 00:07:14,200
so everyone

21
00:07:14,200 --> 00:08:31,940
and so and so the receiver

22
00:08:31,940 --> 00:09:17,490
2013
