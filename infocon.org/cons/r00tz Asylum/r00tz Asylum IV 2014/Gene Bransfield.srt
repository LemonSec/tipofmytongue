1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,230
afternoon everybody my name is Jim
Bransfield and I'm here to talk to you

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,940
about the war key to weaponize in Europe
its introduction to him I am gene

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,290
Bransfield I work 14 St solutions and a
principal security engineer and angry

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,349
with me anytime as much time as you want
to and you can figure out pretty quick I

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,220
love my job it's great to get up and do
stuff you love every day and get paid

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,939
for it and people start hanging about me
in the same and tell me better job with

7
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,930
this would think that I don't know that
they want my job but the joke's on them

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,129
because they're never going to have my
job I'm gonna be the guy that guys like

9
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:38,159
on Friday before a long weekend and then
you come in Tuesday morning in there I'm

10
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,019
laying on the floor

11
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:43,150
don't step on that stain over there
there's the gene Bransfield memorial

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:48,250
stain so what are we going to talk about
talk about having a humorous idea

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,239
bringing that idea to fruition the
stories of triumph and associated with

14
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,629
that and valuable lessons learned so
weaponize your best Wang god's name

15
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:00,750
would you wanna do that well background
of this is a fifteen percent of the

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,569
world's Internet traffic is dedicated to
catch the National Statistics have the

17
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,639
entire world's knowledge base at our
fingertips we spent time on YouTube

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,039
locates and Facebook but I find most
tech briefings boring and I know mostly

19
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,829
people do and when I have to give them
I'm sitting there looking at the

20
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:18,210
audience and I get a little bit
technical people still over and they get

21
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,530
their thinking of juju beads or whatever
is so I just on a lark I started

22
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,450
including humorous pictures of cats and
dogs in fact this is the first 1 I've

23
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,450
ever used

24
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,689
started this entire situation I started
weaving in stories with the cats and

25
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:34,508
using humorous pictures of cats and
people started paying attention and I

26
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:38,049
get rather notorious for my
presentations to hell and I just

27
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:40,640
finished a particular presentation
somebody came up to me that they were

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,439
going to give me this cat tracking
collar it had a GPS component and a

29
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,908
cellular component would tell you where
cat was in a few were nervous you could

30
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,299
send a text message in which takes you
back with a GPS coordinates of where

31
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,350
your cat is well that's really cool I
need a little wifi sniffer and I have

32
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:02,609
orkut a working animals are nothing new
we have military dogs we have police

33
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:06,119
dogs in the AV really awesome dog that
jumps out of the bag of airplanes into

34
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,720
the sea and then we have even more
awesome dog see that guy right there is

35
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,540
wearing a gas mask the dogs wearing a
gas mask to the jumped out of an era

36
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,700
crafted like 30,000 feet that is an
awesome dog and of course here we have a

37
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,379
real Navy SEAL has been for a long time
using marine mammals in part a harbor

38
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:28,798
defense in searching for mines and
things like that they do exercises with

39
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:32,000
the real seals and they're like real
soon like I'm not real close gonna

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,150
attack Harbor thinking maybe I'll still
see all sudden flipper jumps out of the

41
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,370
water with a GoPro click got you
apparently every time they do an

42
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,049
exercise with the marine mammals in the
Royal Navy SEALs the Navy SEALs are

43
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:48,450
scared out of the water is really hard
to fight a porpoise so other research

44
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,060
efforts that happened is boosted kitty
this is like something from the sixties

45
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,459
that happened at the CIA and apparently
they had a lot of bad ideas and some

46
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:59,040
good ideas but they're sitting around a
table and a imagine this in some cases

47
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,069
ok cool let's take a cat and we're gonna
put a transmitter in his chest and a

48
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:08,578
microphone in his ear and an antenna
down a spine its gonna call to katie is

49
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:14,269
gonna be awesome and somehow this guy
funded I don't know how but it did and

50
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:17,840
so they were doing all kinds of research
join the first operational says they put

51
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,629
the cat down they wanted him to go over
there and talk and listen into a

52
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:25,858
conversation but he ran right out into
traffic in the end of acoustic kitty and

53
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:30,090
so that that project just guy defunded
not because they thought it was a bad

54
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,030
idea because the scientists are like oh
think the cat died I'm so sick of

55
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,720
working with cats I never wanna do this
again so it's really hard to work with

56
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,799
let's keep that in mind as we go along
so my stuff I'm gonna put a collar or

57
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,470
harness on a cat let the cat go round
and collected and everyone returns room

58
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,040
number zero is the cat shall not be
harmed I'm not the biggest fan of cats

59
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,659
on the planet but I am NOT one to
wantonly hurt an animal in any way shape

60
00:03:55,659 --> 00:04:00,078
or form is not just what I'm about
requirement number 12 catch will be able

61
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,510
to wear comfortable said stuff I don't
want to get hung up on anything else I

62
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,429
don't want any flashy lights going off
so the bird appraised up there looking

63
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:13,540
at what that blue light ok we all want
to GPS recorder waypoints as we go along

64
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,358
and we know Wifi scanner to figure out
what SSID and we get the signal strength

65
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,690
and we get the encryption algorithm so
that's my plan of attack so there are

66
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,370
other products out there that do kind of
crazy stuff like that Mr Lee cat can you

67
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,150
can buy it

68
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,508
a little camera that hangs off the cat
collar and takes pictures as it goes

69
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:33,380
along that track or garment sew
something similar but none of them do

70
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,780
SSID skinning for some reason so my
first plan was to get a gum sticks here

71
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,979
is a very small form factor computer is
about the size of a stick of gum and

72
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:44,359
runs a full Linux kernel on there and
that was really cool but is rather

73
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,500
expensive cotton candy is also something
that's pretty cool in the same vein a

74
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,810
track ship 3066 it's kind of like an
open source piece of hardware that you

75
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,240
can buy and hook up to the back your TV
was intended to do a PhD streaming but

76
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,860
Kelly Lenox organization figured out a
way to put a Cali linux image on there

77
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,850
and I'm like that's really cool but I
kept trying to do it and feeling so I

78
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,830
got frustrated i sat down I thought
about it say so I need something a small

79
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,979
form factor has GPS WiFi or cellular on
that anybody have any idea what could

80
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:20,650
possibly be a cell phone service in my
pocket the entire time I just need a

81
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,909
small cell phone to put on a cat cuz
that's a good idea right what could

82
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:29,750
possibly go wrong so now I need to make
an apk something to do so you know

83
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,900
you're driving type stuff like a new SIM
Android coding gonna be cool right now

84
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,630
they already thought of that is called
you can download it off the indirectly

85
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,699
store right now if you want to so we've
got a solution figured out now all we

86
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:45,970
need is a volunteer cat and his cat his
name escapes me and my friend reeves

87
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,909
owns this cat this cat is 22 inches from
the base of his neck to the base of it

88
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:54,840
still has a 20 inch chest and a 12 inch
neck this is a big cat so I'm not really

89
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,989
worried about putting goofy stuff on him
in his cat friends make fun of him just

90
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,789
beat him up so so now we need something
to put the cat so now we need something

91
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:09,530
to put the phone on the cats or cat code
would be good this fiske a coworker and

92
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:14,150
I looked on the internet in their new
coats out there if you google KACO

93
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,349
you're just gonna get a picture of a
girl wearing a coat that has a cat on it

94
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:21,349
but I figured the cat was big enough
that maybe I could use a dog coat and

95
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:26,349
get it small enough to fit on the cat
and here it is so the plan now is put

96
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:29,880
the tecnico but the code on the cats and
the cat for a walkabout and recover the

97
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,469
data when the Cat Returns

98
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:36,950
and profit so step one put the technical
step to put the code on the cat and as

99
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,280
you can see he's completely thrilled
about this situation

100
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,190
step 3 let the cat go out and then step
four profit right no well that's the

101
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,520
back fence he made it that far gone the
fence and wiggled out of it so what

102
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,890
could have possibly gone wrong here

103
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,800
well it's obvious right we didn't put it
on tight enough so you put the Technic

104
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,170
open the code on the cat but the cat on
another walk about and wait and wait and

105
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,880
wait and wait he's gone for about 18
hours people were kinda really freaked

106
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,050
out so the back door we here finally
here and you know and we open it up and

107
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,940
areas would like to point out the
configuration of the cat when he's

108
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,180
leaving the house and the configuration
of the cat when he's returning from the

109
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,640
house and there's obviously something
missing and we had a GPS tracker on

110
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,930
there and that's the last known GPS and
we went there and the coats not there so

111
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:29,260
so lessons learned so far cats are
really hard to work with we knew that

112
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,599
before you always need to test your
expensive stuff before you send it out

113
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,310
with said feline you're gonna need an
Amazon Prime account if you want to make

114
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,820
this project go any further and people
were really worried about the cats are

115
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,409
not going to do any more coat stuff I'm
gonna find a simple smaller form factor

116
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,020
with a similar capability so I talked to
my friend bill was a hobbyist and

117
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,000
technologists and he said what about
Arduino its small form factor low power

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,550
consumption it does what you need to do
no more no less and there's all kinds of

119
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,419
chips and all kinds of variety of
solutions I said that sounds cool but I

120
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:04,510
have one question what is it an Arduino
and it turns out Arduino was italian

121
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,469
researchers who is doing his graduate
degree said hey we've got all this open

122
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,360
source software out there when I open
source hardware and so that's where

123
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,200
would we know came from it's a small
form factor open-source electronics

124
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,590
platform lots of expansion boards that
the board comes with a bunch of female

125
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,159
headers putting up and the expansion
seals could put stacked on top of each

126
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,790
other and you can do all kinds of stuff
make robot's remote control cars this

127
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,680
guy used to test his spoon the freezer
receive it was still good this guy

128
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,440
created a robotic arm he put the glove
on he flexes him like that in the arm

129
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,300
does the same thing and then this guy
used to cheat on his favorite video game

130
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,319
so you got all kinds of stuff and people
make all kinds of expansion slots out

131
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,370
there so my ok that's cool and it comes
in a very small form factor good news

132
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,390
it's open source rather inexpensive
except when you have to keep buying new

133
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,660
ones because the cap keeps losing the
money or the bad news is sometimes it's

134
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,290
poorly documented sometimes it can take
forever to get you do depending on the

135
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,160
opponent you're ordering in there may be
it may not be questionable performance

136
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,560
so I'm looking to build them here in all
this

137
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,410
well that's great but I've never done
anything with Arduino I've never work

138
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,870
with small firmware small chip sets
before I'm not a professional whole

139
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:13,760
children and never soldered before he
said it's pronounced solder why do they

140
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,400
still with an open it doesn't matter so
don't worry it's easy

141
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,500
the great plan of a start of a terrible
situation so the plan now is to learn

142
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,660
some stuff better or do we know decide
on the most accommodating form factor

143
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,060
for the work it and put it all together
in a color for the win so learning

144
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,859
Arduino you can get it this Arduino
beginners kit comes with an Arduino Uno

145
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,830
and you see on there in the expansion
ports are on so I played around with

146
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,250
this a little bit I get the flashy
things fashion when they're not supposed

147
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,490
to follow when they're supposed to flash
and not flashing when they're not

148
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,980
supposed to flash so I felt like I get a
little bit more advanced to do some

149
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,360
research and he software libraries for
WiFi they got it for GPS they got it

150
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,380
needed for the sdcard they got it

151
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:57,189
create so feeling more advanced and
Jeremy Blum dot com at this point I

152
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,279
needed some more advanced training he's
got a lot of videos out there and all

153
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,080
stuff they put together if you're really
interested in doing this check him out

154
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,170
he's really cool I learned a lot from
him so now after all this learning and

155
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:12,370
experimentation I am an expert right so
I got a wifi shield and I went out and

156
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,610
got a GPS shield so plan was to get the
wifi shield working with printing to the

157
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,589
sdcard get the GPS working printing to
the sdcard combined the two coats and

158
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:24,600
get we're good to go through wifi shield
us it was pretty easy to drivers work

159
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,779
pretty much the first time messing
around with parameters and variables for

160
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:32,760
a couple days inns pretty much it
started working victory that was easy so

161
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,430
GPS not so much so a bit about GPS the
satellites are flying overhead right now

162
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,540
they're broadcasting what's known as an
enemy as string National Maritime

163
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,849
Electronics Association this commented
comma-separated value right here

164
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,400
starting with GPG da that's what they're
broadcasting so is the job of the GPS

165
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,290
receiver to take that in and translated
into a time

166
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,389
etcetera the boot up process with your
GPS in anybody's really need to get

167
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,750
somewhere in a hurry but didn't know
where they were going into was waiting

168
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,009
for their GPS thing to sync up you can
tell it's very frustrating he turned it

169
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:05,350
on and it doesn't know if it's in your
backyard on the other side of the planet

170
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,769
so it has to start listening to space
and get a lock with at least three

171
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:13,589
satellites in get their time in process
of stuff into the translation this can

172
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:17,079
take anywhere from two to 15 minutes and
I know from personal experience of

173
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:19,529
somebody's looking over your shoulder
waiting for something to work its gonna

174
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:25,050
take 15 minutes so the GPS deal that I
got was poorly documented which is to

175
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,189
say that it didn't have the appropriate
baud rate in the documentation that came

176
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,009
with the thing there is no doctor the
kit and I searched and searched for ever

177
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:34,269
to find out that the three the the baud
rate of this was thirty four thousand

178
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:38,639
eight hundred and this is like a week or
so of troubleshooting the problem is I

179
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,600
try to get an example for this reason it
def gonna now i cant not find that the

180
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,130
Padres 34 has made her trust me it
wasn't included in there so put

181
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:50,120
everything together you can see in this
particular big the GPS WiFi part of the

182
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,779
wifi shield is stacked on top of the
Arduino and the GPS shield is off to the

183
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,529
left

184
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:58,380
put everything together and I keep
getting this weird error about something

185
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,089
about 80% of memory is being utilized on
Windows all the time I just everything

186
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,569
works fine yeah if the Arduino chip
tells you that it's out of memory it's

187
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:08,990
just out of memory that's all there is
to it

188
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,510
the libraries and variables just way too
much for what I was trying to do the

189
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:18,050
Arduino Uno is 32 K memory the Arduino
Mega however has 256 KB memory so went

190
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,660
out and bought one of those and you can
see the size difference right there

191
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,910
still stacks very well may get a couple
extra ports but that together and couple

192
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,829
twists and turns inside and it works so
now I have a prototype a good thing

193
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:33,760
about the Arduino memory is a no no
memory which is no better and no posts

194
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,920
which is no better most sizes not know
better remember the cat didn't tolerate

195
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,339
the cell phones I'm trying to find
something that's much smaller so I went

196
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:44,010
out and look around the only thing I
could find on the internet is this or do

197
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,360
we know minute Megami from Jay Kay
devices and fortunately jaykay devices

198
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,670
dot com turned out to be a complete
fraud credit know that that

199
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:55,880
notwithstanding so I got the wifi which
is a breakout board here comes with the

200
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,680
headers that you can stay inside Iran
and put onto the breadboard their spark

201
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,180
or was another candidate for this this
is caused gonna do we know in the front

202
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,300
and wi-fi the bad kind of ignored me
know if you want to you and the GPS chip

203
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,089
you can see the small form factor rate
their GPA 3635 tea and a microSD card

204
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:17,160
for all the recording both the stuff but
the mega Mindy says it's going to be at

205
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,810
least four weeks before it ships and I
want to get this done now

206
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:24,779
other solutions are looking at are too
big in size too small and the memory so

207
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:28,920
I'm down to the spark core chip but
there was a shipping problem with their

208
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,540
their startup company there on
Kickstarter and they're very early in

209
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,750
the development and there was something
about customers in China the delayed

210
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,320
shipping for two months so I borrowed
one from my buddy bill so the check on

211
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:46,610
this park is is as follows an arm 32 pit
entry CPU it had 128 K memory just great

212
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,580
with SPI and i2c SPI and i2c are the
things the chips used to talk back and

213
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,430
forth can like internet for
microcontrollers did those things it had

214
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:00,569
a DICC 3,000 wi-fi chip on the board
which saved me space and form factor

215
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:05,330
Arduino compatible turned out to not be
true these to my definition which is to

216
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:09,230
say it worked with the external
components but you can't just copy and

217
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,640
paste your code out of everything you've
done before

218
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,610
into the spark it doesn't work that way
apparently season chip professionals now

219
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:21,250
this suffice to say I'm going to have to
start all over from scratch and I was

220
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:27,570
not happy about that but that was saying
this this solution is really really cool

221
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,430
it's got a dedicated group of developers
who are doing stuff and it looks on the

222
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,520
forms and one day somebody came in at
like it to do blah and some engineer

223
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,520
said thats cool and stayed up all night
and the next day they have cold up there

224
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,029
some nyquil this might work out in my
favor anyway so let's just see what

225
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:46,370
happens so library somebody posted St
car libraries on the forums and they

226
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,829
compiled for me somebody posted GPS
libraries to the forums and they

227
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:54,709
compiled and work with my shield that's
even better if I libraries not so much

228
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:59,310
because the spark or is an Internet of
Things device you're gonna be mentioned

229
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:03,140
that a couple times it bit me a couple
nights wifi is there is a service and

230
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,060
their plan of attack was will connect
you to the internet you do your coding

231
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,430
and then use our stuff to get to the
internet you not really supposed to miss

232
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:15,290
with their wifi but the Adafruit ship
that i buy had the exact same wi-fi chip

233
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:15,900
on it

234
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,730
that these parkour was using in the food
had their libraries available for

235
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,910
download off their website so I
downloaded those things in this is the

236
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,010
part where I tell you that you know how
Thomas Edison found a hundred ways to

237
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,250
make a label before you actually made a
late Pope not to make a label that found

238
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,650
plenty of ways not to make a color tell
you that but so one of the things I did

239
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,060
was mess around the area from stuff and
I found a good way to do the SSID skins

240
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,199
but since the same chip do you think I
could just throw it on there and work

241
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:48,510
that's impossible wait it worked first
time that's amazing I got something

242
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,580
working now so now I got GPS working on
the spark I got sdcard working on the

243
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,210
spark I got s ESSID collection on the
spark now we have to work with the tiny

244
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:05,660
components and that means soldering yes
anybody ever started before and loves it

245
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,959
hands would have started before yet love
it no no no soldering is my new least

246
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,610
favorite activity I got a couple rules
for those who are going to learn how to

247
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,820
solder rule number one is don't touch
the pointy part that's where the

248
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,400
harnesses rule number two is always
remember where you put the soldering

249
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,010
iron down and if you violate rule number
two you're probably going to violate

250
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:31,910
rule number one rule number three is
everything looks easy on the Internet

251
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:36,219
guys have been doing soldering for like
50 years ago you try to do it yourself

252
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,140
as a plaque over the place but that that
said my first attempts actually went

253
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,630
very well I was able to side of the
headers onto the sdcard breakout board I

254
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,900
was able to Saturday

255
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,350
headers onto the chip with the spires
they're so that actually fit into my

256
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,600
breadboard and at that very well I felt
rather proud of myself

257
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,870
testing at home everything went great
and you took it out for a walk about in

258
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,900
the yard picking up your neighbor's wife
by this fantastic as cool put it in the

259
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,280
car to go for a drive and everything
fell apart why what happened

260
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,790
well as talking to the guys on the
boards they said oh yes 04 power

261
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,750
consumption reason you're prolly gonna
have to talk with the wifi chip on and

262
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,230
off but if you turn it back on you want
to put all subsequent code into an if

263
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:21,480
statement and it closed status Eagles
wifi on this is an Internet of Things

264
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,110
device so status equals wifi on only
returns true if its associated with the

265
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:27,649
known why

266
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:32,000
access point which if I'm half a mile
down the road is not going to happen so

267
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,930
what I did was I try I played around
with it for a while and I realized that

268
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,840
if I just turn the wifi chip on and
ended an SSID skin before we waiting for

269
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,780
to associate I got everything I needed
anyway so that code from the clause and

270
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,720
now I'm finally working on it so
fantastic now I took it for a drive and

271
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,220
I got data back and I had GPS
coordinates need SSID and I had

272
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,460
everything I needed a Mike this is
awesome so it took it home and I put it

273
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,790
into Google Earth and I was driving on
the highway but it had me often a lake

274
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:04,240
trying to do testing from home and had
me half a mile down the road and Mike

275
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,000
what's going on

276
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,470
well apparently the guy who created the
GPS libraries did not do the new media

277
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,320
conversions properly and send out these
libraries that have been tempting on are

278
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,730
useless so I went back to what I did
before with the Arduino there's tiny GPS

279
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:22,600
plus plus libraries out there which I
really liked and so i'm talking to my

280
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,730
friend bill about where I'm stuck and
he's like oh yeah it's fine to support

281
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,470
the libraries and like libraries and the
way he described it to me is the way it

282
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,570
reminded me of my rocket science story
so I'm sitting in a bar 190 and drinks

283
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,590
with my friends in this guy gets in the
car in the conversation is pretty funny

284
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,840
guy so eventually question comes up what
do you do for a living is like I'm a

285
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,459
rocket scientist no seriously what do
you do for a living is no seriously I'm

286
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,830
a rocket scientist and so we thought
that was funny is that so tell me

287
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:51,169
there's a phrase out there is as it's
not rocket science what do you think of

288
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:56,040
that phrase is well I always laugh at
that phrase is it goes you know really

289
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,830
there's some science and engineering
that goes into building a rock and the

290
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,470
aerodynamics in the fuel and all that
good stuff but really at the end of the

291
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,570
day we put it on the launch pad hit the
red button and hope for the best but

292
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,620
sometimes it falls over and blows up
sometimes it blows up sometimes gets

293
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,889
almost a space and then dies and boys
open the hard part is not getting new

294
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:17,100
rockets the hard part is convincing us
them to let us use more monkeys the

295
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,399
money goes in the rocket rocket science
humor anyway that's how you port

296
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,030
libraries really you take the headers
out of one thing put him over here

297
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,840
replace the Arduino headers with the
spark hitters hit compile and wait for

298
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,840
it to scream at you and when it screams
at you you go over there and fix it and

299
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,980
then do it again until it stops
screaming and if the compiler screams at

300
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,410
you and you scream back you only really
succeeded in scaring her wife I know

301
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,029
that from experience

302
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:45,099
so it worked oh my goodness I have
ported libraries have never done that

303
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:50,899
before I was so proud of myself but
among get her so next problem now is

304
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:54,439
power consumption not so much how much
it uses but how am I gonna get something

305
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,710
that often encounter my buddy Ricky
he'll hook me up with this if I better

306
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,619
that he uses for his drones that he
flies around it's as good form factor

307
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:06,199
3.7 volt 500 million battery work
perfectly for what I want to do now

308
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,190
wanna test it and see how to best do
these things that you think turning

309
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,690
everything on an everything off would be
the best way to save power

310
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,899
the trick is though remember what I told
you about how long it takes for the GPS

311
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:21,629
to sync up its pouring 350 million at a
minimum while waiting to find a GPS

312
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:24,869
signal and if the cats hiding under a
bush you just never gonna find in burn

313
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:28,459
right through your battery so the best
thing I first turn the main chip off the

314
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,210
GPS antenna on and in doing that
collections every 30 seconds lasted four

315
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,609
hours collections every 10 minutes less
than eight hours and I decided on five

316
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:39,359
minutes customers is just didn't do
enough for me so now it's time to

317
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,918
actually make the cut our and all my god
if you thought sovereign wealth fund

318
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,070
these soldering is twice as fun as
soldering ever was I managed to tear up

319
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:53,269
some chips man had to go buy new stuff
and so I was tripling in my friend joe

320
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:58,029
is a doubly as I am and what do I do
about this he says yeah go down to the

321
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:01,889
noble Avenue local maker shock you know
some guys down there a shout out to Nova

322
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:05,629
labs in Reston Virginia Ted mad
scientist evil genius he hooked me up

323
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:10,149
with me how to do some legal stuff again
something that didn't make it to the

324
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:11,129
final product

325
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:14,320
Brian was my soldering to do he look me
up with the right side during iron in

326
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,479
the rates are made my life a whole hell
of alot easier so now where my makers

327
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:23,070
that we gotta make a caller how does
somebody does chips and programming and

328
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:27,119
networking stuff I gotta make a color
would like real cloths and stuff how do

329
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:33,178
I do that I got several ideas but what
we gonna do so I talked to my friend Joe

330
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,879
about this problem he's like why don't
you just go down to Michaels get a

331
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:38,849
couple ribbons and sew them together in
the empty spot in the part you put your

332
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:43,519
dick in there like okay so I went down
and got some ribbon leopard skin because

333
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:48,909
that's what in these days with all the
kiddies yes but now I need to sell I've

334
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:50,690
never sold anything in my life

335
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:55,820
sewing it's just like it's like a gram
muscular do that so what do you do you

336
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,520
see you get a grandma is my wife's
grandmother her name is Nancy she was

337
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,520
only too happy to help me out cause you
are frustrated I wasn't she hoped that

338
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,400
caller up no problem and so now here's
the final caller assembly we have a

339
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,530
dollar bill the e-flite battery the
actual color and the text that goes in

340
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,260
there and I wrapped it up in electrical
tape not only to keep the weather off of

341
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,190
it because there's some flashy bets on
the spark that was just going right

342
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,790
through the caller so now we're back to
our volunteer K

343
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:27,180
this is the cat that still owes me a
cell phone so we're going to send him

344
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,490
out with a test color first with no tech
and it just a bunch of stuff to make it

345
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,040
uncomfortable for him and see how he
tolerated it and the funny part was he

346
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,280
tolerated it fine all the cat people
receiving other colors too thick is just

347
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,790
gonna get out of us remember how it was
before he didn't look happy at all

348
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,850
checking out now is loud and proud in
charge of his entire neighborhood but

349
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,350
see that little piece of metal behind
his head that the name tag ring that

350
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:55,909
supposed to be on the bottom is directly
opposite of that is the GPS chip so we

351
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,840
needed to get something to weigh it down
so I went to my local region supply

352
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:04,389
store and he's a war kids so he gets a
bullet right and that solution works

353
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,330
fine so now the new plans that echoes in
the color color goes in the CAC goes on

354
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:14,800
the Walkabout and then profit so the
original results were nothing like no no

355
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,590
I know this works I've been testing this
for months ago not fail so I go to my

356
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:22,340
almost doubled over with my friends
reeds house and we tested it and the

357
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,570
color is working fine so what's wrong
and there must have been some so we put

358
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,340
the cover back on the catwalk under bush
in region I said down a couple drinks

359
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,740
twenty minutes later I looked over the
cat still underneath the bush cleaning

360
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:39,820
himself to read this is that your cat
like now and he gets up and walks over

361
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,500
to bush's like yeah and so he grabs the
bush satanic a close running off there

362
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,810
so we realized a new deployment
procedure let the caller sit outside for

363
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,159
five to ten minutes

364
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,970
get a GPS fix first then bring the cat
who the caller put the color on the cat

365
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,930
in the cat go for a walk about it

366
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:05,730
maybe it works I was shocked I was more
shocked than anybody hear the results of

367
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:09,940
the initial test run for the cash and
abuse kidded them for obvious reasons

368
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,050
but I've actually a buddy of mine
connect with me on the internet and

369
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:19,810
volunteer to do some visualization stuff
you're so good that I'd like to put out

370
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:23,960
the point out that I put quite a few
months of research into this project and

371
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,830
the first successful deployment of this
thing the cat never left the front yard

372
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:32,879
and those lines that are coming up
representative signal strength and

373
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,350
increase in value so there is walking
around they're not leaving the front

374
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,790
yard

375
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:42,270
thank you very much mr. detail but my
wife's grandmother was just like oh I'd

376
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:47,970
love to know where my gecko koko's could
you try it on my cat sure Coco results

377
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:52,030
that we have here and I'd like to point
out that we've got a lot of open and WEP

378
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:56,200
encrypted wi-fi access points going on
here this is 2014 people what in the

379
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,450
world are redoing their stuff going on
with Cox infinitive didn't want to do

380
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:05,230
that but that's a different topic so the
result of Cocos walkabout are much more

381
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:10,500
successful and their egos as he's
walking about you see his Roman all over

382
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,130
the neighborhood Coco actually caught a
mouse during this run he brought it back

383
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:21,320
to my wife's grandmother's house she's
like the lines again

384
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:26,909
representing encryption strength in
signal strength and there he is walking

385
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:36,330
around just sort of twirls and doesn't
stop there

386
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:41,720
so what have we learned a tech happiest
with no prior firmware experience can

387
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,680
create a functional work it's a color in
a short amount of time for all the kids

388
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,560
out there this is a real takeaway piece
I didn't know how to do this before I

389
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,929
started doing this I researched it I
beat my head against the wall i got

390
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,750
really really frustrated the end of the
day

391
00:25:55,750 --> 00:26:00,490
don't give up you will beat the Czech
because you are smarter than the tech I

392
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,440
asked a lot of friends I got a lot of
people to help me and it was funny I

393
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,370
walk into places I never been before
asking for help and they like what are

394
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:13,030
you doing and I explained it to them but
please don't give up you will eventually

395
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,840
be the techie will be frustrated and
you'll give up but then go back to it

396
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:22,330
don't give up in the end of 2014 they're
still unsecured wifi hotspots about that

397
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:28,210
just boggles my mind then finally cats
are really really hard to work with so

398
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:32,560
that's my briefing does anybody have any
questions i think im over my time so I'm

399
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,840
gonna wrap up and head over there if
anybody has any questions for me I'll be

400
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,610
very happy to talk to you thank you guys
I appreciate it
