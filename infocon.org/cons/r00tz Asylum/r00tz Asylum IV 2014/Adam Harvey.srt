1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:09,920
Harvey here to your counters designer
today

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:17,390
teach you how these are three
surveillance

3
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:27,800
have a little surprise hit to surprise
for here tried and later work I do

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,680
however Sevilla's

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:48,569
also artwork and design and photography
disclose where it's from a jewish is

6
00:00:48,569 --> 00:00:57,340
Pepsi is that a lot of people that
privacy is that

7
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:14,190
inside and this is a project he should
have a hair and makeup to be

8
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:22,750
sophisticated taste actions so we had a
very expensive costing millions of

9
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:29,750
dollars and then we have a tear in
making over $1

10
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:39,240
is detected in your face this particular
call the video Jones out there and it's

11
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,619
quite common and embedded hardware
divisions because it's a very efficient

12
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:59,410
at CPU usage and is active phase of the
project the death toll is how can you as

13
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:11,640
a human to a machine but still to other
people and you you want to the human and

14
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,510
want to

15
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:20,920
increasingly we live in a world that's
heavily populated by cameras casino last

16
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:32,159
night and so he said there were 3,000
surveillance cameras in just one on the

17
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:43,340
right side and now it's hot it goes with
them

18
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:54,269
genetic algorithm to attack detection
classify we're expecting a computer

19
00:02:54,269 --> 00:03:01,150
which profiles looking for and every
letter added another way for all

20
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:11,609
classifiers and is looking for this is
what's inside that we're looking at here

21
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:23,480
it's kind of a bold tribal makeup so we
do have hair part of the key things will

22
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:34,298
teach you block 252 jurors your face to
face detection algorithm which is very

23
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:37,280
cool project

24
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:45,870
camouflage from a long time ago it's
called dazzle camouflage and we look at

25
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:52,930
it pretty clear that shit is very well
but that's not the point

26
00:03:52,930 --> 00:04:01,310
the way that camouflage works is that
when you look at this area I don't know

27
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:15,370
where to show you don't go too far right
and so you can see who's the artist

28
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:25,190
Pablo Picasso painted with camouflage
being paraded down Street in Paris he

29
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:41,590
said that's being used as camouflage so
you wanna do see you can use that

30
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:52,340
actually so you made any part of your
face that they're really pretty cool

31
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:59,539
features like everybody knows that you
made it look like

32
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:16,100
wages for female to do they can be
created and create your own style

33
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:25,730
and that's what it's all about being
overly intellectual and creative lives

34
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:35,500
and get to the products I have for you
so you have to be thermal imaging

35
00:05:35,500 --> 00:06:04,350
anybody had a few things like on the
bottom of this and didn't see you later

36
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:12,550
metal barrier between that and the
camera and you can block but that and

37
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:25,260
you can see the top ok if it's available
like around and metal you can you see

38
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,950
that parks

39
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:37,300
what model are completely excluded that
gun black he is being shielded by so

40
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:53,830
they're a pretty fast and the show and
the tight round that he has a metal

41
00:06:53,830 --> 00:07:50,260
plated kind of like but it is low

42
00:07:50,260 --> 00:08:11,469
to know the story about it in the new
york times and they were pretty pictures

43
00:08:11,470 --> 00:09:42,400
where somebody to rate and see where
that person

44
00:09:42,400 --> 00:10:13,780
other type of surveillance video has a
phone on that right

45
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:22,079
your phone's location is being tracked
by your service here and just right now

46
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:32,920
everywhere you go you can if you want to
learn about security so they may have

47
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:53,810
and how to communicate with the tower
and the answer with a Faraday cage this

48
00:10:53,810 --> 00:11:03,760
year it was learned that had 52 metal
plated fabric your phone and it blocks

49
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,240
all signals to text

50
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:23,670
here it's a little bit small city friend
was collecting MAC addresses and looking

51
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:31,670
at when you have a computer security
vulnerability broadcasting networks that

52
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:44,390
even before and you didn't even see the
standard they fall through its market

53
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:51,370
can be pieced together all the important
bits of some of its life where they may

54
00:11:51,370 --> 00:12:03,990
be and how they've been too and the
other way to the physical coo clock all

55
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,810
the radio waves coming from your
thoughts

56
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:20,770
try this one get away in brightly
colored surveillance camera for one

57
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,910
individual to why

58
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:43,569
here a little bit fabrics that are quite
useful ok to tell you things about

59
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:55,420
surveillance and privacy is within
technology to carry out such as the

60
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:01,680
person in our Privacy presented

61
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,589
talked about in this same conversation
so in the end of the highest in

62
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:15,410
surveillance and privacy is the power to
selectively reveal yourself have

63
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:26,740
surveillance has the power to observe
how are we to be in balance so people

64
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:35,040
are doing surveillance with all the
tower and powerful to hear that a very

65
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:42,089
interesting statistic about maybe have a
little privacy we have and it's just

66
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:55,010
three people in the united states and
three seasons of your birthday

67
00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:04,740
gender and nation that you give up so
it's important to protect your

68
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:04,950
information
