1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:17,320
I haven't talked about are arriving
today we have seen by our apt to talk

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:38,290
from last year is the book is called
using super powers for R&D and previous

3
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:38,670
year

4
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:49,739
talk about sort of hers who got the top
of that is inevitable that works with

5
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,540
electronics doing things that it would
you expect to be done

6
00:00:53,540 --> 00:01:02,430
electronics do a little bit of that but
this one works on Wednesday please call

7
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:15,679
his tax purposes and it's all about
using superpowers like lasers and to

8
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:28,509
help you locate you wouldn't normally
just had to share the same thing every

9
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:32,570
year so early closing

10
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:41,479
actually do what you gotta do this path
is it with me

11
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:55,119
kids and always learn both want to learn
that you do that for me is how service

12
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,000
work for a long time

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,479
design stuff but now look at you machine
there's always something you're so let's

14
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:17,600
start to include pictures and stuff
around a long time we just haven't

15
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:26,900
decided to allow users when I was 7
years old which is a way back in 1982

16
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:35,320
computer which computer and it's a very
just started exploring using

17
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,320
photovoltaic connect to other computers
are very brutally for the internet and

18
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,810
just talk that he learned things and
discovered that a community was really

19
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,549
got involved in the Hatter

20
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:55,760
like you had a handful of people in each
city school computers and other guys

21
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:10,380
maybe there was a few of those being an
actor

22
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:17,490
around electronics and computers on the
TV show a few years ago this which i

23
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:25,690
think is basically the types of these
crazy projects and I think I have wanted

24
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:43,650
to know what time you saw it was sharing
with the world but really you know what

25
00:03:43,650 --> 00:04:00,840
I basically do people how do you defeat
and basically a share of people is not

26
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:09,460
people about this this sort of Sharon
because people always want to explore

27
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:24,780
those wanna learn that had to share the
things you learn with other people that

28
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,039
that's why we decided as good as I could
all these groups always had her clothes

29
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:37,880
off these hackers faces and most of the
world responsibility to make the world

30
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:48,670
better

31
00:04:48,670 --> 00:05:03,120
it can be triggered something and you
are so that is my attempt at being able

32
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:16,770
to fire people in the natural vibrations
of the house and shine like hear what

33
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,979
the balance talked about inside the
house that the government to do this

34
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:41,060
just came out that you can actually use
a camera shy and don't get back to the

35
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:50,890
south will cause other things to
operations but this is a test that could

36
00:05:50,890 --> 00:06:17,680
possibly be able to know something even
if it fails to capture

37
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,380
all the stuff that ended up coming at
you later

38
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,050
Professional Engineers

39
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:32,930
other life and it's a really bad picture
that I took this picture was related to

40
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:56,190
focus very well but this little service
that runs between the TV is on so you

41
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:14,630
can really tell my dad was a teacher so
I never figure out where

42
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:28,440
2004 so that is a very simple device one
of the first person I've ever made

43
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:37,630
headlines don't have anymore and it
wouldn't let you used to have somebody

44
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:55,599
tried to call into the house call when
are the police couldn't call to action

45
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:20,110
for real so we would get back in the day
when we knew this is this from the TV

46
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:39,020
show which is on Netflix now this is one
of the thirty 30 or 10 players outside

47
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:47,670
so there are no boxing gloves off with
accelerometers and check loans into are

48
00:08:47,670 --> 00:09:01,510
you know where doctors and stuff so we
can determine if it was Jack hydraulics

49
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:08,430
of these giant robot sexy stars each
other we also have our backs things

50
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:16,469
unless there's a reality there's a
thought they were going to do it it will

51
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:24,640
just be yourself before you do it you
can put it like

52
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:34,530
show up so that yeah yeah there's a lot
of using this kind of vision systems

53
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:43,650
alternate were over so we used to track
the left or right or backwards into the

54
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,230
computer

55
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:58,740
tacitly know the image and he's a change
to move the robot just the file but just

56
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:12,130
build the rebels just doing some things
that you can do it

57
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:23,720
your response should be honest so you do
it and you don't try to do not do this

58
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:45,470
to do something and this is my car or
the information or to do something to do

59
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:56,560
so at your house

60
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,479
yeah

61
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:11,100
hey how ya so this is this is this is
where we have a bunch of switches on the

62
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:19,610
trend here which is sort of the device

63
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:36,120
receiver on the same house were very
simple reason is because you didn't have

64
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:50,089
to do that 1024 1024 works for any
system is this you can manually go

65
00:11:50,089 --> 00:12:01,089
through 2024 anybody you know if you're
really good maybe a few more hours what

66
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:27,480
is a forcible typing system brute force
if you get this guy was like that and to

67
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:39,930
basically go through and I just held
down and whatever door opener that uses

68
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:49,790
militias

69
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:54,890
but it was fun to go over and chill out
there and you know we've been over there

70
00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:16,060
for the job which is the real world with
more than 20 the very kind of beer area

71
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:41,609
but this was used to play a song for two
minutes because of refugees in order to

72
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:54,850
get a good cleaning and Peter 43 bone
conduction

73
00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:15,150
years your job so that stocks so I was
really cool and taio cruz dynamite for

74
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,930
like two years ago

75
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:39,339
I have all their songs I prefer to play
it so I could just change the song was

76
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:50,149
taken a little microSD for who they
certainly doesn't wait while we never

77
00:14:50,149 --> 00:15:10,709
get to this point the bread or I have
said this last year that operates the

78
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:21,510
lady is changing to something else to do
that to you live

79
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:47,540
since you're at it like to look at the
security of information that people that

80
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:57,829
tell people about it fixed so this is a
parking meter from San Francisco where

81
00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:09,170
he had to go and buy as well but if you
go to the store and buy a $20 that had

82
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:25,079
your working on it are you so you would
start to the Peter and I have ever

83
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:43,250
before and I just did you get this far
are you dropping and listening to all

84
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:51,029
the digital data going back for the data
in the way that I don't want to be

85
00:16:51,029 --> 00:17:07,949
easily have what I thought which created
my own custom which is it really is that

86
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:14,380
the data

87
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:29,210
so all I did was found dead

88
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:56,289
San Francisco gay but that by the person
who made this is the moment they sell so

89
00:17:56,289 --> 00:18:10,090
I thought that was a mistake I came and
talked about how they did actually it

90
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:15,209
does work out that part says it's $50
below this story but they didn't really

91
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:26,520
know what is certain is that even people
and web design wasn't thinking about

92
00:18:26,520 --> 00:19:03,340
what they were about to show more about
the high-techs

93
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:23,560
to the ATM machine if so how is it that
there was a way that you can actually 28

94
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:34,040
yet lol online or over Ethernet because
these things all the time so he figured

95
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:46,120
out a way to them that close to the
computer that you can upload his own

96
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:55,969
programs to the computer at his own just
like it did you stop using your problems

97
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:03,780
that enabled in the BIOS password
protection so he did all this is also a

98
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:09,789
result of this

99
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:37,670
jack is sick

100
00:20:37,670 --> 00:21:00,680
so people would just go and see if I can
do it if we go ahead as a problem so you

101
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:08,440
don't get the banks are going to be at
risk so and we want to make the world

102
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:36,290
better way to do it is using that to
heart and go a little bit and their

103
00:21:36,290 --> 00:22:01,139
crazy stuff but there are closed so we
use those to look and let rise and

104
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:14,590
figure out who's going to get that
information as he can shove it so doing

105
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:23,409
recently so do many get access to a
problem

106
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:36,760
physically but also connected together
and sort of the layers and layers

107
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:44,379
between 34 and you can tell it's going
on but there's a lot going on this is

108
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:49,150
sort of an area I like to say that
source code

109
00:22:49,150 --> 00:23:10,840
physical electronics design area where
sixteen players are usually two or later

110
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:23,310
16 layer or layers of those are just
very complex right it's like to be

111
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:51,620
called show the right lady and I gotta
love it it is much better but there's

112
00:23:51,620 --> 00:24:02,168
always does well good show for all of
last year

113
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:21,799
to get used to dealing with getting
through that to get the proper use your

114
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:47,080
phone but they have really small things
and she's on this particular place this

115
00:24:47,080 --> 00:25:01,109
is what to do so this was a little bit
will be back for it doesn't actually

116
00:25:01,109 --> 00:25:22,699
four friends were so normally used to
create sort of poor people are things

117
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:40,789
like a briefing room that layer to layer
just trying to do with it with a laser

118
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:49,539
optical but if you want to see this is
it

119
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:52,940
game that's wrong

120
00:25:52,940 --> 00:26:16,029
blown away by doing this you know says
she's always telling the game before I

121
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:21,149
think something like that is very cool
and I decided to use it for the project

122
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:33,869
just because it was like six layers so
little plant back just got a really cool

123
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:45,668
design so I did that had an image of
patrol each layer layer layer draw so

124
00:26:45,669 --> 00:27:01,169
possible I was on a laser to burn away
all of the other stuff I don't know

125
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:07,419
what's gonna happen that's part of the
law that include any of the work

126
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:15,859
presented because it was a lot of work
but this is sort of work but this one

127
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:21,049
didn't work so I had six layers of the
search go along

128
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:29,619
was just a toddler number two we await
justice I never really got down a little

129
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:44,259
bit more boring than anybody that had a
pattern the actual so you can show the

130
00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:48,070
city and then we expose the whole thing
that hurt a little bit but it was just

131
00:27:48,070 --> 00:28:06,340
kind of a paris Jackson if you tell us
that more research and so what if you

132
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:14,350
use this thing called Tuesday cross
getting images like x-ray radio waves

133
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:22,509
going to your bottom gets out that used
for engineering stuff they're making

134
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:34,269
looking very good resolution failures
for the words or other things I'll see

135
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:53,879
what I really either you're looking at
the other side but this one in

136
00:28:53,879 --> 00:29:00,020
particular so if you've ever seen

137
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:08,200
epoxy vendors with exciting thing that
they don't want the users so I thought

138
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:20,870
about how to analyze promises but that's
probably a good thing that does a lot of

139
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:26,590
the door people think that there's no
there's behind doors were saying that

140
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:37,300
year was like well nothing's working in
there were never really go but in this

141
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:43,379
case and i said i want to know what's
behind because you're out exactly how

142
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:51,950
the board works three boxes and stuff

143
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:58,450
pictures about what does it all the time
it doesn't it doesn't let me see actual

144
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:10,230
integrated service actual actual glasses
and other types of materials and you

145
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:17,049
don't get it back

146
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:33,230
through you can see what does so that's
what that would look like that was on

147
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:44,659
which I could already see a person who
was running extremely well I guess

148
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:53,820
that's what it shows because she was
just so focused on only truck was

149
00:30:53,820 --> 00:31:04,330
machine question that's my job so I went
to this guy shocking sound waves through

150
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:17,570
it and there is actual class with no
hands coming off that this was a chip

151
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:28,779
itself to the service so I can get
access memory card data out of it and I

152
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:41,460
just don't know what I'm going to do
that another way two things you might

153
00:31:41,460 --> 00:32:00,999
not be able to get there you have it

154
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:16,019
bring something to go to the doctor and
they don't like bill collectors pulls

155
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:20,759
through your body

156
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:29,699
we do the same thing with extra trying
to decide whether it's a very tiny thing

157
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:38,469
or whether they just want to go to try
to look at the screen of the x-ray

158
00:32:38,469 --> 00:32:45,559
machine just a certain things and you
know that you don't really see how

159
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:59,099
excited we should the electronic to make
sure that you over the phone these days

160
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:07,908
are expected at the krome voters are you
teaching connections because all the

161
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:15,779
connections are under 21 itself and also
features of those are really hard to

162
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:21,079
work so that people are actually trying
to eat away through the poor and make

163
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:28,219
sure the markets are so they had access
to extra we have access to go to these

164
00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:30,470
places

165
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:47,380
I just had to put towards it also looks
like she just had a giant chamber inside

166
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:57,780
their body control turns on the X-rated
hashers sometimes the materials or extra

167
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:07,690
to be good to see that we're gonna do it
one of the things I was working on is

168
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:18,409
figuring out ways of getting access to
certain players individual their work so

169
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:28,960
they have to do is see if I can get an
extra blanket device so that when you

170
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:38,399
use your credit card to the store so
they have to tell you to do with this is

171
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:50,009
one of the schools are in there that
didn't look so good service he like a

172
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:58,869
lot of stuff basically was four layers
of his base exactly go with design but

173
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:07,589
they were trying to be like the security
so you have to create through get down

174
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:12,720
to the local search so I was happy

175
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:20,680
figure out how that works and its if I
think somehow try to do the best that

176
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:30,770
this is a really surprised at what was
inside or out where to go through that

177
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:51,960
is a picture of me I have plans for kids
it's really small thing about being open

178
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:59,910
to devices iPhones are open and close
their old stuff don't overstep that

179
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:13,399
you're being destructive to go to see if
there's any area that you might want to

180
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:34,940
go out just using technology to get
around that most people don't get a

181
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:45,119
chance to figure out what's going on so
that we have a lot to do two dimensional

182
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,040
x-rays showed pictures of two lots of
x-ray images and then lost the cuter

183
00:36:51,040 --> 00:37:08,170
processing and back to basically give
you three super super cool places to

184
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:22,830
check out other software and every other
guy also block over everybody has a

185
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:39,040
square head so you see that movie was
over the image and 360

186
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:46,000
features lots of back-to-back get a look
at the different images layers of the

187
00:37:46,000 --> 00:38:00,630
doors down through this region later
start to see what happens fast as a top

188
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:14,180
layer layer of the border so that we can
see

189
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:27,970
at all that would be like we're worse
it's like just knowing what's going on

190
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:41,450
that I do anything physical with people
who design service for all the time

191
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:55,350
our community by pictures are actual
design looks like

192
00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:07,220
designed like a bit like saying you
don't look at the difference less than

193
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:18,750
the border and that's how do we know
each other computer changing out of the

194
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,670
changing but it'll be a little different
layers and you can start straightening

195
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:28,680
things out see how they connect will you
learn about ecology figure out what

196
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:39,810
those chips are prob works and then you
can go a lot more

197
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:57,770
you know John Boehner have no computer
here you go

198
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:14,580
maybe your school's going on inside the
service at the church built with opening

199
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:19,910
things up to see what's inside just
about that we want to do is just got a

200
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:28,589
lot of things just like I don't know
what's gonna happen when I put myself in

201
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:45,570
that process of learning experience bill
that's okay that's part of town where

202
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:59,820
did that never too late to start out a
lot to the resources to really try to

203
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:05,970
fill gaps are good that's a really fun
for kids you got to build projects with

204
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:24,290
stackable workplace don't be afraid to
break things so we ask questions if you

205
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,308
have any questions

206
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:43,210
other things

207
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:51,859
products get smaller and smaller get
smaller and smaller and more and more

208
00:41:51,859 --> 00:42:06,740
stuff and he did so with the stuff but a
lot of time thinking about how to have

209
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:11,830
weakened the product so it just changes
changes the tools but it does jar
