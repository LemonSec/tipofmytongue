and you guys go back to eat but anyway

105
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:07,440
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> definition of a hacker you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

106
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:12,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">always like to to talk about hackers</font>

107
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,829
because they you know there are used in

108
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the definition should say is using</font>

109
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,000
multiple ways and a lot of times

110
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,880
immediate will portray a hacker as a bad

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,669
guy or a bad girl or bad woman breaking

112
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different systems and while that</font>

113
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:26,710
definition is somewhat true today the

114
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,539
original

115
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,568
definition was much different<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

116
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:33,400
really folks who were curious people

117
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:35,410
that wanted to explore computers and

118
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,258
really understand how they work and

119
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,940
there's a few notable<font color="#CCCCCC"> folks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

120
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:41,889
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through a little bit but so</font>

121
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,740
now we've got a situation where hacker

122
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:46,509
was originally good as<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a term and</font>

123
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,009
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this concept now of white</font>

124
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:49,930
hat<font color="#E5E5E5"> black hat hackers and that's really</font>

125
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:52,509
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to dive into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

126
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:55,000
there's multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> paths</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can go</font>

127
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:57,130
down and I just wanted to go through

build blue boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and blue boxes used to</font>

137
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,049
basically allow you to put up a little

139
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,259
button and it would actually make the

140
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,719
sound of a quarter going into the phone

141
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:30,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">may be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to make a free phone call</font>

142
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,130
well they used to build them and then

143
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,750
they used to sell them so ultimately you

144
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,759
know these are really good guys but they

145
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,380
start off being super curious and and

146
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,479
building these sort of things

so he's what i would consider you know

sense where they were curious

157
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,880
it was a problem and they decided to

158
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,710
solve it there's some other folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

190
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,060
is you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go down the path of</font>

191
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,370
some of these folks because it's easy to

192
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,440
get sucked into breaking into computers

193
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">& and not necessarily doing the right</font>

194
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,830
thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> albert gonzalez started writing</font>

202
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,730
laundry list of<font color="#CCCCCC"> big attacks that he was</font>

203
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,560
associated with and ultimately what

204
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,800
happened was the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> caught him</font>

205
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,440
and said you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to jail unless</font>

206
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,390
you work for us and they sent him back

207
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,100
into the field to go try to recruit

208
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,740
other hackers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get more</font>

209
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,870
information on them and ultimately he

210
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,000
became a bad hacker again so<font color="#CCCCCC"> he flipped</font>

211
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,980
and then they had a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> rested so</font>

212
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,590
he's a guy that's got himself a lot of

213
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:08,470
trouble<font color="#E5E5E5"> and unfortunately ended up in</font>

214
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:10,359
the wrong path<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a pretty obvious</font>

215
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,760
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a little bit of a different</font>

216
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,980
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is one that I really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wanna</font>

217
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:19,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to drive home with you guys</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">your friends relatives</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mom dad sisters</font>

220
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,330
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> in jail after hacking his wife's</font>

221
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,190
email<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you would think it's his</font>

222
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:29,140
wife's email<font color="#E5E5E5"> why should go to jail well</font>

223
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,570
actually went to jail for hacking his

224
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:34,240
wife's email so it seems like a simple

225
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:37,030
thing you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be fun it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

226
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,400
cute but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're ramifications for these</font>

227
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,959
activities and again you just need to

228
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,459
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's in balancing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

229
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,320
isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> in balance</font>

230
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:48,280
so let me talk a little about the cool

231
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,710
stuff white<font color="#E5E5E5"> hat black hat hacking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I got</font>

232
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,180
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> into penetration testing before</font>

233
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,710
was you know really even call that

234
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's why i wrote the book your</font>

235
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">notebook</font>

236
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">south</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to help people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a big</font>

237
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:01,959
industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you have software engineers</font>

238
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:03,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have now where researchers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at our</font>

239
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,750
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a lot of folks that</font>

240
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,189
actually look at the malware viruses

241
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that are out there and they</font>

242
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">researched them they understand how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

243
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:11,380
work and they break them down<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's</font>

244
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,709
a tremendous amount of opportunity

245
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:17,019
within the security space<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you focus</font>

246
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:18,790
your efforts<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the white hat guys get</font>

247
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:21,370
to go get to do cool things without

248
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,870
going to jail that's the fun part

249
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,610
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to reinforce here is you</font>

250
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,709
actually get to do the same sort of

251
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,720
things that the bad guys do<font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't</font>

252
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:30,819
go to jail for it which is a really cool

253
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,399
thing right you get to break into

254
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:36,339
computers<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get to chase the bad guys</font>

255
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:38,620
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get to reverse engineer the</font>

256
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:40,540
malware figure out how it works and you

257
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,459
know cause them some pain and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in what</font>

258
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,980
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me give you a kind</font>

259
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:48,670
of a fun thing that we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of the</font>

260
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:51,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">areas i spent a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of my time on how</font>

261
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:54,160
many folks here<font color="#CCCCCC"> of and I heard about all</font>

262
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,110
the hacking in from<font color="#E5E5E5"> China right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

263
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">heard all about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not only</font>

264
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">China</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got Middle East and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

265
00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:01,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">other places outside the US</font>

266
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,430
so one of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

267
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,610
daily basis of my company CrowdStrike is

268
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:09,160
we actually track the bad guys from

269
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:13,750
where they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we track a group of</font>

270
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:16,839
about 30 different groups in<font color="#CCCCCC"> china by</font>

271
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,189
name<font color="#CCCCCC"> right by campaign depends on the</font>

272
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,670
particular group they might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> hitting</font>

273
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:23,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies like Google and Amazon and</font>

274
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,420
Intel they might be hitting banks and

275
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,040
oil companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we actually go through</font>

276
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,750
the trouble of tracking them down so we

277
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,459
understand who they are what they're

278
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,800
doing we actually have pictures on them

279
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:34,779
and we track their<font color="#CCCCCC"> behavior</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

280
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,370
can protect other companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

281
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:41,800
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the US</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and US government</font>

282
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:44,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">you a question that's that's a great</font>

283
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,849
question once we find<font color="#E5E5E5"> them what do we do</font>

284
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,139
well if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> report them to the</font>

285
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,759
government of<font color="#CCCCCC"> china the chinese</font>

286
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:51,160
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> wouldn't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do anything</font>

287
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:52,870
about it so it's a little less important

288
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,639
about reporting them<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately</font>

289
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's not a lot you can do they're</font>

290
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">outside the US but generally what we do</font>

291
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,160
is if you think about a bank<font color="#E5E5E5"> robbery</font>

292
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:02,800
bank robber has a certain way they

293
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,809
operate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we want to understand how</font>

294
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">what their motive operation is so that</font>

295
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:07,540
we can protect other customers from

296
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,920
getting broken

297
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">too so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why we track these guys</font>

298
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,259
and ultimately there's not a lot you can

299
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,000
do from a legal perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they're</font>

300
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:18,250
outside the US and certain certain

301
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,860
countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's a great question</font>

302
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,829
so we track other folks<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Iran India</font>

303
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">and other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> places and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

304
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:27,790
made some shirts up with all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

305
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,360
funny names<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit hard to</font>

306
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:34,990
read but we have names like a panda

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:38,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">karma</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> panda radio panda these these are</font>

make this up we have funny research is

312
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,620
that that make all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> knees up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but in</font>

313
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,880
case that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> wearing a shirt which is</font>

314
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,199
one of the actors and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i actually have</font>

some shirts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll give you guys at</font>

316
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:58,449
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's a really cool emerging</font>

319
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:04,959
the bad guys down and so it's like if

320
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,369
you ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be a cop</font>

321
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,810
you can be the electronic version of

322
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,519
that right you can track<font color="#CCCCCC"> him down you</font>

323
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,500
can understand how they operate and

324
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,730
ultimately if you can disrupt what

325
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,860
they're trying to do you make it really

326
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,920
hard for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> right if you find where</font>

they're working from<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can disrupt</font>

328
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,329
that infrastructure they have to go

00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:24,339
somewhere else<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's really a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> neat</font>

330
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:26,138
area and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's fascinating</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

331
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:27,670
actually find their pictures<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't</font>

332
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:28,930
have a whole bunch of pictures of folks

them up<font color="#CCCCCC"> but one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the one of the actors</font>

335
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,709
we call anchor<font color="#CCCCCC"> panda</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we would like</font>

336
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,380
to give you know cute names and pictures

focused on oceanic<font color="#CCCCCC"> activity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so anything</font>

along those lines around the world

345
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,779
that's what they break into<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

346
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:03,490
typically like to break in by sending a

spear fish so you know those<font color="#E5E5E5"> emails that</font>

348
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,680
look legitimate

00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">get into computers we were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lucky enough</font>

352
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">they were trying to break into a bunch</font>

353
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:15,009
of computers and we were lucky enough to

354
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:17,769
see one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> systems on the internet</font>

355
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:20,380
that was basically open<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we began</font>

356
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:21,160
monitoring that system and we began

357
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,160
seeing all

358
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,750
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> every piece of malware they had</font>

359
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,060
every time they try to create a new

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,040
campaign<font color="#CCCCCC"> in spearfish another company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

361
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,449
would actually see it before<font color="#E5E5E5"> before it</font>

362
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,219
would go out before the<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies were</font>

363
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:34,990
broken into and then we would let those

364
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,699
companies know about it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font>

365
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,990
really ahead of the curve

366
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:41,079
you know that was our mission to protect

367
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,970
those those customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple other fun</font>

cell phone hacking yes

this kids smart<font color="#CCCCCC"> whose is this your son</font>

373
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,470
the question was did we just tell our

374
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,930
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we tell everybody answer is</font>

375
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,120
we actually told everybody we could and

376
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:16,010
the the honest truth was it was

377
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,300
Christmas Eve and all of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> emails</font>

378
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to light up because we're</font>

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,319
monitoring this particular adversary

381
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,730
she was wondering where I was for dinner

382
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,740
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were on the east coast with</font>

383
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:30,230
some relatives and we were actually

384
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,180
sending victim notification letters out

385
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,620
so we would tell the victims that they

386
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,939
were going to be attacked<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> given</font>

387
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,950
all the information we have we didn't

388
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,410
hold anything back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we got to as many</font>

389
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,570
people as maybe companies that we could

390
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:43,250
in that short period of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it was</font>

391
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:45,230
more of a community service and we try

392
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,010
to help everybody out<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's a good</font>

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,620
question

394
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:51,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me give you some other cool</font>

395
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:55,100
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worked on cellphones how</font>

396
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:58,700
many of you guys have cellphones<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

397
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:01,010
good amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my my son who's 12 keeps</font>

398
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:04,190
hitting me up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he still has</font>

399
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:05,840
his is a ipod touch with google voice

400
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,430
and all kinds of other things so it's

401
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,500
effectively<font color="#E5E5E5"> a phone as long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi</font>

402
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:12,199
network but one of the things that that

403
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">i did a prior security conference is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

404
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,840
decided to figure out how susceptible

405
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,610
these phones were to attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what we</font>

406
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,650
did is we went out to the black market

407
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:24,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the black market you can actually buy</font>

408
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:26,329
security vulnerabilities and we went out

409
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,890
to sort of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a black</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> market is</font>

410
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,290
maybe like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great market some people</font>

411
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:33,260
that we knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need 20</font>

412
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,250
vulnerabilities<font color="#CCCCCC"> for phone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we want to</font>

413
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,439
know how much that is

414
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:40,190
take a guess how many how much 20

415
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,420
vulnerabilities for<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> million</font>

416
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">not quite</font>

417
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,020
we were lucky<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they were just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

418
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">flaws</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they weren't weaponized</font>

419
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,230
vulnerability so there's a difference

420
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,390
between being able to actually break in

421
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,810
and actually having a flaw<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paid</font>

422
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:56,480
$1,500 for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24 abilities within</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phone</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">crashes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> within the browser</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so what we</font>

424
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,750
decided to do was to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through all 20</font>

425
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,600
of those and find one that was

426
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,910
applicable to the browser and the

427
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,500
browser code<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Android and Apple they</font>

428
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,420
share the same code<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they're</font>

429
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,130
different phones<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't have really</font>

430
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,870
enough time to work on the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> apple</font>

431
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,689
stuff so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

432
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:15,460
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> android so we actually weaponize</font>

433
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,930
the vulnerability and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll show you what</font>

434
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,300
it looks like and what the attack

435
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:21,069
actually did so we sent<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fake SMS</font>

436
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,900
message to your phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> that said hey your</font>

click on this carrier update<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that we</font>

439

can make sure that your carrier list is

00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:31,240
always updated<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we did that and we</font>

441
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:34,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a website which allows you to send</font>

445
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:44,829
they see message on the phone it looks

446
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,079
like it's from AT&T or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Verizon or</font>

447
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:49,180
whoever and they click on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> once you</font>

448
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,400
click on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> we then exploited</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

449
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">vulnerability that was in the browser</font>

450
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the vulnerability that</font>

451
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,220
we bought<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again that vulnerability</font>

452
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,989
didn't do anything until we weaponize it

453
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">we actually had to build all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

454
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:04,870
tools necessary to weaponize and exploit

455
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,819
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> android operating system so once we</font>

456
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:09,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">once we exploited that we were running</font>

457
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:11,020
as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the privilege of the browser</font>

458
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:11,800
which actually doesn't have a lot of

459
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,109
privileges

460
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so the next thing that we did is we</font>

461
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:17,649
escalated<font color="#CCCCCC"> are privileged and this is</font>

462
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:19,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">these are just common techniques that</font>

463
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,040
you can actually read about<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the book</font>

464
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:23,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we went from a very low level</font>

465
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,329
privileged user which was nobody to the

466
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:27,309
most privileged user which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was route</font>

467
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:29,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> android operating system</font>

468
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:32,470
runs<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially a modified version of</font>

469
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:34,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">linux then from there we actually took a</font>

470
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:37,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">Chinese remote access tool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually</font>

471
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,820
found this in one of our investigations

472
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,750
and we modified it and we installed it

473
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,879
on the fault

474
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,679
now once we<font color="#E5E5E5"> installed it on the phone we</font>

475
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">have no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way to control it because we</font>

476
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:49,390
only got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the malware itself we didn't</font>

477
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:54,070
actually have the server part of uh the

478
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:56,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">the the the malware if you will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we</font>

479
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,760
went out and we actually built our own

480
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:01,300
command and control server for the

481
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,740
malware<font color="#E5E5E5"> we integrated into google</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

482
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,139
that we can do some really cool things

483
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:08,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you can see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> map here you can</font>

484
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:11,470
actually track<font color="#CCCCCC"> the GPS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the location of</font>

485
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,030
where people are at<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the funny story</font>

486
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,830
is one of our researchers<font color="#CCCCCC"> what was</font>

487
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,480
working on this and he went out on a

488
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">Friday night and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when he got back home</font>

489
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,120
it was pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> late was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about eleven</font>

490
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:23,649
o'clock on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> East Coast and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight o'clock for me on the</font>

492
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:29,440
down west<font color="#E5E5E5"> coast so I knew he was home so</font>

493
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:32,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i actually chatted with him he had a</font>

494
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,700
chat software running and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said hey I'm</font>

495
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,830
glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're home and his white white</font>

496
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">freaked out because you know i was</font>

497
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,919
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracking their movements where</font>

498
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,360
they were at but those are the kind of

499
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,860
cool things that you can actually do so

500
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,600
let me let me give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a quick rundown</font>

501
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">on what you can do once you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> compromise</font>

502
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,500
the phone you can track of your

503
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,900
movements movements via GPS you can

504
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,160
actually hijack the phone calls<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

505
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,930
were actually listening to his phone

506
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,130
calls<font color="#E5E5E5"> as they were going out actually</font>

507
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,110
slightly after because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we make a</font>

508
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,880
recording<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were able to get all those</font>

509
00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:00,429
text messages<font color="#CCCCCC"> were able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get all those</font>

510
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,440
emails and we're actually able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hot</font>

511
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">mic the phone so as the phone was just</font>

512
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,450
sitting there we can actually turn the

513
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,090
mic on

514
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:08,380
it's the ultimate spy weapon<font color="#E5E5E5"> but those</font>

515
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:11,699
are some of the cool things that we were

516
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,700
actually able to do question

517
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">well</font>

518
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah it was it was a demo you know so we</font>

519
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,929
weren't all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerned we didn't</font>

520
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,209
have a lot of sensitive information on

521
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:41,470
it and it took us about you know three

522
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,790
weeks worth the effort with some really

523
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,020
smart guys so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't all that</font>

524
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:47,379
concerned that someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is gonna be able</font>

525
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:50,559
to do that on this particular case but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

526
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:52,990

already had a back door and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> hacked</font>

531
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:03,850
the back door so that the second group

looking to try to break into those

you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this really you know the next</font>

up a test system at home<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure</font>

00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:34,639
there's probably a lot of mom and<font color="#CCCCCC"> dads</font>

00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:36,799
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have their own test system that</font>
