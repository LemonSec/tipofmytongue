<font color="#CCCCCC">good should we should we talk about some</font>

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:10,559
hardware hacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok cool so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um my name</font>

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:13,740
is Joe Graham and I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an electrical</font>

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">i love</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> electronics</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I live it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I breathe</font>

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been involved in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> electronic</font>

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">since I was 17</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years old</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,990
building<font color="#E5E5E5"> projects out of magazines and</font>

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,760
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opening things up and see how</font>

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,830
they work in breaking things and taking

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,230
apart broken things and taking apart not

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,570
broken things and breaking them

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,219
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> love to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> loved being able to think of</font>

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,450
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and build it and see it</font>

16
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,309
working

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">I when I was a kid that wasn't really</font>

18
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,410
the coolest thing to do to be involved

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,899
in computers and electronics was sort of

20
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,279
like having a big spike on your head or

21
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,629
something everybody just kind of looked

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">at you and laughed and everything</font>

23
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:57,570
pointed but now i'm laughing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay i just figured as long as I was</font>

25
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,579
doing what I love to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it didn't</font>

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,530
matter what other people thought which

27
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,090
is also part of the hacker mindset so

28
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,380
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even just hardware hacking</font>

29
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">accra mindset in general</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

30
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,259
something that you love<font color="#E5E5E5"> and something</font>

31
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,399
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanna they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do and</font>

32
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,570
something you believe in something you

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,299
try it doesn't matter what anyone else

34
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:20,820
says<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're gonna talk about hardware</font>

35
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:22,049
hacking and there's a few kind of things

36
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,850
about hardware hacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind</font>

37
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,320
of break it into a few a few different

38
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,020
areas but one is about learning and

39
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,880
having fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the curiosity side of</font>

40
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,589
things like how does that thing work

41
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm just seeing how things are working</font>

42
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun with experimenting like these</font>

43
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,430
you know like the badges you guys have

44
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">been tinkering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's an</font>

45
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,799
important part<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be solving a</font>

46
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,220
difficult problem maybe there's like

47
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,140
some cool thing you're working on some

48
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,610
project or something that you're like I

49
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,170
wish I had a way to control this robot<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

50
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,700
wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had a way to do something with</font>

51
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,259
this toy<font color="#E5E5E5"> or like turn this toy into</font>

52
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,610
something cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can do that with</font>

53
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,369
hardware hacking anything that you can

54
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,560
think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can make and that's what's</font>

55
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,270
so cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like with software but with</font>

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,860
software<font color="#CCCCCC"> he can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really see it right</font>

57
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,478
you can kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorts sometimes you can</font>

58
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,520
see the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware you can</font>

59
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,610
always see in electronics you can change

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,770
one thing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

61
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,110
change everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's what's so</font>

62
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,850
cool about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something</font>

63
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,620
that's never been done before

64
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,910
if you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have</font>

65
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,440
something that you're thinking of<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

66
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe there may be something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has been</font>

67
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,980
done so that might be something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

68
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,400
let's see what's a good example of that

69
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't know maybe like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the the 3d</font>

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,930
printers<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was no</font>

71
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,380
easy way for somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> just print out</font>

72
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:40,540
their own object<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really never been</font>

73
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,430
done on a scale you know they had big 3d

74
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,140
printers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for big companies</font>

75
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,770
but there was nothing that like me and

76
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,329
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could just go and build and and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

77
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">makes something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

78
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,000
hardware hacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and creating</font>

79
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's never been done in</font>

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,590
doing something really cool with it I'm

81
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure you guys have heard this in every</font>

82
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,000
single talk at<font color="#CCCCCC"> at roots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asylum not</font>

83
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,570
breaking the law

84
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,680
that's an important one trust me you

85
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,090
don't want to break the law when you do

86
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,880
this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the laws have changed a</font>

87
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,410
lot since<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was a kid i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could get away</font>

88
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,519
with a lot more than what you guys can

89
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,320
get away with just because the

90
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,030
technology wasn't understood<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

91
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,350
internet wasn't understood electronics

92
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">and hardware like all this stuff nobody</font>

93
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">i tried to explain stuff to my parents</font>

94
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,600
and they sort of got it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the</font>

95
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,130
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government was in a</font>

96
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,989
different world so things<font color="#CCCCCC"> are just</font>

97
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,549
things are just different but nowadays

98
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:30,280
you know you have so many opportunities

99
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:31,840
that you don't have to break the law to

100
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,549
learn stuff you can come to places like

101
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,140
this you can go to DEFCON you can go to

102
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:37,989
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> hackerspace you can go to your</font>

103
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,149
school who probably has no computer lab

104
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:41,739
or some electronics things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's so</font>

105
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,320
many workplaces that you can go that you

106
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:46,299
don't have to kind of reach outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

107
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,239
the law to do things and that's a really

108
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:52,180
important thing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to go</font>

109
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,380
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> like some may be famous hardware</font>

110
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,870
hackers that you may or may not

111
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">recognize just to let you know like</font>

112
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,160
hardware hacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> we going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on for a long</font>

113
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,260
time it's not just since<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arduino</font>

114
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,880
processor maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> your or in the past few</font>

115
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,929
years it's been going on for hunt for

116
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:09,250
hundreds of years

117
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:11,799
this old guy is<font color="#CCCCCC"> as Thomas and you guys</font>

118
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:15,820
remember what he<font color="#E5E5E5"> what he developed he</font>

119
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:19,390
created the<font color="#CCCCCC"> light bulb</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's right so</font>

120
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,709
among lots of other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

121
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,990
much the most famous for creating the

122
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:25,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">light bulb and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

123
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">it in my notes there's some car</font>

124
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">diversity about how many times he tried</font>

125
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,400
to develop the filament in the right

126
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:34,219
design of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lightbulb</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it was some</font>

127
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,448
thousands of times<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ever you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know he</font>

128
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,360
tried all these different things and

129
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:40,370
just kept failing and over and over and

130
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,979
over and over and over again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he got</font>

131
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,780
it right<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set up that was</font>

132
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:46,880
just perfect that would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-cost and</font>

133
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,739
that would last a long time and that's

134
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,300
part of the hardware hacking mindset

135
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's trying things over and over again</font>

136
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:56,330
until you get it the way that you want

137
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">and he took a lot of you know</font>

138
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody's making fun of him like</font>

139
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,039
you're never gonna do it you're never

140
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to figure out how to make</font>

141
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,310
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> an electric light bulb that's good</font>

142
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,970
he didn't listen to them and that's

143
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:12,080
another important thing about these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

144
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:15,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">steve wozniak Steve Jobs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize those</font>

145
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:20,719
names<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I think what company they</font>

146
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:22,100
created<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple yeah so here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pictures of</font>

147
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,030
these guys back in the day when they

148
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,120
were young

149
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,260
maybe like your parents age or something

150
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,780
now probably younger than your parents

151
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:34,460
of the they're basically kids and on the

152
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">Left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that steve wozniak with</font>

153
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,060
something called<font color="#E5E5E5"> a blue box which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

154
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:39,650
device that<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to be able to use to</font>

155
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,620
essentially travel through the phone

156
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:46,429
system using different types of sounds

157
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,389
and that was something where it wasn't

158
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,490
you know that was kind of on the edge

159
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,300
this was this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was way back this was 50</font>

160
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:54,139
years ago

161
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">um but that was kind of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

162
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:59,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if it was totally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> illegal but it</font>

163
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,280
wasn't totally legal<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this was the</font>

164
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:04,820
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> of he was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hacking and he was</font>

165
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,070
learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that and you know his so</font>

166
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">was kind of fascination with electronics</font>

167
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,449
and with the telephone system is what

168
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:15,560
led him to develop the<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple computer</font>

169
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:17,240
which is just amazing and then showing

170
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,560
down here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that picture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

171
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,490
can see in that box is<font color="#E5E5E5"> little circuit</font>

172
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,440
board in there that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the that's the</font>

first Apple<font color="#E5E5E5"> Computer that came as a kit</font>

a keyboard<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't have a monitor you</font>

176
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,219
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of hack stuff together and</font>

177
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,349
that's where things were back in the day

178
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,030
lots of hardware hackers<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think sort</font>

179
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:33,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">of went away is the software for</font>

180
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,450
computers became more common in the

181
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kinda shied away from</font>

182
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">hard went back to software</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's</font>

183
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,030
always been my thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> of trying to like</font>

184
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">get people back into electronics</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and get</font>

185
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:46,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">it people back into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into hardware</font>

186
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:50,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a more recent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> picture of steve</font>

187
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:53,090
jobs with the with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> macbook so</font>

188
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:56,810
creating something new<font color="#E5E5E5"> with hardware</font>

189
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,219
hacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to show you just a</font>

190
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,990
few projects<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I worked on when I was</font>

191
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,670
a kid<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to kind of give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you an idea</font>

192
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,440
of what you can do maybe inspire you a

193
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,450
little bit to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to build</font>

194
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,650
something like that little<font color="#E5E5E5"> mischievous</font>

195
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:11,180
devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the top is a little hard</font>

196
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,979
to see that was the first circuit board

197
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,260
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i ever made and all it has honored</font>

198
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two resistors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not much to</font>

199
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,820
the circuit<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that would plug into the</font>

200
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,050
telephone line<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how many of</font>

201
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,290
you guys actually have telephones that

202
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,850
plug into things anymore but I still do

203
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,050
probably by the time you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> older you're</font>

204
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,610
not gonna have telephone lines at all

205
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:32,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">but this thing plugs in a telephone line</font>

206
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,650
and you can use the phone as normal from

207
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,359
your house you can call your friends and

208
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,289
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if somebody tries to call</font>

209
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,350
you

210
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:41,180
it appears<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a busy signal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's</font>

211
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,970
totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's fun to kind of mess with</font>

212
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,290
people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i used it to prevent sales</font>

213
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,720
guys from calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> her house during</font>

214
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,100
dinner and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was worried that teachers</font>

215
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,500
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to call my parents and tell</font>

216
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,510
them about you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was doing at</font>

217
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,950
school<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i plug</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing in so no one</font>

218
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">could call my parents and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I could always</font>

219
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,380
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could still use the phone like</font>

220
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,740
it was nothing

221
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's see some other</font>

222
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,950
ones the lower the lower corner that

223
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,500
little box

224
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:09,080
have you guys seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> projects that are</font>

225
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,940
built into like Altoids boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and little</font>

226
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,710
kind of candy boxes that you can do

227
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,880
these days little kits<font color="#CCCCCC"> you put inside of</font>

228
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,979
candy boxes because it's like a

229
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">good-sized this was a box from from a</font>

230
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:21,320
long time ago similar type of concept

231
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,520
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I build a circuit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty basic</font>

232
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,250
circuit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would just generate a</font>

233
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,960
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> high pitch sound</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have high</font>

234
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">pitch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sound high-frequency sounds it's</font>

235
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,780
hard to locate where it's actually

236
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:32,030
coming from because it bounces all over

237
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,130
the place so it is i<font color="#E5E5E5"> built the circuit</font>

238
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">put it inside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this box which is for</font>

239
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,880
like cough drops and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd sit in class</font>

240
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,370
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in high school I'd sit in class</font>

241
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">turn this thing on and put it on my desk</font>

242
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was just this noise would just be</font>

243
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:45,229
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's that</font>

244
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,550
sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> but no one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could figure out where</font>

245
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,730
it's coming from the teachers can figure

246
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:54,599
it out or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was totally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

247
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:56,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the final one is</font>

248
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,190
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> built</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> towards the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

249
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:01,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">of high school and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard about this</font>

250
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,720
kind of as<font color="#CCCCCC"> rumours where you could have</font>

00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:08,160
a laser<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> China laser off of a window</font>

252
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:10,320
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the return of the laser based on</font>

253

vibrations of the of the window<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">return laser would be modulated with the</font>

255
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,500
audio that's inside of the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so</font>

256
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,660
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can sort of spy on people from</font>

257
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,070
outside of their house or<font color="#CCCCCC"> spy on your</font>

258
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,019
teachers if they're having a conference

259
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,160
in a different room with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> window so I</font>

260
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,620
want to build this thing and see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

261
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,850
was actually possible and the rumor was

262
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,110
like the government has been doing it

263
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,230
for years they've been spying on

264
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:34,800
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they probably are and were</font>

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:37,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh huh but this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I used a big five</font>

milliwatts<font color="#E5E5E5"> red lasers you can see it if</font>

267
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a government</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a laser you</font>

268
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,219
couldn't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> but i use a red one and it</font>

269
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,260
worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok i could play</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> music in my room</font>

270
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">and turn the stereo up all the way and</font>

271
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,350
it would move the window a little bit

272
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,430
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like barely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it sort</font>

273
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">of proved the concept and that was</font>

274
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,849
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do because</font>

275
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:58,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">I didn't know if it was possible</font>

276
00:09:53,850 --> 00:10:01,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">so that's creating something new a</font>

277
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:03,420
little more recent<font color="#E5E5E5"> few years ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

278
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,740
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a TV show called prototype this which</font>

279
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,599
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on discovery channel and it's on</font>

280
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,339
netflix now which is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font>

281
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,990
people building prototypes of crazy

282
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:12,690
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you want to see like</font>

283
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:15,329
gigantic ridiculous things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10-foot</font>

284
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,920
giant boxing robots that that punch

285
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:19,138
based on the movements of players

286
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,790
outside the ring<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's prototype this</font>

287
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:23,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's creating something new that was</font>

288
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,019
just completely out of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> head idea</font>

289
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:26,579
that were like what looks good on TV

290
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,050
that we could kind of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be fun</font>

291
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:31,319
and we can like build something gigantic

292
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:34,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that had we had a pneumatic control</font>

293
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:35,729
and accelerometers<font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless</font>

294
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,260
accelerometers in the boxing<font color="#E5E5E5"> gloves so</font>

295
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,480
as you threw a punch the robot would do

296
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,079
the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was totally cool you</font>

297
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys too heavy</font>

298
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:45,449
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see that movie real steel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

299
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,000
the rumor is that real steel was based

300
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:50,339
on this episode of the show<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't</font>

301
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">confirm that but yeah so that's um</font>

302
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,769
that's creating something<font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

303
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,430
totally ridiculous

304
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:58,170
here's another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's me wearing</font>

305
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,790
full firefighter gear<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was another</font>

306
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,339
one from the show which was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-tech</font>

307
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">firefighter pack and firefighters most</font>

308
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,740
the time they have gear<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kinda out</font>

309
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:07,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">dated</font>

311
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:11,520
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be really cool that they</font>

312
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,800
could go into a fire<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put out fires</font>

313
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,930
with like a superhero sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

314
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,510
don't spray<font color="#CCCCCC"> fire extinguisher out like</font>

315
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">spider-man</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heads-up display</font>

316
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,569
that they could where they could see

317
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,939
through all the smoke and figure out

318
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,350
where other people are in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

319
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,480
you imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fire and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's smoke</font>

320
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,279
everywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know total chaos they</font>

321
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,570
can walk in and know exactly where

322
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,620
people are so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can pull them out and</font>

323
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:36,149
rescue them

324
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,800
what else do we have on there<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had an</font>

325
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:39,120
identification<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are not only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">they would know where the other</font>

328
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,140
firefighters are<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an important</font>

329
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,060
thing is you always want to keep your

330
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,279
keep your people together<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

331
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of fun one that actually had you</font>

know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as opposed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the boxing which</font>

333
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,110
was just for fun this had a real purpose

334
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we tested this with real</font>

335
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">firefighters and they got to actually</font>

336
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:59,070
use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you know you can actually</font>

337
00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:01,649
create things that help people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have</font>

a<font color="#CCCCCC"> up further golden</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just for fun</font>

339
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:08,730
modifying electronics<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking something</font>

340
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,279
that already exists<font color="#CCCCCC"> and making it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

341
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,029
something else or tweaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> functionality</font>

342
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,380
a little bit

343
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:18,390
this is my favorite example and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

344
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">garage door opener for my parent's</font>

345
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:24,149
garage door<font color="#CCCCCC"> I built this when I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 16 or something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the way</font>

347
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:27,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> garage door opener works is that you</font>

348
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:30,000
have a transmitter which is what this is

349
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set a set a certain code on the</font>

350
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,779
transmitter and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> set</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a receiver on</font>

351
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,880
the garage door to match that code<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

352
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">I push the button it sends a code</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if the</font>

353
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,029
receiver matches that code<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

354
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,800
open the garage door<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

355
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:42,089
right code<font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't just like a</font>

356
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,550
password if it's not the right password

357
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:48,329
is not going to open the door<font color="#E5E5E5"> but on the</font>

358
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:50,219
garage door transmitter<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a set of</font>

359
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:51,329
switches<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 switches that you would set</font>

360
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's how you would set your</font>

361
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:56,339
password and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> switches</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be on</font>

362
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">and off so there's really only a finite</font>

363
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:02,850
number of settings<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you can have on</font>

364
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,479
off on every single switch that ends up

365
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:08,790
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1024 possible combinations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

366
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">could if you wanted to just individually</font>

367
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:13,020
try every combination by hand until<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

368
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:14,790
got the password that was right<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

369
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">decided to build some electronics to do</font>

370
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,270
that for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I have a little circuit</font>

371
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,859
in there that will cycle through<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

372
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:22,230
possible combination of those passwords

373
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:25,140
and open any garage door that uses the

374
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:27,150
system so that was fun

375
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:30,449
I didn't go into any of the garages<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

376
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:32,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">I opened again not breaking the law</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

377
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was a fun thing to show look this is</font>

378
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,030
really bad security and at the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

379
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">would you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this was right before the</font>

380
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,630
security industry became this thing but

381
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,950
this was my first time of building

382
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,210
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could actually show to</font>

383
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,370
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say look we need to change</font>

384
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,960
the way this is done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my parents and</font>

385
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> showed it on my parents store</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

386
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,800
great you know they patted me on the

387
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,210
back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ok ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so they didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> date</font>

388
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,530
they got a little bit and that sort of

389
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">the response that we see from a lot of</font>

390
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,470
vendors these days like people that sell

391
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,530
hardware products if we find problems

392
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,510
like a good job go away and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't you</font>

393
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,650
know doing things to make them<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize</font>

394
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it was important and eventually</font>

395
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:06,780
moved all their stuff out of the garage

396
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:08,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the important stuff that's a fun one</font>

397
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:11,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">here's one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just started working</font>

398
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,880
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's incomplete which is why the</font>

399
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:16,950
picture is incomplete<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's a anybody</font>

400
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,920
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tooth tunes toothbrush</font>

401
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:23,310
yeah somebody does awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's a</font>

402
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,839
toothbrush that will play music for<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

403
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,250
minutes and when you when you put the

404
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,140
toothbrush toothbrush on your teeth

405
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,570
through bone conduction it feels like

406
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,400
you're actually hearing the music<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

407
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,570
really it's a really cool concept so

408
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">plays music for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two minutes because</font>

409
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's how long you're supposed to brush</font>

410
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:41,069
your teeth<font color="#CCCCCC"> so i bought one of those and</font>

411
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:44,550
it plays dynomite<font color="#CCCCCC"> the song dynamite and</font>

412
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:46,800
which is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay song</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright not really</font>

413
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,439
my style<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was like okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm gonna</font>

414
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">modify it and play my own song that I</font>

415
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">like so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can brush my teeth to music</font>

416
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:57,449
that I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what I did is I took all</font>

417
00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:00,210
the circuitry out of the bottom of the

418
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:02,040
of the toothbrush and basically threw

419
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:05,160
that away<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had to create my own</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> circuit</font>

420
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:08,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">that play songs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but first i want to see</font>

421
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:11,699
how it works<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took it all apart the the</font>

422
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:13,530
kind of speaker part that vibrates the

423
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,930
toothbrush head which is how you hear

424
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,850
the music<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to wire</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i could</font>

425
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">treat that as a regular speaker and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

426
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:23,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">I had to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is build some circuitry to</font>

427
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,920
play<font color="#CCCCCC"> sounds are songs off of an SD card</font>

428
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,850
and that's something that in the past

429
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,079
few years ago that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have been</font>

430
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,590
really difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just did a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

431
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">search for SD card</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wav file playing wav</font>

432
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,810
files

433
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's tons of circuits I built up a</font>

434
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,979
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find the best one that I</font>

435
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:40,019
could do in the smallest form factor<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

436
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,220
I loaded a song<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> file now I</font>

437
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">can play my own song</font>

438
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,610
the next step<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to cram all of that</font>

439
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:47,790
circuitry back into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> toothbrush and</font>

440
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,680
then use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so modifying electronics and</font>

441
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,240
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely no reason why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I need</font>

442
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,109
to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know how to brush my</font>

443
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:57,149
teeth<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just</font>

444
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:03,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">something cool</font>

445
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:05,880
testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> security center here at Def Con</font>

446
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:07,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a lot of security related stuff</font>

447
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:11,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's all sorts of products out there</font>

448
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,439
that claim to be secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> antivirus and</font>

449
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:15,870
hardware things and everything but

450
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,060
really it takes a hacker it takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

451
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware hacker to do to test security</font>

452
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,739
and tell people if it's good or not

453
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you can't really trust the</font>

454
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:28,380
people selling stuff because they want

455
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:30,149
to sell you stuff so it's up to us to go

456
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,490
to them and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> now it's not exactly</font>

457
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:33,990
secure or maybe it is secure maybe they

458
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">do deserve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a pat on the back but in</font>

459
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:38,100
general it's always good to test things

460
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,630
on your own and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's I'm naturally</font>

461
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that i don't normally trust what</font>

462
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,889
people say<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to do things on my own</font>

463
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's part of the hacker mindset</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

464
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:47,880
as far as like you know somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiter</font>

465
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:49,050
brings a plate<font color="#CCCCCC"> 22 the table at a</font>

466
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,000
restaurant<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like don't touch the</font>

467
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,229
plate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really hot and I always such</font>

468
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plate to see if they're telling the</font>

469
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,439
truth

470
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:56,849
so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one you can't really see the</font>

471
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:58,439
screen so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one's actually not really</font>

472
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna be that exciting</font>

473
00:16:58,439 --> 00:17:02,310
this was an example of testing the

474
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:04,619
security of the parking meters in<font color="#CCCCCC"> san</font>

475
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:06,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">francisco</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is some work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i did a few</font>

476
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:08,369
years ago when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moved to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> san</font>

477
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">francisco and i noticed they use smart</font>

478
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:12,389
cards that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you buy that</font>

479
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,500
have a certain number of dollars on<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

480
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,600
when you put them into the parking meter

481
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the meter will add money to the</font>

482
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,208
meter and take money off<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the card</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

483
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">was like that's cool</font>

484
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:20,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've never worked with smart cards</font>

485
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,168
before so for me it was a great

486
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:24,030
opportunity to learn something new

487
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:25,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">sighs like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I want to see how the</font>

488
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">system works</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through this whole</font>

489
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,970
process to figure out how it works and

490
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,440
then created my own custom<font color="#CCCCCC"> smartcard to</font>

491
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,990
see if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> defeat the security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

492
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,840
wrote some code<font color="#E5E5E5"> loaded onto my own card</font>

493
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,760
and it's completely impossible to see on

494
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,889
the screen<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to trust me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font>

495
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,700
play the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video anyway maybe you'll be</font>

496
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:45,500
able to see it

497
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">so normally put the card</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font>

498
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">show you a value would say like twenty</font>

499
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:53,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">dollars remaining or something in this</font>

500
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:55,940
case can you barely see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> 999 dollars</font>

501
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:57,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">and ninety-nine cents</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a lot of</font>

502
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,260
parking

503
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:04,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four hours worth of San</font>

504
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:05,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">Francisco but that you know the maximum</font>

505
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,120
value parking<font color="#E5E5E5"> card you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can buy as fifty</font>

506
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,649
dollars there's no reason it<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't</font>

507
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">the system should allow somebody to put</font>

in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the card that says it has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nine</font>

tell the city about it and say hey you

guys have a problem if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know about the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there's probably people out there</font>

516

ripping you off and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're getting</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">management demolition derby</font>

647
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:29,140
there's a lot of soldering<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

648
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:31,480
soldering<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't all fun and games</font>

649
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:34,240
it's pretty dangerous<font color="#E5E5E5"> these fumes are</font>

650
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,510
toxic<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't want to bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them in</font>

652
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,740
so even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though soldering isn't that sexy</font>

653
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,590
and it's a little bit dangerous<font color="#E5E5E5"> without</font>

00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ordering here's the</font>

660
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:03,850
multimeter<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really cool piece of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">multimeter the multimeter yeah x3 here</font>

666
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:16,630
comes to electronics<font color="#CCCCCC"> this sleepy little</font>

667
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:18,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">baby right here can measure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just about</font>

668
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:20,410
anything but until<font color="#E5E5E5"> these buttons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

669
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:22,750
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> can measure all sorts of aspects</font>

670
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:27,730
of an electronic system like<font color="#E5E5E5"> voltage</font>

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:28,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">current resistance capacitance and so</font>

672
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:30,130
much more

673
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,620
so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> testify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good</font>

676
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,179
it's the multimeter is definitely one of

677
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,080
the best diagnostic tools we have up

678
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,640
here in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lair</font>

679
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,949
it's so versatile you can even measure

680
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:53,409
temperature and tell you if you're sick

681
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:58,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">dr. our temperature probe wasn't working</font>

683
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:04,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright then the oscilloscope this is by</font>

684
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:08,320
far my favorite tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here I'll show</font>

685
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:13,210
you about it

686
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:15,580
one of my favorite tools up here in the

687
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:17,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">layer is a digital oscilloscope that's</font>

00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,389
the digital oscilloscope<font color="#CCCCCC"> this thing is</font>

689
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:21,520
like the Swiss Army knife of<font color="#E5E5E5"> electronic</font>

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,789
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> an electrical signal and how it</font>

692
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:27,130
changes over time

00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:28,150
check it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remote control have you</font>

694
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,520
ever wondered how these things

695
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:32,350
communicate with your TV with the

696
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,520
oscilloscope<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can see the signal is</font>

697
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">being transmitted from the remote</font>

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,580
control to the television

699
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,280
here's what it looks like when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font>

700
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:41,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn off the TV this is what it looks</font>

701
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,809
like when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i change channels</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

702
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:46,960
really high-end oscilloscope<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:48,908
adjust<font color="#E5E5E5"> the size of the waveform and the</font>

one of my shirt

707
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:59,500
it sounds like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm wearing a sound</font>

708
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:01,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">i use this baby right here for every</font>

719
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:27,979
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> loved the oscilloscope but I could</font>

720
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:29,449
just a good tool to have because other

721
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:30,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">without the oscilloscope you can't you</font>

722
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a circuit right and you can</font>

723
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:34,279
see it blinking a<font color="#CCCCCC"> light or doing</font>

724
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:35,899
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you can't really know</font>

725
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:39,440
what's going on each of those signals

726
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:42,529
some other really cool stuff you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

727
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">depending on if you have access to x-ray</font>

728
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:46,940
machines with your dentist has x-ray

729
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,739
machines<font color="#E5E5E5"> or your veterinarian has x-ray</font>

730
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,659
machines maybe your parents have access

731
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:52,969
to one<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can actually look inside of</font>

732
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:54,469
electronics and see what's going on

733
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:55,820
inside the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> chips you have these</font>

734
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:59,899
are connected and that's really awesome

735
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:03,379
and you have advanced stuff like

736
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:06,978
decapping chips<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you look on your</font>

737
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:09,859
badge<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those little black chips have</font>

738
00:27:06,979 --> 00:27:12,320
little tiny silicon dies inside it's

739
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:14,119
almost like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> almost like a city</font>

740
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,769
inside it's almost like a circuit board

741
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:17,928
inside of each of those little chips

742
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:18,979
microscopic if you look with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

743
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:21,169
microscope you can see different

744
00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:23,239
portions of it and if you zoom down

745
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:26,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">close enough you can see individual</font>

746
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:28,279
transistors that form the entire chip<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

747
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:30,289
what you can do is take a chip if you're

748
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,669
doing security research or you want to

749
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:33,889
try to get information about apart you

750
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:36,139
can use chemicals or you can use special

751
00:27:33,889 --> 00:27:38,209
machines that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will remove the plastic</font>

752
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:40,008
the black part of the chip and actually

753
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,719
get to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dye inside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can zoom</font>

754
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:43,460
it out and see what it looks like

755
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:45,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">so really cool advanced stuff and</font>

756
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,330
there's been some talks at<font color="#CCCCCC"> DEFCON</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

757
00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:50,299
how to work with those types of

758
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:56,449
chemicals<font color="#E5E5E5"> very dangerous stuff but also</font>

759
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:58,820
very cool so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess sort of the final</font>

760
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:00,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of summary of hardware hacking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

761
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:04,700
do it why is it cool what to do

762
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:10,700
basically you know open things up<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

763
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:12,589
how things work<font color="#E5E5E5"> experiment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and don't be</font>

764
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,749
afraid to make mistakes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that's</font>

765
00:28:12,589 --> 00:28:17,089
the one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're in school you</font>

766
00:28:14,749 --> 00:28:19,940
take a test<font color="#E5E5E5"> it usually ends up being</font>

767
00:28:17,089 --> 00:28:22,789
it's right or wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

768
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,679
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know your teachers are</font>

769
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:26,419
trying to figure out how much you know

770
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:28,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">or how much you understand what you're</font>

771
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:31,249
working with but really making mistakes

772
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:33,200
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok especially if you're experimenting</font>

773
00:28:31,249 --> 00:28:36,919
if you're wondering how things work and

774
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,179
you know you wanna just try something

775
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:39,799
and see if it's gonna work or not just

776
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:41,450
do it don't be afraid of failing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

777
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:43,279
one of the things when you fail you end

778
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:44,749
up learning more<font color="#CCCCCC"> rides</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like if you take</font>

779
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,369
a test you get a problem wrong you go

780
00:28:44,749 --> 00:28:47,690
back and try to figure out why you got

781
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:49,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">it wrong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you don't get it wrong next</font>

782
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:50,779
time with electronics<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hardware</font>

783
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,850
hacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to try something</font>

784
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:54,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their stuff it</font>

785
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:56,570
will take me weeks to try to get a

786
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:58,999
circuit right<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thomas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Edison right to</font>

787
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:00,200
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know how many</font>

788
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:02,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">years it took them to get something</font>

789
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,919
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so failing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok you just let you</font>

790
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,289
get one year just one step closer to

791
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,820
getting it right eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> and don't</font>

792
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:09,799
let anybody tell you like all your

793
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're stupid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're dumb if it doesn't</font>

794
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:13,100
work like that doesn't matter right

795
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:17,539
if you like it and you love it and you

796
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:18,709
want to do it you can do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess the</font>

797
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:21,049
final<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you're never too young to</font>

801
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:29,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">old or a year and a half or something</font>

802
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,710
like that

803
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:33,259
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> four-and-a-half now and I have a</font>

too young to start you know you've

807
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:41,720
already started with your badges<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

808
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:44,090
can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look around and see what else</font>

809
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,070
has electronics in it see what else you

810
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:47,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">can try to to to build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of things</font>

811
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:49,189
that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you've always wanted</font>

812
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:51,710
your own robot or your own toy that

813
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:55,070
doesn't exist<font color="#CCCCCC"> or maybe it exists in you</font>

00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:58,158
haven't bought it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no</font>

816
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:59,869
special occasion coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something</font>

817
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,610
it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay just building yourself</font>

818
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:02,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put it together yourself and see</font>

819
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,490
if you can do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's the most</font>

820
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:06,769
satisfying anyway being able to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

821
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:08,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself and show everybody that you did</font>

822
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:11,480
it instead of just going in<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

823
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:11,840
buying it from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> store so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that's</font>

824
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,070
it

825
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,570

<font color="#CCCCCC">Who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extra 15 minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

829
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,240
questions anybody any questions about

830

anything

831
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:37,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah so the question was I learned all</font>

832
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:39,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this stuff in school or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do I teach</font>

833
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:41,220
myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the answer is both</font>

834
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:44,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">I started learning about things on my</font>

835
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,330
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> I through magazines and just through</font>

836
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,158
reading because there was no internet

837
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:48,899
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their computers that you</font>

838
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:50,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">could connect the bulletin board systems</font>

839
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:53,428
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to people but it wasn't the</font>

840
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:56,700
internet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could just google</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff so</font>

841
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:59,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">i started mostly on my own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and when I</font>

842
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,470
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into once I got to college</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

843
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">when i actually started learning about</font>

844
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:04,620
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just did there were no</font>

845
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,110
electronics classes or anything at my

846
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">school</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when I was younger so I just kept</font>

847
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on my own went to school</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> studied</font>

848
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">Electrical Engineering so now I had the</font>

849
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:16,260
formal experience and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real</font>

850
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">world experience which i think is kind</font>

851
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:20,279
of the best of both worlds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

852
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:21,629
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> off and worked at action</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a real</font>

853
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:23,220
product development company to learn

854
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:25,110
even more about the process and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

855
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,549
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my own doing it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's</font>

856
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:29,189
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do things on your own</font>

857
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:31,500
and to learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> in school if it's something</font>

858
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:36,059
that you really like

859
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so the question was what parts that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

860
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:39,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the perpetual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> water slide</font>

861
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:43,200
which was<font color="#CCCCCC"> one episode of the TV show</font>

862
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:45,149
that was this giant<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30-foot waterslide</font>

863
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">simulator so you could sit in the bottom</font>

864
00:31:45,149 --> 00:31:50,100
of this gigantic<font color="#CCCCCC"> donut</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of water slide</font>

865
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:51,539
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> had water in it and it was</font>

866
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer-controlled</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that would basically</font>

867
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:58,350
let you ride<font color="#E5E5E5"> and unlimited water slide</font>

868
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:02,669
which was totally awesome that project

869
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:05,340
took five weeks to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> and most of that</font>

870
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:07,110
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like 20 people from</font>

871
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">San Francisco</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> artists and welders and</font>

872
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:11,340
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> building this giant structure but</font>

873
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">the control side really was there is</font>

874
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,178
some hydraulic motors and stuff to make

875
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:19,049
the thing move up and down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and left and</font>

876
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:24,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">right and go side to side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we</font>

877
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:26,610
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah basically a computer running</font>

878
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:28,289
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> code like a Macintosh running to go</font>

879
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:30,178
that was controlling all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hydraulic</font>

880
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:31,950
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so really all of the magic was</font>

881
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:34,649
done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in sauces code</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where he wrote a</font>

882
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,590
bunch of stuff to simulate that the

883
00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:39,020
different movements of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> waterslide</font>

884
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:41,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that one was very software intensive</font>

885
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:44,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">but that was my favorite project an</font>

886
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:46,700
amazing thing to ride<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's all gone</font>

887
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:48,799
now that the production company took it

888
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,299
apart once we were done<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is too bad</font>

889
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good thing to show it like</font>

890
00:32:50,299 --> 00:33:00,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">maker faire</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or something</font>

891
00:32:53,570 --> 00:33:01,939
any other questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes no no okay</font>

892
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of</font>

893
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,480
time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could always run back to the</font>

894
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:09,620
workshop area or I guess hang out here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

895
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:16,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know what the next talk is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

896
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:16,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure either so hit thanks again</font>
