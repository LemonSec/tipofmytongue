<font color="#CCCCCC">was really cheesy but the introduction</font>

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,550
had this very kind of funny thing where

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,210
they talked about that you no longer

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,099
control your TV<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now they control</font>

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,020
the picture and the vertical and the

13
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,730
horizontal and all the different parts

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,170
and you know you could no longer change

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,640
the channel<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of course you can change</font>

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,129
the channel<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it was kind of a joke</font>

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have but we thought well maybe we</font>

18
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,530
could do that now with you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

19
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:54,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">some attacks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does anybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here know</font>

20
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:55,890
what movie this is from<font color="#CCCCCC"> no well it's</font>

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe before your time</font>

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly so what he's doing here is he's</font>

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,049
actually putting on the outer limits and

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,610
you can see it there in the the the

25
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:10,110
corner there and he's you know he wants

26
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:12,150
to watch that show<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> movie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enemy</font>

27
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,909
of the state will Smith is actually

28
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,799
watching himself on his own TV<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're</font>

29
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:23,610
thinking you know it would be great if

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:27,090
we can make that happen so we performed

31
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,250
our research in<font color="#CCCCCC"> December</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last year and</font>

32
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,430
we reported the issues that we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

33
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">samsung</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in early of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> january of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this year</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we worked them to</font>

35
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,659
work on some fixes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,199
some things and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know issued</font>

37
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">passes it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issued some patches and you</font>

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,409
know they said okay you guys can talk

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,920
about it now we've got you know people

40
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,450
fixed and and you know after<font color="#CCCCCC"> June you</font>

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,399
can talk about it so we spoke<font color="#E5E5E5"> a black</font>

42
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">hat and now we're speaking here to you</font>

43
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,729
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know we know a lot about</font>

44
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,399
smartphones and everybody has one<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

45
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,829
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see you know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ios7</font>

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">development a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> line on the bottom there</font>

47
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,419
and you know everybody has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> smartphone</font>

48
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sure everybody here has a smartphone</font>

49
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,709
and you know there's lots of other smart

50
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,100
devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got smart one</font>

51
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:21,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">witches</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smart cars smart fridges that</font>

52
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:24,000
have Wi-Fi smart windows even smart

53
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,530
houses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know this is a movie that</font>

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,540
came out in the early two thousands

55
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:32,130
before we even actually had<font color="#CCCCCC"> smart houses</font>

56
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:34,410
and we even have smart toilets and this

57
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,380
is not a joke<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Japan you can buy a</font>

58
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,900
very very expensive toilet<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually</font>

59
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:43,320
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> bluetooth and you can you know use</font>

60
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,540
your smartphone to a raise and lower the

61
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,660
seat<font color="#E5E5E5"> because maybe you know you're</font>

62
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scared of germs but you know</font>

63
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:55,170
where to find about about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> smart TV</font>

64
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:57,330
and so let's look at how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we</font>

65
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,519
started thinking well you know there's

66
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,650
lots of apps and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's apps on my</font>

67
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,660
phone and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know how those work and you</font>

68
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,460
know we we deal with security of mobile

69
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,470
applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I second you know a</font>

70
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot about how to secure those but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

71
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,460
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how the apps work for</font>

72
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:14,399
a TV<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and so let's look at that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

73
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,760
so you know just like a smartphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> a TV</font>

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,530
has a front facing camera and just like

75
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,739
a smartphone<font color="#CCCCCC"> the TV</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has lots of</font>

76
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:26,340
applications and it also has a web

77
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:29,730
browser and it also has<font color="#E5E5E5"> social media</font>

78
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:33,060
applications and there's a backup

79
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,829
service and so you know we were

80
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,020
wondering you know how does how these

81
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,520
applications work and you know what is

82
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,070
what does all this mean

83
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:44,220
and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's get our heads in</font>

84
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,230
the game<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at the TV we</font>

85
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,710
cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know look at it kind of like</font>

86
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:53,790
a computer so it has a 1 gigahertz<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm</font>

87
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:55,440
just like a phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hdmi it has USB</font>

88
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:59,040
and all kinds of things just like a

89
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,450
modern smartphone or laptop and you know

90
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,380
if we start looking at the software side

91
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,540
of things

92
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,250
it's a linux-based operating system it

93
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,670
has an app store<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like the google</font>

94
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,140
play store or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iOS App Store has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

95
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,799
web browser<font color="#CCCCCC"> and facebook like we talked</font>

96
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,829
about

97
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,990
but what all those things really mean is

98
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,810
that those are what we call<font color="#CCCCCC"> attack</font>

99
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,609
surfaces<font color="#E5E5E5"> so every time you're you know</font>

100
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,410
if you think about it like a castle

101
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:24,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a castle has a drawbridge that</font>

102
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,930
lowers and raises<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that makes it so</font>

103
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,388
that is really hard for people to get in

104
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mourinho doors that you have in your</font>

105
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:33,979
castle<font color="#CCCCCC"> the more drivers you have to</font>

106
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:37,250
allow people in the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a boner</font>

107
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:38,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible point of vulnerability so when</font>

108
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,850
we have the same kind of thing for a TV

109
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">we think ok well you know there's the</font>

110
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:46,009
USB<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe we can figure out some bugs</font>

111
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">there there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stack and maybe</font>

112
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:49,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks over the</font>

113
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,090
network and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but really we</font>

114
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">focused on the applications and if you</font>

115
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,270
think about it from an<font color="#CCCCCC"> application's</font>

116
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,270
perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> after you know you have some</font>

117
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,380
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> are running on the TV there's all</font>

118
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,419
different kinds of things that you can

119
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,190
attack then you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kernel which</font>

120
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:06,530
powers the operating system behind the

121
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:09,650
TV<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go and try to you know find</font>

122
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,419
bugs in that or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cannot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mess with</font>

123
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">the the files that are on the TV to make</font>

124
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:16,130
it do things that it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> intended to</font>

125
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:18,710
do so we started with documentation

126
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we didn't actually have a TV and</font>

127
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're curious how this stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fits</font>

128
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:26,030
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found things like you</font>

129
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:29,659
know how to do some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> count reads</font>

130
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:31,609
or are they<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention things that</font>

131
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,169
developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinda are curious about you</font>

132
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,810
know there's this notion of secure

133
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:38,539
storage and that that's kind of strange

138
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,250
what a smart TV application actually is

139
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,400
and how it works

140
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,500
so the smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV applications</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on for any</font>

everything pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it handles all the</font>

so you actually don't have to go out and

buy fancy<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart TV from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Samsung in order</font>

169
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,969
actually play around with that encoding

it on your regular<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> operating</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">platform start playing around with let's</font>

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,030
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> some these files</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so when you're</font>

taking a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> application trying to</font>

figure out like what the guts are<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what it actually does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was allowed to</font>

do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the configuration is a really good</font>

183
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">it all seemed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the really basic</font>

184
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,490
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey this is obviously the</font>

185
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,280
configuration for<font color="#E5E5E5"> offer skype because it</font>

says<font color="#E5E5E5"> a the other the CP name is skype on</font>

187
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,380
but sometimes you get to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> model</font>

188
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,920
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> something's a little bit on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

189
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">morad on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so for example there's some</font>

190
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,810
things out within the configuration

191
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:41,550
files that we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the author and</font>

192
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,780
the author in this case was on something

193
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,390
that just kind of stood out to us

194
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,989
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what we noticed was that the</font>

195
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:52,349
application that was a partner with<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:54,420
the left the party platform provided the

actual like libraries<font color="#CCCCCC"> and binaries and</font>

198
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:59,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">and now the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the core guts of the</font>

199
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:01,140
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> to on to the developer and</font>

200
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,570
then it was actually the TV<font color="#E5E5E5"> developer</font>

201
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,849
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are made the application without me</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">if that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that is true for</font>

00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,280
other apps

204
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,989
maybe there's certain things within the

205
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,299
code that will carry over between all

206
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,560
these different popular applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

207
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,120
that's something that you can just get

208
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,250
right out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the configuration and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

209
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,510
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of build up an attack plan on when</font>

210
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:22,290
you're trying to do some research

211
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:24,120
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other index file on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really just</font>

212
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,460
looks like a really basic website<font color="#CCCCCC"> eaten</font>

213
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">and what it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does is it actually tells</font>

214
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:33,390
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> smart TV what other coatings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

215
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,070
load in this case most<font color="#CCCCCC"> javascript</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

216
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,929
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i'm in order to run this</font>

217
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,850
application you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to load this</font>

218
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:40,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">javascript file and open it up and then</font>

219
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,600
this javascript file and open it up

220
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,039
so once<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to learn how to</font>

221
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,780
read these from all these applications

222
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,430
that we found on the TV<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

223
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so an application like</font>

224
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">skype</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs use the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> camera that's built</font>

225
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the TV</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so what if we read through</font>

226
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,400
how it

227
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,530
is that code and figure out if we can

228
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,630
plug it into another application or

229
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,130
maybe even later on the web browser and

230
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,900
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and see if we can actually</font>

231
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,700
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> load</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the camera from those</font>

232
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:09,480
applications that<font color="#CCCCCC"> weren't supposed to be</font>

233
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:11,100
able to access the camera and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

234
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,900
is just a quick sample of us in the

235
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we might come across the smrt</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this one's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arm straight out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of skype and</font>

238
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,940
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pulls it off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something called</font>

239
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,460
my storage info and you'd expect that to

240
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,230
return something like yours your<font color="#E5E5E5"> skype</font>

262
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,640
is the application has to use these

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,959
essentially what that means is it's a

266
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,240
door from the HTML into the operating

267
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:28,050
system to do something like write a file

268
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,330
or connect to a network address or<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

269
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:33,030
you know do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I to an IP things</font>

270
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,590
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you know these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> api's</font>

271
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:37,110
provide different things and there's a

272
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:39,150
whole number of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's all</font>

273
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,910
kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> AP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that do all kinds of</font>

274
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,470
different things that you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are as</font>

275
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,810
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know security experts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wanna</font>

276
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,370
investigate more and how they work and

277
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,680
what they do and there's tons of these

278
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">AP is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's you know there's different</font>

279
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,729
kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> AP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there an API is for</font>

280
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,990
dealing with the TV

281
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,900
we're dealing with the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

282
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:00,060
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we thought okay well let's</font>

283
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,340
you know let's take an application and

284
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll put some malicious file in it and</font>

285
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,690
see if we can get that to be run<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we</font>

286
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,350
install it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we put the TV in the</font>

287
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">developer</font>

288
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">code which is just logging in as the in</font>

289
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:14,580
the name develop and we see this message

290
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,820
failed to install<font color="#CCCCCC"> please visit this</font>

security<font color="#E5E5E5"> page</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 like me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it turns out</font>

292
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it was is there's a little thing</font>

293
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:26,550
that checks to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there a executable</font>

294
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:30,240
binary called an elf on<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> LF and it</font>

295
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:31,560
says is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an elf in this file and the code</font>

296
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,170
that's looking at the application when

297
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,510
you install it says yes and so it blocks

298
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:39,089
that install so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're thinking hmm how</font>

299
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,530
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> i bypass that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so because it's</font>

300
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,420
looking at that and because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's looking</font>

301
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,939
at some of the other code that we wrote

302
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's actually analyzing that and and</font>

303
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,390
kind of trying to filter out some things

304
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:51,329
kind of like event<font color="#CCCCCC"> into virus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a way</font>

305
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:52,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so we did is we just kind of did</font>

306
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,990
something called obvious creation and we

307
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:57,090
just made<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> code that</font>

308
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,490
normally looks you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> readable and</font>

309
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:03,600
easy and we just turned into<font color="#CCCCCC"> garbling</font>

310
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:06,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">book so but still we were caught</font>

311
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,460
red-handed<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't you know get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

312
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,960
malicious code installed and you know

313
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maid is kind of sad</font>

314
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:15,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">so then we noticed that there's a zip</font>

315
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:17,910
function and that can package things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

316
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:21,089
we thought okay let's put our<font color="#CCCCCC"> health</font>

317
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:23,520
binary<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside of our zip and then will</font>

318
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:26,040
unzip<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and maybe that'll hide it from</font>

319
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:29,640
the scanner and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it turns out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it did</font>

320
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,319
hide it from the scanner<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

321
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at the smart hub which is the</font>

322
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,860
main part of the the TV when you have it

323
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:37,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">booted there's all the applications and</font>

324
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,810
things we looked in and saw you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

325
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,300
user code and normal code and then we

326
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:44,489
saw manager<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought that was interesting</font>

327
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:47,670
weird there's all these very important

328
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:50,280
sounding files<font color="#CCCCCC"> and smart home in EMP and</font>

329
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:53,040
common and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we're curious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

330
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:56,069
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it turns out is that all those</font>

331
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,319
files are actually controlling the<font color="#CCCCCC"> smart</font>

332
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:00,450
TV itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> so not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only are the</font>

333
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,840
applications written in<font color="#CCCCCC"> javascript</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

334
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:06,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">HTML but the OS that you normally using</font>

335
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,900
to launch those<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also written in</font>

336
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">javascript and HTML so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

337
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,380
picture of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> smart TV and you can see</font>

338
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,209
there you know it has lots of

339
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,280
applications in a web browser and things

340
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:20,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it turns out that again that whole</font>

341
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,089
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that is actually kinda like a</font>

342
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">website</font>

343
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:25,529
and so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well we</font>

344
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:28,110
know a lot about<font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> application attacks</font>

345
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:32,639
because we get paid to hack things and

346
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:34,230
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm that's interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but again this</font>

347
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,939
is all local<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we want to be able</font>

348
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,139
to do things remotely right that's the

349
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:45,180
scary part

350
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:49,259
so who knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear what HTML stands for</font>

351
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:51,540
yes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> hypertext markup language</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is how</font>

352
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:54,089
the web<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser how the internet works</font>

353
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,129
or how<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know when you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

354
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:59,160
surfing the web which is now an old term

355
00:13:56,129 --> 00:14:01,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">I you know are looking at websites that</font>

356
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,449
those are mostly powered by HTML<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

357
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:05,160
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of you know HTML and have</font>

358
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:08,309
written some<font color="#CCCCCC"> websites probably even</font>

359
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,019
earlier than<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so just to give</font>

360
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:13,319
an example of how that can kind of go

361
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,939
pad<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a pretty basic example so</font>

362
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:17,430
what happens is there's this<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript</font>

363
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:19,498
part of the top and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes some input</font>

364
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:21,689
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> expects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we can see there</font>

365
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:24,779
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's expecting a name which is what</font>

366
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:27,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">far name means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> far name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> input</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron</font>

367
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:28,499
my name and then what happens is when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

368
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,670
visit that page

369
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:33,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">I the code of the page in HTML says</font>

370
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,809
hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin</font>

371
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:40,019
welcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> roots but how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go bad</font>

372
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:43,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">so instead of my name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron what if i</font>

373
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:46,259
put in there some other HTML<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i put in</font>

374
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:51,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">a blink and the blink tag does obviously</font>

375
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:56,220
make it blink and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i put in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> h1 and that</font>

376
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:58,079
makes it big<font color="#E5E5E5"> so does anybody know what's</font>

377
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,829
going to happen when<font color="#E5E5E5"> now when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i visit</font>

378
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:04,859
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> site</font>

379
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:06,839
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> now when i visit the site</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

380
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,569
going to say hello and then josh is

381
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be really big and blinking and</font>

382
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:14,339
so you know if this was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other</font>

383
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:17,100
website and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wasn't it wasn't intended</font>

384
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:18,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was my website and</font>

385
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,699
he could just put his name on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

386
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:23,639
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might make me angry</font>

387
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:25,258
so let's talk a little bit about some of

388
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,110
the social media applications that are

389
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:30,449
on the TV<font color="#E5E5E5"> so just like your smartphone</font>

390
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">smart tvs are pretty popular for use</font>

391
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:34,469
with social applications and all the

392
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,780
typical social media applications are

393
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">avail</font>

you're gonna have lots of friends and

something called remote content

that was slightly more<font color="#CCCCCC"> illicit more</font>

delicious than saying hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's up and</font>

00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,950
put that into social media applications

of that social media application or

432
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,790
would just show up as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> text you know</font>

script alert<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey what's up and script</font>

confused<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they were online at the</font>

had no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying to them so</font>

439
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:16,689
before we actually get into the attack

440
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,359
itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's take a look at some of the</font>

441
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:21,760
the social social media networks that we

442
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,389
wanted to take a look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're thinking</font>

443
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:28,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">the smart TV is a really great platform</font>

444
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:30,010
for video communication for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font>

445
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,840
tried to do like<font color="#E5E5E5"> facetime or skype on</font>

446
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:33,490
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone you know that sometimes it's</font>

447
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,350
difficult to like keep yourself in the

448
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">frame or like flip cameras and turn</font>

449
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,750
around so that the person you're talking

450
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,850
to you can actually see what you want

451
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,080
them to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the TV</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually</font>

452
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,300
mounted to the wall it's got a really

453
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,280
nice camera big screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you just sit</font>

454
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">on your couch and talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's a really</font>

455
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,399
great platform for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're thinking</font>

456
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay it's really</font>

457
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,810
likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people start using skype or</font>

458
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">or something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pulled into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that on this</font>

459
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:57,310
platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> so of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're asking</font>

460
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:59,050
what's the best target<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in this case</font>

461
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's skype</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's important to note</font>

462
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:03,520
that on the issues that we're going to

463
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:06,220
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't actually issues that</font>

464
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,230
were within<font color="#E5E5E5"> skype itself the issues were</font>

465
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,570
within how the application on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Smart</font>

466
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,770
TV that<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to skype was built</font>

467
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's an important distinction</font>

468
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:17,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">there so skype has access to the camera</font>

469
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its got all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these are remote content</font>

470
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:21,160
injection areas throughout the messages

471
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:23,020
and chat<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's really cool is that</font>

472
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,700
there's automatic<font color="#CCCCCC"> signing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> capability so</font>

473
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:28,060
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were able to do something bad to</font>

474
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,410
it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in wi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you had a user who</font>

475
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,429
automatically signed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

476
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn the TV on</font>

477
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,700
there's a good chance you could probably

478
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:37,810
leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> go down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there and have it we run</font>

479
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:39,310
every time they log in so when we were

480
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,840
looking at skype<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we found was that</font>

481
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,669
there were those injection

482
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,040
vulnerabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> just about everywhere</font>

483
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:46,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we're going to take a quick look at</font>

484
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,940
some of the pictures from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on but</font>

485
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,919
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> boiled down to you even if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

486
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:54,490
was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> using the keyboard and I input</font>

487
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:57,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">script our javascript HTML into my name</font>

488
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">and/or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in my profile name or to a</font>

489
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,730
contact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was adding that would</font>

490
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,560
actually show up in the application

491
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:08,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at that</font>

492
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:10,990
so this thing is still see that on in

493
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,940
the middle of the name here<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's an</font>

494
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,250
image tag which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an HTML tag that</font>

495
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,560
supposed to download<font color="#CCCCCC"> images</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

496
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,030
when it fails it shows the default image

497
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what you see up there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put an</font>

498
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:23,110
image tag<font color="#E5E5E5"> my name and everything oh hey</font>

499
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:25,690
this is you know this is really cool

500
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,490
research on<font color="#CCCCCC"> its it's a bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as far as</font>

501
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,740
security goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> but this is something that</font>

502
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:32,440
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to begin to and then</font>

503
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:36,160
remotely<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we found was that when my</font>

504
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:39,550
user<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are smart</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TV user and</font>

505
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,410
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my mood message or status was</font>

506
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:46,000
updated to include that image tag<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

507
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:48,250
also showed up on the screen so let's

508
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,960
have some fun with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the top here</font>

509
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,170
you see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moon message that we had to</font>

510
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:56,380
set<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in skype</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that would then show up</font>

511
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:58,840
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> our are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smart TV user and what it did</font>

512
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,940
was it said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript</font>

513
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want you to download</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this other</font>

514
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">javascript</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> file from our website and in</font>

515
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,550
the bottom there you actually see that

516
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript code</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you don't really</font>

517
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,600
need to know too much about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

519
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,590
very bottom one of things we found with

00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:17,860
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> API system that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about</font>

521
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:20,649
earlier was that we could actually call

522
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:23,979
this the file<font color="#CCCCCC"> plugin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that copy command</font>

523
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:25,870
and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> execute system commands</font>

524
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,000
like we're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> command</font>

525
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:30,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">line console and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're actually able</font>

526
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,850
to turn off the operating system within

527
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:36,010
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> smart TV so if we change our status</font>

528
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:38,230
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> send you a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> message on skype</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> while</font>

529
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smart TV you'd see it for a</font>

530
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,770
split second and then your TV<font color="#CCCCCC"> reboot</font>

531
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just silly and fun and you know</font>

532
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a month it's a mild annoyance</font>

533
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,870
so let's see what else we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do</font>

534
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:52,060
that's a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know more</font>

535
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:54,969
evil<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are our the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video skype was</font>

536
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:57,399
we pulled down more code<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this one</font>

537
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:59,560
actually was able to use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that</font>

538
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">API</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call we looked at earlier to get my</font>

539
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,260
storage info

540
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,209
the weird thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that one was that</font>

541
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,050
not only did return<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you store your</font>

542
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,700
stuff

543
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:09,669
it also<font color="#CCCCCC"> return the username and password</font>

544
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:14,560
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> skype user and if we put that</font>

545
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:16,390
into an image tag and told<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> skype</font>

546
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,250
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you should get a image</font>

547
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:21,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">after image from our website that we</font>

548
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:23,500
control and image name is this

549
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:26,800
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would get a log on our</font>

550
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,620
web server that said that this IP

551
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,750
address the<font color="#CCCCCC"> skype user on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> downloaded</font>

552
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,280
this is calling for this image and in

553
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:36,250
our logs we would see your username and

554
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,910
password<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's that's a bit more</font>

555
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,840
evil

556
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:42,940
all right reserved<font color="#CCCCCC"> a room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

557
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">drought just like you know the social</font>

558
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,380
media applications the browser is also a

559
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:51,550
big tax surface<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to look at</font>

560
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:53,890
and so we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we have some way</font>

561
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:56,530
of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting into the browser's code</font>

562
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:57,700
just like with<font color="#E5E5E5"> skype and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he didn't go</font>

563
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:59,139
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a bit more</font>

564
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,990
detailed and we're kind of getting low

565
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,700
on time<font color="#E5E5E5"> but essentially there's an API</font>

566
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,850
that we can call that that had a

567
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,380
vulnerability before we reported it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

568
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:11,290
essentially what that does is it allows

569
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,660
us to open the file the controls where

570
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns settings are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

571
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,200
resolved<font color="#CCCCCC"> comp</font>

572
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:20,530
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the trick is that those dots</font>

573
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">lashes actually make it open up</font>

574
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:24,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">directories from where it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you</font>

575
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:28,630
think about it you know you have your

576
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:30,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">your c drive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or your root FS or and all</font>

577
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,690
the way down in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's files and</font>

578
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,809
so what we did is we told it to read<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

579
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:37,780
file from here<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then the name in</font>

580
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:40,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">inside the name we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> included the code of</font>

581
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:44,620
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> file system to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and told it to read a</font>

582
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,809
file that was way up here so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> lets</font>

583
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,409
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the name of where it asks for</font>

584
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:49,120
things

585
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:51,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh where they are on the internet so</font>

586
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,300
when you go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> google.com you know your</font>

587
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:58,480
your TV says<font color="#E5E5E5"> where's google com to your</font>

588
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:00,370
router and says okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's this IP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

589
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,780
what we did is we said no<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

590
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to ask your router</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore you're</font>

591
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to ask us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so now we</font>

592
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:09,520
can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay google com oh yeah that's</font>

593
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:10,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">gotta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so there's some other things</font>

594
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,360
we can do from the browser so let's see

595
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,710
how the camera stuff works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have to</font>

596
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:25,449
pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the video it's going to take a</font>

597
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:26,920
second while Aaron's pulling that up on

598
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,970
one thing that's important to note<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 is</font>

599
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that because we disclose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

600
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:35,710
responsibly everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> showing</font>

601
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:40,990
you here has been fixed

602
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:43,690
so what you'll see here is the site that

603
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,309
we build and then in a quick second

604
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,410
the camera is going to actually pop up

605
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:49,720
inside the browser and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to</font>

606
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:51,309
show you what it's looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

607
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,470
actually looking at a co-worker a friend

608
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:54,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">of mine and he's going to bounce out of</font>

609
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:58,210
the screen right because he doesn't want

610
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,620
to see himself on TV and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll play</font>

611
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:02,200
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> more time because it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kinda was going</font>

612
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,360
too quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm essentially there is</font>

613
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,600
the camera viewing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

614
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:12,820
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what the camera sees</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

615
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:14,199
know he realizes it and and he fails<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

616
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,570
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to do some extra work to actually</font>

617
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,550
have that video show up on the screen in

618
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:20,889
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> real-life attack that would actually</font>

619
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:22,090
be hidden behind the browser and you

620
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:25,750
would never know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the camera</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font>

621
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:27,550
on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely talk about</font>

622
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,039
responsible disclosure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's it's</font>

623
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of</font>

624
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:32,389
a big deal in the industry now

625
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:34,609
essentially responsible disclosure is

626
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:36,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know researchers like us come up</font>

627
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:41,178
with you know we perform this research

628
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:43,219
and we say you know we provide the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

629
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:44,509
findings to the company and say here's

630
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,909
how to reproduce it

631
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:48,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">here's how you should fix it talk if you</font>

632
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:50,539
want to talk to us more<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go for</font>

633
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:52,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but essentially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to let</font>

634
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:54,408
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we talk about it all we're</font>

635
00:24:52,489 --> 00:24:57,229
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> let you guys fix it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it</font>

636
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:58,429
really helps keep people safer and

637
00:24:57,229 --> 00:25:00,590
there's this other thing called the bug

638
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:03,559
bounty and so essentially what a bug

639
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:05,029
bounty is is it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay instead of</font>

640
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:06,859
just having you know you provide those

641
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:09,649
findings<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company will not actually</font>

642
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:12,590
pay you some money for finding those on

643
00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:15,408
your on your kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> on time and so both</font>

644
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">Samsung and Facebook have bug bounties</font>

645
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:19,039
and we didn't submit to any bug<font color="#CCCCCC"> bounties</font>

646
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:22,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> follow you know 15 or so</font>

647
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:24,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">findings that we had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but we're going to</font>

648
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:25,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is after this we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font>

649
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring the TV that we brought that</font>

650
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,109
somewhere down there<font color="#CCCCCC"> over to the other</font>

651
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:31,460
room<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're going to let you have you</font>
