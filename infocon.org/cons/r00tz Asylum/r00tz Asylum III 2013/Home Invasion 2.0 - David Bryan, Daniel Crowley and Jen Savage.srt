1
00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:05,460
I done so on this is the home invasion
2.0 talk

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,860
I so home invasion 1.00 would be like

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,690
somebody busting in a window in and
going in but now there's

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,570
up with the ad in a smart home
technologies or at least the

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,740
it widespread I am that the fact that
they're getting put it more homes all

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,299
the time

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,300
means that what some things in your home
are going to be connected and this trend

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,189
looks like it's only going to grow over
the years

9
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:32,259
so it's going to be the case it is
already the case that you can hack your

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:32,759
home

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,110
%uh or somebody else is something on who
you are and how many

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,469
a ethics you have on so

13
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:43,370
the don't do that yeah unless you have
permission

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,829
and then to do that on don't do without
permission

15
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,100
so on the first gonna talk about who we
are

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,640
and why should listen to us as opposed
to I'm some guy playing slots

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,559
and so I'm Dana Crowley and I work for

18
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:01,050
Trustwave in the spider live steam as
Managing Consultant and pretty much all

19
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,140
I do all day is great code

20
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,040
i'm jennifer savage I'm a software
engineer

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,090
tabbed out the mall so their security
contact I we make a mobile app that lets

22
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,040
people pay for their restaurant tabs
using their cell phones so it's a heart

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,240
problem in security

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,610
i'm david Browne I'm

25
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,580
senior security consultant with trust
respect our labs my day job is to you

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,009
break into things so

27
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:31,430
I read talked a little bit about what
we're doing here but um we took a look

28
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,880
at a whole bunch both a different smart
home technology is different devices

29
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,839
that hook up to your home network and
control physical things

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,079
in your home or at least are sorted
non-traditional

31
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,589
never connected stuff so i connect to a
network but is not something like a

32
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,600
computer or a smartphone

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,000
so arm as anybody here like science
fiction

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,060
awesome so

35
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,070
my favor kinda science fiction is called
dystopian science fiction

36
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,079
and dystopian science fiction is abouts

37
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:10,079
describing the world where there's some
technology I did exist or has yet to

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,729
exist

39
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,060
but that is being used in a way that's
really awful

40
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,250
on so for instance I 1984

41
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,590
is a dystopian science fiction on

42
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,940
although it's not really science fiction
per se but

43
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,280
you know at at that time it was Britain
in 1948

44
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,290
just inverted the two numbers to get
1984

45
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,510
on their I don't know that the

46
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,940
but technology existed to perform mass
surveillance kinda like

47
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,370
what is going on today on so

48
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,930
yeah anyway so within really heed that
warning and we didn't

49
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,099
heed the warnings up about us the smart
home and the potential for attacks

50
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:52,720
against it

51
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,470
so um at least that's what it looks like
based on our research in bowl

52
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,060
all talk about that a little bit more
but anyway we attempted to hack a whole

53
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,980
bunch devices that you can find in
various rooms at the home

54
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,010
and there's a lot of is are ones that we
didn't cover

55
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,640
there's a lot out there some that we did
cover that we're not going to do for

56
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,339
interest at times we only have thirty
minutes but does just a sampling

57
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,909
so what's up there right now you can
find lakhs

58
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:21,769
thermostats bridges toilets lights

59
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:25,620
and toys the course and I'm we tested

60
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,319
some something like nine devices for our
researcher only going to present three

61
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,409
in the interest of time here today but
arm there's actually a lot of work to be

62
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:36,670
done in the field because there are
plenty more devices me

63
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,480
didn't get to you in the future though
there's going to be entire smart cities

64
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,768
and there's one being built in South
Korea right now called song doe

65
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:48,620
would really like to go there see it in
play with it and get permission from

66
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,319
Cisco

67
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,319
was doing they're not working to do you
know to

68
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,689
do any kind of testing on their networks
but I am

69
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:59,450
its you for me I'm a technology
enthusiast

70
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,349
and I find it of them that these things
are being built

71
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:06,518
but i wanna make sure that I'm see using
them and

72
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:13,069
so that's why we do this so I'm gonna
talk to you about

73
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:17,048
eighty toy money that was in my
daughter's room for some time I have a

74
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,388
I'm a daughter she's almost usually to
next month

75
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:23,759
and I bought this bunny rabbit because

76
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,639
it has in addition to being able to play
music and movies years and have an LED

77
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,449
in its belly button and the ability to
read RFID chips in

78
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:36,090
little companion toys are ID chips in
them the interacting

79
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,258
all I kinda South it also has the camera

80
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:42,949
right so I could be in the other room
and I could check on my daughter

81
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:47,090
without ever leaving call the nanny cam
when you have a baby or

82
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,638
very unpopular it's really important to
have the ability to to check on you

83
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,680
can't write

84
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,630
I'm and has a maker on right so

85
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:01,110
I am. 10 I was very time deprives when
she was first born

86
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,590
and and this that sort of thing goes on
for about a year where they

87
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,250
require all your time and I didn't have
time to fully test the security of the

88
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,169
device

89
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:13,590
and I'm kicking myself now because I
went back in it has to the security of

90
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,039
this

91
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:17,550
device for our talk and I'm it

92
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,080
im it's not terribly secure I'm

93
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,710
so with let's go over the on our
abilities that I found

94
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,340
what's funny is it's more secure than a
lot easier their devices we tested and

95
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,090
so the others they tested books

96
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,380
up to door locks cell he actually in
some ways they didn't think about

97
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,400
security when it signed it in other ways
really missed the mark

98
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,630
so I'm the first thing is in order to
start this

99
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,169
its wifi connected right I in order to
set this money up to

100
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:48,889
talked your WiFi network you have to go
to be carrots website

101
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:53,110
an answer in your WiFi networks SSID at
the Met Your Number

102
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,190
and password into their website Anne
request goes

103
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,460
unencrypted him im playin taxed so is a
I'm

104
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,818
to their servers and that was the first
problem

105
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:08,100
the issue about is you can't use drop
are not connection if you're on the

106
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,380
local network and

107
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,370
got that information arm or the other
issue is that

108
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,419
they could be storing everybody's member

109
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:19,659
credentials on their servers and I have
no way of knowing

110
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,819
right I'm

111
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:26,430
now in order for the bunnies
functionality I'm

112
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,110
ovitz a programming everything in order
to you our to colo

113
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,259
all of its functions he's a man called
AP Nebi option

114
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,650
I'm programming interface or got
anything

115
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,109
so they use this API army has a one-time
use

116
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,180
outspoken which you knowi

117
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,280
I'm basically mmm the application talks
the carrot servers gets a temporary

118
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,929
token they can use just for that session

119
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,960
and then d carrot servers know not to
allow any calls to the body because all

120
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,500
the calls go from

121
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,789
you know the application question to the
carrot servers

122
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,370
and you the money that's how it works

123
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,520
and you and you ate sOooo these

124
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,139
requests are also hopping on happening I
think abt it so they're not using us

125
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,069
it's alright

126
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:18,940
so if you have your browser opening you
go type and you are all you type in each

127
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,190
TTP

128
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,130
colon slash slash at that that's without
as a solid he do

129
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,409
ish et/pt ass calls oshkosh thats

130
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,919
with as a cell so that back connection

131
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:35,389
if it is GPS is in cryptid if it's
missing yes it's not in cryptid

132
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,860
I'm so be connection did the API calls

133
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,690
I use is completely uninterrupted on

134
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,780
and that means it can be. straps on
eavesdropped on you

135
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,049
additionally be setup package to set up
the wifi

136
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,860
if the download it and then loaded onto
the bunnies USB Drive

137
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,330
that also download also happens
uninterrupted

138
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,460
you something called code signing which
is that way a cryptographically insuring

139
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,919
that berm the code to get executed is
the actually

140
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,620
intended code however there's a way
around back good signing

141
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,620
so and that we're on that could training
is something called

142
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,860
papon model hijacking how many have you
have worked with pipe on a ever tried

143
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,009
out papen

144
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:28,199
of them there's at least a few kids of
them

145
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,209
eitan if you don't know any programming
languages is a a decently nice

146
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,359
starter language in it will teach you
good coating habits as well

147
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,750
so yeah I can definitely recommend
python is this entire time with you

148
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,860
if you're interested in learning when I
rode papon

149
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,560
what's code signing you nothing I'm

150
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,380
I'm asking you I roadside I do you
explain it

151
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,120
are a hidden it is so when you thank you

152
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,160
basically could send you the way of
preventing

153
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,829
coat well the use a bit is to prevent
good that was not intended for running

154
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,240
I many you see yeah sue

155
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,290
I think it will be that have us

156
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:13,829
%um home so okay so great here you can
see I'm eavesdropping on the request

157
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,890
I'm and it says get API carrots webcam

158
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,410
action video excedrin there's that
interactive I D that's the token I was

159
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,199
talking about

160
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,330
here you can see how many of you guys
have seen web request before

161
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,140
okay sorry great so what she was showing
there was actually a

162
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,100
a raw web request so normally you you
use your web browser

163
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,860
support the webpage great on the back
end

164
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,440
this is what what you'd see is this web
request

165
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,459
this is I'm basically opening what's
called a socket

166
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:51,060
to the web server requesting his data

167
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,599
and then the web server goes oh okay
I've got programs inside here

168
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,940
that will pull the data up and send it
back to to the web browser

169
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,260
rate ratio it here to visit

170
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,209
something like got to be W W dot to dot
com slash

171
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:09,279
I dan underscore Crowley which by the
way as me on twitter

172
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,459
on here in the host field you would see
WWW dot Twitter dot com

173
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:17,939
on some web servers run more than one
domain so it's important to have that in

174
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,390
there so that they can

175
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:23,910
send you the appropriate content and
then slashed an underscore Crowley we go

176
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,680
here

177
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,750
so that the this part here

178
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,380
worth seeing get whatever and then
telling the

179
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,870
telling you to the web server HTTP
version on

180
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,240
this this part here up until the
question mark is

181
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,500
at these traditionally used to say this
is the file

182
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,350
that I wanna grab of though the web
server and and what directory

183
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,810
and then everything after that is this
series a additional bits of information

184
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:56,018
for the web server to process I when
handling whatever request you made

185
00:10:56,019 --> 00:11:00,040
so in this case Prince is here we have
action equals video

186
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,610
so this is pretty easy to understand
word for telling it here you know here's

187
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,209
as such API carrots webcams they were
we're requesting webcam functionality

188
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:12,768
where the action is video as opposed to
like botha which the wet the

189
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:16,050
parents can also do

190
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,069
so insure its way over he crimes and
servers the

191
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,600
communicating with each other any
standardized passion

192
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,029
and and remember we talked about
encryption right corruption would

193
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:27,800
protect

194
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,040
this request going across the network so
that someone couldn't a surly intercept

195
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,279
or eavesdrop it right even if
eavesdropped on the traffic

196
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,269
it wouldn't be able to understand it
because it would be incurred too great

197
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:40,649
right the value there for retracted by
The

198
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,050
gives us permission to do whatever we
want to do

199
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,550
with the carrots unit so the fact that
we can see that

200
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:52,180
if we're all listening on the network is
really bad because that means now we can

201
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,239
control the

202
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,180
the bunny it so this is a big problem

203
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,060
so here you can see I've taken not
request I've plugged it into UAB I dot

204
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,399
carrots are common web browser and then
just

205
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,670
handed at seem request to the under the
URL

206
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,209
and I think one other things that with
you don't remember a video

207
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:14,969
be is this request was originally
initiated on a smartphone

208
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:19,290
the ideas that you take your phone
Morgan 00 show me the bunnies video

209
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,569
great and so it goes out makes this
request

210
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,120
on encrypt it in the clear which you can
then grab

211
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,060
if you're if you're listening on the
network grabbin gone plug in your web

212
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,839
browser

213
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,880
and now the app has nothing to do with
that

214
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,139
that particular session so I mean I just

215
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:39,930
password to you a charm video we have

216
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:46,930
up this in action

217
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:51,099
here a few laps

218
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,180
schools last

219
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,989
its and years

220
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,529
I house eavesdropping on crass

221
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:07,050
over here

222
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:11,079
crowd host

223
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:15,109
one-time stroke for the night

224
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,899
sash to capture your

225
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:27,899
track

226
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,960
for first cheese

227
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,720
house your yeah here

228
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,110
ash care

229
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,130
and ski

230
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:53,130
East can match those video to now

231
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,100
on she musings he struck carrots

232
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,660
handy dandy I

233
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,819
so

234
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,250
issues key chopping on carrots

235
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:20,250
twice now if you happen to have a carrot
at home

236
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,439
don't despair I have created something I
call a bunny break it's like a jailbreak

237
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,700
except for the rabbit

238
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,580
to get it to run your own could not
connect to the carrot server

239
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,400
I'm so I in the intrusive time

240
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,490
I i'm I'm good as get the details on n

241
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,440
but after the talk if you have a carats
come talk to me and I'll show you how

242
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:42,860
did

243
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,300
okay at work it just interested

244
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,800
so um a mother

245
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,240
among other things we hacked the toilet
and I say the toilet but there's

246
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,100
actually a whole bunch of these things

247
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,400
this is just one of several smart
toilets out there

248
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:04,530
om and this particular one because we
don't have six thousand dollars to speed

249
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,740
that yes this is a six thousand dollar
toilet

250
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,900
from him from Japan good a course

251
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,329
so so we are we didn't buy the toilet
but we did

252
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,960
download the Android application that
used to control it so you download this

253
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,540
Android application not any Android
smartphone

254
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,319
%ah ands the you pair it with your toys
but

255
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,370
and then you can control all the
functions that the toilet including

256
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,940
music playback

257
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,760
on there's like a a hair dryer there's a
big day

258
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,770
if you don't know what the day is it
shoots water up

259
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,860
from the toilet it see it

260
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,440
you don't really see that around here
but I but there's one other monies and

261
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,700
it's remotely controllable

262
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,410
it's a anti expensive toy it is a fancy
expensive toilet

263
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,910
and it's got a whole bunch of features
that you can control

264
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,810
through this smartphone application so
we took a look at the smartphone

265
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,469
application what we found was

266
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,900
there is no place to set up a username
and password or enter username and

267
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,620
password

268
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,970
and when the pair's via bluetooth %uh

269
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,650
it has a hard-coded pin %uh 0000

270
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,560
and so this means that anybody with an
Android smartphone

271
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,219
and be my sad as application can control
any one of these

272
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,050
I toilets and he re here you see the

273
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,439
call to exact a ring which is like a

274
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,730
Bluetooth subroutine that they together
just to pair with the toilet

275
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,040
on and also there's some really weird
icons and stuff

276
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,670
on in the application and so

277
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,390
I understand why its poo ans

278
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,939
you know it's from Japan's like that
blushing

279
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:47,220
cheeks and everything I got the japanese
you but I have no idea what he's got a

280
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,310
police hat on

281
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,489
I have no idea why this is a policeman
on

282
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,700
but you now but there is it was this one
was up very very simple

283
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,940
attack and I'm gonna take it easy David
Bryan is an explain another

284
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,580
a tragically simple attack on being
snubbed

285
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,189
yeah so the instant home was a is a is a
home automation gateway

286
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:11,380
I am the body her home automation before

287
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:16,180
you have so home automation basically
allows you to control your lights

288
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:21,709
control your locks sure your garage
doors things like that by putting in

289
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:24,829
is little devices this is an example of
one

290
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:28,620
plugs in you know in this case it plugs
in front of your lights

291
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,489
and will control your life rain
internally I

292
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,070
on and off and so

293
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,240
home automation gateway switcher
becoming

294
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,260
are cheaper and more cost-effective
which means that people will buy them

295
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,320
are being deployed in this case

296
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,980
II I purchased a in stay on her back in
December last year

297
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,380
I am and discovered that it had some
issues

298
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,530
com applied in my network pulled out my
smartphone

299
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,800
you know it's got a nap great so the app
has

300
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,550
no concept up if there's an HTTPS earn
HTTP on the application right

301
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,570
this is its been presented to you

302
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:15,830
I'm in a smartphone way it's not been
presented to you through a browser

303
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,949
pulled up the app and then ran a packet
capture on my firewall

304
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,670
my my Gateway at home so he monitored
the traffic

305
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:29,710
its you dapper yeah I base to monitor
the traffic between my smartphone

306
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:34,630
and the in Stone Harbor and discover
that there is no encryption

307
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,110
and there's no authentication
authorization that'd

308
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,719
say but you know what I think Asian is

309
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,720
you tell me

310
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,830
what's that

311
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,240
yeah user identity so I username and
password

312
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,380
rate so there's authentication there's
authorization

313
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,810
and rolls great is is there

314
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,720
these are integral to any sort of
information security component

315
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,270
um authentication if it's not there that
means that

316
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,470
anybody can go and talk to that device
right

317
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,290
so that means it's if you set up this
the since John Harbin the way it was

318
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,629
intended to be set up

319
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,620
which is to have it open to the Internet

320
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,790
and that means that anybody in the
Internet can connect to it

321
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,040
they could potentially come in such to
take a look at what you're doing

322
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,260
what you have on your your your device
on this is actually a screenshot from

323
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,990
%uh Forbes article

324
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:37,120
where the reporter went and

325
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,699
did data a search on the internet for
this kinda stuff

326
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,820
it she found it just listed on Google
right after hearing about a research

327
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,010
ship after at the these kinda vices are

328
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:52,129
are indexed in Google and there's also

329
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,370
showed an so anybody who searched google
through this

330
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,449
good find it in turns me play Ghana from

331
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,679
move our yeah she actually called the
guy up in Oregon and was like hey

332
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:05,770
so do that I don't know you but I'm from
Forbes

333
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:10,090
and I think I can control is up in your
house guys like

334
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:15,090
her head go ahead and try I guess and so
she put the lights on often is like

335
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,330
well how bout that the hood

336
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,710
sorry now keep in mind what did she do
there

337
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,570
she asked for permission yeah really
important that

338
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:29,120
yep so if she hadn't asked for
permission started controlling someone's

339
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,850
lights

340
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,949
there's a really good chance that yet
you could have bad things happened here

341
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,179
hikers the end up in jail if they don't
ask for permission

342
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:40,560
really important to alright

343
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,780
so I'm

344
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,370
what are the other things that so they
they came out with a six the the next

345
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,379
model has

346
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,830
some form of medication and has was
called base64 encoded

347
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:57,490
authentication so be 64 is literally
encoding scheme

348
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,220
which means that they take in transition
that the plain text characters in a

349
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,770
username and password

350
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:05,870
to something that can be transferred
across the internet without

351
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:10,199
issue I'm but it's not cryptid so that
means it's

352
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,470
reversible rain anybody can easily

353
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:18,020
change the plain text or that the
encoded characters to plaintext

354
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,090
at their if they're in between the
connection can see that traffic because

355
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,070
remember I said it was

356
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,560
on encrypt it going across the internet
which means that if anybody can see that

357
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,379
traffic

358
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,820
and see what's inside it

359
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,678
I'm one of the things they've done as
they basically said up to be a

360
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,760
a a static password based on the device
id: which is pretty bad

361
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,870
so so it's kassebaum yeah well dur

362
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,489
a little demo here I think we're I wrote
to have time

363
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,780
were probably this art so

364
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,540
so the light is on right now d this

365
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,500
are and dave is going to issue a Request

366
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,679
to turn it off I'm not through the app
which is the intended use

367
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:06,620
but using a a well-known testing tool
called

368
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:10,600
burp suite alright so you could do this

369
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,760
term behalf ok but one of their base
either

370
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,950
so student he turned on there you go

371
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:23,040
alright so the light is on but so what's
happening here

372
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,610
is we're actually generating are
creating a get request this is um

373
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,629
what's called burp suite burr sweet is a
a tool that we can use

374
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:36,140
to generate or create HTTP HTTPS
requests

375
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,679
across the network now I could be easily
do this by just using telnet

376
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,929
rape or netcat or any one of those tools

377
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:47,679
which would allow me to open up a
portent send date added:

378
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,740
but purse week i'd give us some
convenience factors to it makes it a lot

379
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,060
quicker lot easier for us do this

380
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,428
if you want to start getting into web
application hacking I highly recommend

381
00:22:57,429 --> 00:22:59,550
getting the free version A Burke sweet

382
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:03,080
it doesn't have all the stuff in the the
professional version

383
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,980
but a its it's really fantastic comes
with mister this step

384
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,120
that you need um and thank you can
really do all the stuff you need

385
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,090
with just the free version but there's
just some nice things about the

386
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,389
anyway so a.m. I'd say if you want to
learn

387
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,820
even if you just wanna learn about HTTP
and how the web works

388
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,100
on the back end you know behind what's
going on your web browser

389
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,449
just get perks we ends tell your browser
to use it as a proxy

390
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,610
on their shit there's definitely
instructions out there if you google for

391
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,189
it

392
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,150
and you can just see like as you make
request do various parts the web that

393
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,280
use all the time

394
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,500
what it looks like in the back end with
the communication actually looks like

395
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,210
greats you can you can learn how these
things communicate with each other

396
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:50,530
and then you can do with that and try to
disrupt their communication

397
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:54,399
but only with beans you controls only
web sites you own

398
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,500
only devices you own so what's going on
here

399
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,370
is where were telling the web server hey
we're going to do it get request there's

400
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,189
a couple different

401
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,520
I'm methods you can use one of them is

402
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,950
get post head a

403
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,860
mom options a all sorts of things web
doubt

404
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,949
these are different protocol different
ways of talking to the web server

405
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,270
with the GET request basically we're
saying hey we're gonna get this

406
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,980
this component for this area on this web
server

407
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,900
first thing it says is okay get slashed
three sus last three

408
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,600
is a program inside up the insti- on
home

409
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:38,600
right and then question mark question
mark means that everything after that

410
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,390
see you you find out what is all mean
just by playing with their crest in

411
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,900
figuring it out right so everything
after that the question mark

412
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,350
is the parameters that were sending to
this program rate

413
00:24:55,350 --> 00:25:00,260
and I happen to know that this is a
hatter that basically says

414
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,370
are eight haitians gender-based wake up
I'm gonna send you something

415
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,678
than this one this these 3

416
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,890
I'm bites are called the insti- and
device

417
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:17,179
ID so each device has its own ID or or

418
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:20,450
I wanna say it's like a Mac address: but
it's half the length of the Mac dress

419
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,280
it's

420
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,918
24 bits and then you've got

421
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:28,540
a separator and then a command so this
is

422
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,990
12 basically says hey turn this device

423
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,429
on rate because we set our on

424
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:38,429
and then FF is just a buffer to fill out
the buffer

425
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:41,830
and then equals I equals three is also
just to

426
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:46,939
terminate that command so we send this
request

427
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,179
without authentication authorization
this means that

428
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:53,590
anybody can do this from anywhere

429
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,899
and you wanna display it turn on not
begin

430
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,650
couple time I think it's fun the

431
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:04,220
so we turn light off tonight on

432
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,230
and as you can see from taking a look
there's just very little information in

433
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:08,669
this

434
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:12,909
command here it's a little bit hard to
understand the cousins done is doing

435
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:14,690
some weird

436
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:19,020
things like has not really so much human
readable that you consider taking a

437
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,810
party play with it in a

438
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:25,020
um but you can see that there's no well
as we broke it down for you there's no

439
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,379
user name password no secret information
here

440
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,929
and all the all that you really need to
know is the

441
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:34,980
a that 3 that three bite

442
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,890
a device id: and actually there's a web
interface exposed

443
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,360
on which we saw earlier on the picture
from the Forbes article

444
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,770
on which shows what it looks like in
this will just disclose all the device

445
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,800
ID's

446
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,600
and it's actually really easy to do
because all you need to do is just

447
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,050
find these things out there and then
visited with the web browser and click

448
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:57,928
buttons

449
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:01,440
and you're turning people lights on/off
it's very very easy

450
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,600
so um showy for

451
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,260
thinking how we doing on time over cut

452
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,419
where we are five minutes right great

453
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:14,880
um it was Duke your name

454
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,340
irate so we also did a the bunny
breakdown

455
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,510
oh yes so actually real quick I've
diverting loaded on my

456
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:27,440
bunny break goodyear and its on this USB
Drive

457
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,700
I'm just gonna plug it in and turn it on
you guys can see

458
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,970
so this is what the body re looks like
in action

459
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,929
I'm basically the first thing that
happens is it

460
00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:43,240
loads up the Carrizo us it's like a
madman X-ray

461
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,690
and I'm you after a moment it's gonna

462
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,690
notice there's the USB Drive and USB
Drive contains

463
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:53,870
the auto run by I scripts it's a

464
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,050
a Python script that they use to set up
the wifi

465
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,070
I found a corner ability not script that
we didn't

466
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:03,550
ass but I'm it allows

467
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:10,270
it so here it is it's trying to connect
to wipe

468
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,330
on

469
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,620
it allows me to replace the
functionality of the script with my own

470
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,719
script that I wrote my on and this
script just

471
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,880
runs and plays an mp3 file I'm

472
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,750
but you can we could do it over I do a
variety of other things

473
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:32,450
before

474
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:39,450
takes a while

475
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:43,180
these are pretty low power devices so
they tend to be a little slow

476
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:49,920
I'm going to connect to the internet

477
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,740
it thinks it's running out around my
price good during the

478
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,960
it is running man I Pixar

479
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,559
fun

480
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,970
my you

481
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:07,399
so

482
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:10,928
I think that does it for our
demonstrations in our presentation so

483
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:11,990
will be around for

484
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:15,769
questions a do we have any questions
just

485
00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:22,769
right now or

486
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,309
so I think

487
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:35,730
in was schools what tools are using did
eavesdropper intercept the traffic

488
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:39,620
for WiFi and Bluetooth

489
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,758
says so as first the wifi goes

490
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:45,820
I mean is couple different tools you can
use obviously you have to

491
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,970
be on the WiFi network said may involve
WPA cracking

492
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:54,549
rate I but you know most of it is what's
called

493
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:59,870
TCP dump or Wireshark rate City CP dump
is a command-line tool

494
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,979
that puts the interface what's called
promiscuous mode

495
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,490
or Chris Chris mode does is basically
allow you to listen to

496
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:10,369
anything that's on that that network
interface arm

497
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:13,668
normally network interfaces will ignore
anything that's not

498
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:18,539
specifically sort like addressed to them
so imagine that you receive mail for

499
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:20,190
everybody in your neighborhood

500
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,419
but you throw away all the copies of
letters that

501
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:26,419
aren't addressed to you promiscuous mode
means

502
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:30,100
you open up every single letter that you
get regardless of whether or not

503
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:34,498
its given to you so

504
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:38,940
where shark is a great tool as well are
actually a lot about cajuns

505
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,029
young buyers are Wireshark is the almost
home a bus we did a nice interception

506
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:46,039
tool for anything HTTP which ok lotta
stuff

507
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:49,658
works on and again like I said it's a
retool so it's really

508
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:53,399
I definitely recommend it I you pretty
much every day

509
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:56,889
sorry go ahead and then as far as like
network components are

510
00:30:56,889 --> 00:31:01,258
better cap is another tool that allows
you to intercept at the low level there

511
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,779
traffic going between hosts so if you
got something that's

512
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:08,149
an uninterrupted per call going between
two different hosts

513
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:12,469
at our capital I intercept that traffic
pretend to be the gateway

514
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,740
and then for that packet along suit

515
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:22,519
actually an I'm intercepting traffic in
analyzing is a really great way to learn

516
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:25,990
how the web actually works you know
there are a lot of books out there that

517
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,629
tell you how it works and how do you

518
00:31:27,629 --> 00:31:31,658
had use it but they don't necessarily
tell you the whole story

519
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:34,789
on in a it also allows you to you

520
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:38,279
in many cases these tools allow you to
fiddle with the traffic

521
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:42,360
which is how a lot of these attacks are
actually performs

522
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,158
I am so as far as om

523
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,509
as far as wifi you know I'll a

524
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:52,909
bars are wifi with hardware on pretty
much any

525
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:56,000
I laptop will do because you can get an
external

526
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,809
wifi card they can do promiscuous noted
packet injection

527
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:05,600
I there's a alright okay sorry got a
rapid rate

528
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,059
thank you then her it there

529
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:12,509
we will be around for questions for a
little bit I hope you guys go home if

530
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:13,860
you have smart appliances

531
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,570
test then see if you combine months it's
really important work
