<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk for about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five minutes</font>

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,030
about different paths in the computer

security field and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about 25</font>

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">minutes on the research that myself and</font>

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,199
a couple of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> co-workers presented</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,529

<font color="#E5E5E5">wiretapping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cell phones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by running and</font>

11
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:32,159
hacking a small cellular tower and how

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:36,450
we did that and how it can still be done

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:38,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the job that I do is basically</font>

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,860
offensive security<font color="#CCCCCC"> so companies will</font>

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,980
hire me and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> co workers and companies</font>

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">like me to basically hack them we look</font>

17
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,319
at an application or<font color="#E5E5E5"> their network or</font>

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,629
something else and we break in steal all

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,460
of their data and then tell them how we

20
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,760
did it and give recommendations for how

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,309
they should fix it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's pretty fun and</font>

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,218
you don't go to jail or anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

23
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,930
that's advantageous<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are other</font>

24
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,390
types of<font color="#CCCCCC"> perks 22 so we do a lot of</font>

25
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,439
security research<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at something</font>

26
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,479
that's never been broken before

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,449
something that's pretty hard to break

28
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,119
and we try and break it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if we can we</font>

29
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,280
present at<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if we can represent a</font>

30
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">conference is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like DEFCON about what we</font>

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,439
did and what we learned and the process

32
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,780
through it and all that jazz

33
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,899
so let me see if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through some</font>

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,900
slides

35
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so this is the software engineer</font>

36
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,320
oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a criminal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,310
really recommend it but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,649
security researchers<font color="#CCCCCC"> I talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font>

39
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,950
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> penetration testers that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

41
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,180
government has a huge demand for

<font color="#E5E5E5">security people obviously people are</font>

43
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,400
trying to hack the government<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the</font>

44
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,810
time and sometimes when you work for the

00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,670
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get access to stop it you</font>

46
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">can talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's kinda cool i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

47
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:10,080
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i never done it but that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

48
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:12,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">here and then of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's guys and</font>

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">then the other big path is kind of going</font>

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,040
down the academic<font color="#E5E5E5"> crap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so when you go to</font>

51
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:20,519
college you'll panic it like this sense

52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel about how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> academics work and you</font>

53
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,010
get to do very similar research to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

54
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,570
security consultants and<font color="#E5E5E5"> academics</font>

55
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">presented black and presented that count</font>

56
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,650
as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are often under University</font>

57
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:32,880
so they might get some more funding they

58
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,820
generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to work on a full-time</font>

59
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's got advantages and disadvantages</font>

60
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it certainly is another path and</font>

61
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've a number of friends in that</font>

62
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:48,209
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's pretty pretty fun as</font>

63
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:54,930
well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about now is the</font>

64
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:57,570
actual research that we did so what we

65
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,670
did is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> hacked a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> small device</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

66
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,200
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> a femtocell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it looks like a small</font>

67
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,750
wireless router that you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bestbuy</font>

68
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">but it's actually a cellphone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tower</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

69
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,380
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coverage in your home you</font>

70
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,630
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you live in a rural area or</font>

71
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,970
high-rise<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get one of these from</font>

72
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,790
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> cellphone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provider to increase your</font>

73
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,010
coverage in your home and they're pretty

74
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,230
cheap like we got ours for 250 dollars

75
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:23,040
in the carrier about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 bucks on ebay</font>

76
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:25,890
but they are little computers and they

77
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,090
can be broken into<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you break into</font>

78
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,920
a cell phone tower well you see

79
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,450
everything that goes across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell</font>

80
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone tower using phone calls text</font>

81
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:38,399
messages picture messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that stuff</font>

82
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:40,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">I your phone will automatically</font>

83
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,150
associate to them<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't</font>

84
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,900
have a ton of time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> prepare</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm</font>

85
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:49,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flip through some slides</font>

86
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:52,440
quickly so we focused on a femtocell<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

87
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:56,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">verizon this is a femtocell that came</font>

88
00:03:52,440 --> 00:04:00,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">out in 2010 and it does 3g so does data</font>

89
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:03,510
and what we did was we pulled phone

90
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,910
calls text messages<font color="#CCCCCC"> picture messages and</font>

91
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,640
we did active attacks on web surfing on

92
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:10,770
your phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you visited like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Wells</font>

93
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">Fargo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you we would get username and</font>

94
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,060
password and i'll show<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a video of</font>

95
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,620
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we also did some cloning which</font>

96
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

97
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,108
<font color="#E5E5E5">because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a ton of time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

98
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:26,669
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am going to talk about is how we</font>

99
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:29,520
look at the box how we broke into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

100
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:32,789
you can break into this type of box or

101
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:37,080
other embedded devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what you can</font>

102
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:39,810
do with it once you're on there so the

103
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,760
femtocell<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I said it's been for your</font>

104
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,590
home<font color="#CCCCCC"> you plug it into your internet</font>

105
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,590
connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it connects back to the</font>

106
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,570
cell phone carrier<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell phones will</font>

107
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,979
associate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it automatically so if you</font>

108
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,599
have like family come over for dinner or

109
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:53,039
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going to hop onto your</font>

110
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:54,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">come to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sell because you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

111
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:58,530
the strongest signal in that area

112
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,090
the device itself will connect back to

113
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,239
the carrier's network and that device is

114
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,070
encrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you look at the traffic</font>

115
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,900
that came out of the device because you

116
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,700
I mean you control your own home network

117
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can look at that traffic and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

118
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,830
encrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't really get anything</font>

119
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:16,770
out of it but if you're on the device

120
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's where the data is unencrypted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

121
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,469
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we want to go we want to</font>

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,080
break into the device so we can see the

123
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:27,419
unencrypted data we can actually listen

124
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:30,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to phone calls and stuff like that which</font>

125
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:33,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">is exactly what we did the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right hand</font>

126
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">model is the the newer femtocell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> left</font>

128
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,050
thing that you do when you want to do

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,909
any hardware hacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know if you</font>

130
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,400
guys have talked to Joe<font color="#E5E5E5"> grandi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">they're much more qualified than me but</font>

132
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll do my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

133
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,980
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do is take a</font>

134
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,500
look at the actual device

135
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:54,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and see what the heck it has so we</font>

136
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,430
look at this device and it's got power

137
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">jack it's got internet connection</font>

138
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gps antenna it's got the</font>

139
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,450
actual like cellular antenna<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it also</font>

140
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">had this little thing on the bottom and</font>

141
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,469
it's a little tricky to see in that

142
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,290
picture but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's under a rubber plug and</font>

143
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,580
it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> hdmi port that support that you</font>

144
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,560
have on your TV

145
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,219
so obviously this<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

146
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,370
doesn't do video<font color="#CCCCCC"> so why is there an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hdmi</font>

147
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,930
port<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we don't really know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

148
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,620
know is the person who makes these

149
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,560
things

150
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">samsung makes a whole lot of TVs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so they</font>

151
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:32,250
probably just had a whole bunch of

152
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:33,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">laying around in a box somewhere so it's</font>

153
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,570
obviously it's obviously not going to be

154
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:41,370
video<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what could it be</font>

155
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:43,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">well it's actually a serial port which</font>

156
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:46,050
means you can plug into it and you'll

157
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:48,630
get a text interface to the actual

158
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,580
computer that runs on this little box<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

159
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,650
if you've ever used like a command

160
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,380
prompt in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows or Linux that's what</font>

161
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">we got when we plugged into it but first</font>

162
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,130
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to actually figure out how to</font>

163
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,830
plug into it so we took an<font color="#E5E5E5"> hdmi cable we</font>

164
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,630
cut<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in half</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then we took a serial</font>

165
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,760
cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> for computer and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a nap</font>

166
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> display sit together</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we</font>

167
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:14,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">wrapped</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it up in a pen because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

168
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:17,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">not really good at soldering and this</font>

169
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:21,750
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this was the next step</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we've</font>

170
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:24,390
gotten a console access to the device<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

171
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,200
have like a login prompt<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we break</font>

172
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,940
into it

173
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,349
well the first thing that you can do is

174
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,030
you can just try guessing usernames and

175
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,070
passwords and that's a really great

176
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,299
thing to do because lots of times they

177
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,130
use default<font color="#E5E5E5"> user names and passwords</font>

178
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">like admin and admin or something like</font>

179
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,940
that

180
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:41,940
unfortunately for us that did not<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we</font>

181
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:44,430
had to find a couple of other ways in so

182
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,560
we have the cable<font color="#CCCCCC"> plugged in when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

183
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:49,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">started the device up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and what happened</font>

184
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,720
was it said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm gonna start up in</font>

185
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,520
like five seconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> say something if you</font>

186
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,710
want to change anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> more like why</font>

187
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,330
yes we do want to change something<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

188
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,890
hit that button and then it says well

189
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,289
what would you like to change<font color="#CCCCCC"> we said</font>

190
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,760
why don't you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> log</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us right in like</font>

191
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,150
don't give us the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> password</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

192
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">law</font>

193
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:11,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">just write in what's called single user</font>

194
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:14,039
mode and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> said so at that point</font>

195
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:17,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">wherein but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually got fixed in a</font>

196
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:19,080
patch from the carrier so we had to find

197
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,000
a new way in

198
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,260
so this time around you know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

199
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,880
like when<font color="#E5E5E5"> your computer freezes</font>

200
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,659
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hit ctrl Alt Delete on</font>

201
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">windows</font>

202
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">well we did the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> linux equivalent of that</font>

203
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,970
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux is another operating system if</font>

204
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,950
you haven't heard of it

205
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,510
we basically it was starting up and we

206
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,039
did what's called a magic<font color="#CCCCCC"> since</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rack</font>

207
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:39,659
which is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> control-alt-delete</font>

208
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:43,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it stopped everything including the</font>

209
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">the script that it ran to lock us out so</font>

210
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,740
that point we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can log right back in</font>

211
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:51,270
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like identifying the</font>

212
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,340
port and getting console access is

213
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,870
generally speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most important</font>

214
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:58,290
thing to do on hardware hacking once you

215
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:00,630
get to that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

216
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,719
won't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> say easy easy but it's</font>

217
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:06,180
easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> so once we got to that point</font>

218
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're pretty good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point we are</font>

219
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">route</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are system we have complete</font>

220
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,740
control over this little computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

221
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,160
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cellphone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tower</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's start seeing</font>

222
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,160
what we can do

223
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">so like I said it runs linux and</font>

224
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,300
generally speaking the first thing that

225
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:29,130
you do when you get a root access on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

226
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">linux</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> boxes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around and look for</font>

227
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:33,689
secrets

228
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,930
look for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> UH</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any passwords</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look for</font>

229
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:38,790
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard-coded encryption key stuff like</font>

230
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,819
that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we poked around the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> file system</font>

231
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:44,969
and we did find passwords and we found

232
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:48,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">ipsec</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keys and we found like lots of</font>

233
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,649
interesting stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> we also found a whole</font>

234
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:51,329
bunch of custom applications that

235
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:56,430
control it as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cellphone tower</font>

236
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:58,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously no documentation for those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

237
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:02,010
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point we need to kind of keep</font>

238
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,560
looking around but the console cable

239
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:07,529
wasn't working that great for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> for one</font>

240
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,018
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing if we ran any program and like</font>

241
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:11,430
hung like it didn't end right away<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

242
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,839
couldn't kill it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to pull out the</font>

243
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,550
power and restart the entire machine

244
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty annoying</font>

245
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,779
there was no text editor so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> couldn't</font>

246
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually edit any files about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what there</font>

247
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:25,019
was was a little utility called said<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

248
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:27,180
basically said let us edit some<font color="#E5E5E5"> piles it</font>

249
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,440
was kind of painful but it worked

250
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,790
it's one of those situations where you

251
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,889
just have to see what you have and find

252
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:35,430
a creative solution to the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

253
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:38,160
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point we could edit files and we</font>

254
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:41,010
could enable ssh<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is a remote</font>

255
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,079
console<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can log into the box</font>

256
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,420
without the console<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable and that</font>

257
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:47,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">worked quite well and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we got a nice</font>

258
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:53,579
environment for us to start poking

259
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:55,680
around and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing that we</font>

260
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:57,599
wanted to do was go look for the data

261
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,089
right we want to hear the phone calls

262
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">but when we looked at the data it was</font>

263
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:08,100
encrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to spot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow</font>

264
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:11,550
find the end the decrypted data and to

265
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:16,410
find the decrypted data<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had to write</font>

266
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:21,630
a whole bunch of code<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we ended up</font>

267
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:24,240
having to find the package that would

268
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,589
let us write programs for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> femtocells</font>

269
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,149
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't just like take a program</font>

270
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:28,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">from windows or program from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> linux</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

271
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:30,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">drop it on this computer and just run it</font>

272
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:33,740
you need to compile it and that requires

273
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's like annoying environment</font>

274
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:39,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was very frustrating to get up and</font>

275
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,880
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know if you throw enough</font>

276
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,190
time it's something you'll eventually

277
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">knock</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it over which we did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we could</font>

278
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:48,620
keep going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and run our own programs and</font>

279
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:52,610
at that point we could find the data

280
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:54,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">when it was decrypted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so at that point</font>

281
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:58,400
we can go after the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun stuff we can go</font>

282
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:59,780
after the voice<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the SMS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but the</font>

283
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,730
first thing that we did when we found

284
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,250
the decrypted data was that it was in

285
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:07,610
this weird format it made all these

286
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:09,020
little packets which you know that makes

287
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,950
sense it's a it's a phone call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will</font>

288
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:18,110
make lots of little stuff but we didn't

289
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:21,590
really know how to play it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in fact</font>

290
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:24,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">the specification said that this type of</font>

291
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:26,660
data means<font color="#E5E5E5"> do whatever you want and</font>

292
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:30,980
don't expect to play nicely with anybody

293
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:32,900
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we ended up spending a lot of</font>

294
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,370
time analyzing this data and looking at

295
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,650
like the sizes of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and trying to</font>

296
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,970
correlate it with something that made

297
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:41,180
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we didn't really and we</font>

298
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:45,830
eventually came up with an idea which

299
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:49,189
ended up working and at that point we

300
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:52,180
could listen to the actual data which i

301
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,180
will show you a video of

302
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:11,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fortunately</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no audio</font>

303
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oh</font>

304
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:22,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so doug is about to get a phone</font>

305
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,920
call on a phone that is associated to

306
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,120
the femtocell<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you probably won't be</font>

307
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,819
able to hear coming out of my little

308
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,460
laptop speakers<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in the bottom left</font>

309
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:33,550
you can see there's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fuzzy</font>

310
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:35,740
test text says<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like an incoming</font>

311
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,949
phone call<font color="#E5E5E5"> so he's going to answer that</font>

312
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,480
phone call<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is actually what is</font>

313
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,490
a program that we wrote on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> femtocell</font>

314
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tell us what's happening today he got</font>

315
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:48,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">a fact that you got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a phone call and he</font>

316
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,880
is talking on the phone and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in just a</font>

317
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,290
moment

318
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,620
he's going to hang up and we're going to

319
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:57,000
play back his phone call that we stole

320
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,000
off of the device

321
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we switch over to another computer</font>

322
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:11,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we pull the capture of the device</font>

323
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,810
and we run it through the decoding

324
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:25,570
program and what comes out is the actual

325
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:27,369
phone call<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have no idea that came out</font>

326
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,550
over the speakers but that is the phone

327
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,550
call

328
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:46,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we got phone calls but we also</font>

329
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:49,239
wanted to get text messages and that was

330
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:51,998
a similar process<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took a little bit to</font>

331
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:54,309
figure out how the text messages were

332
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:56,920
being sent across but once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

333
00:14:54,309 --> 00:15:02,259
kind of throw your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your time and hard</font>

334
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:04,029
work at it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> I come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

335
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:07,110
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> a video of that one also which does</font>

336
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,110
not have any sound

337
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">so in the lower right you can see that</font>

338
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're typing on a phone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then we can</font>

339
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,450
see a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> messages pop up on the</font>

340
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:32,390
screen those are the actual outgoing

341
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:35,060
text messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can see the text that</font>

342
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:37,520
they are sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Doug</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gets that</font>

343
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:42,229
message and he's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> reply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

344
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:43,460
very slowly so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you put that down</font>

345
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in a second</font>

346
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,320
the phone will receive the text message

347
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:51,470
and we will see it come<font color="#E5E5E5"> through right</font>

348
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,750
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> intercepting a text</font>

349
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,750
message and the response

350
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:05,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the next thing that we wanted to go</font>

351
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:07,390
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was actual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web browsing we</font>

352
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:13,810
wanted to go after like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> websites</font>

353
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:16,120
that you visit on your phone and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font>

354
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:23,709
example of data traffic is a picture

355
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:26,410
message so<font color="#E5E5E5"> dog is sending a picture</font>

356
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:29,350
message to another phone which we will

357
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,000
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> pop up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the lower</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> left-hand side</font>

358
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,250
will be like a little notification that

359
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,260
hey someone just sent you a picture

360
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,960
message<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there they are</font>

361
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:41,800
and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lower right we'll see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

362
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:43,720
the phone is slowly downloading it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

363
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:48,310
there it is it's a picture of a street

364
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,900
in manhattan and then we will switch

365
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:53,079
over to the other computer we will pull

366
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:58,530
the capture<font color="#CCCCCC"> like all the data off of the</font>

367
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,530
femtocell<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's image</font>

368
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:09,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the next thing that we wanted to do</font>

369
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:11,030
was modify the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> like all that is</font>

370
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,530
what's called passive attacks because

371
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,170
you're not actually doing anything to it

372
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:17,000
you're just looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> passive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we wanted</font>

373
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:19,520
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> active attacks we wanted to like</font>

374
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,900
actually modify the data make you see

375
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:26,180
something that someone didn't actually

376
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:29,300
send you and the easiest type of like

377
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:31,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">active attack is to delete it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">dropped</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the data on the floor so that</font>

379
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:36,680
people don't receive it and it just so

380
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,770
happens that there are some encrypted

381
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:42,950
messaging programs like<font color="#CCCCCC"> iMessage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if</font>

you if you use iMessage<font color="#E5E5E5"> the messages are</font>

383
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:49,100

387
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:01,640
your phone will retry<font color="#E5E5E5"> that message as a</font>

393
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:26,660
talk about the actual data itself let's

394

talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> web browsing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so when you</font>

browse something on the web that uses a

00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:36,200
protocol called<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP and normally this</font>

397
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:38,420
is fairly nice and it displays well in

398
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,050
wireshark it's easy to understand if you

399
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:45,980
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP but in this case that</font>

400
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:48,470
data was being encoded and split up in

401
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:51,110
very very frustrating ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry</font>

402
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:53,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find some other way to get</font>

403
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,790
the data out<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had to basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

404
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:58,970
a whole bunch of weird tricks and jump

405
00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:00,139
through a ton of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoops to get this data</font>

406
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:04,610
and you can see in the lower<font color="#E5E5E5"> right-hand</font>

407
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:06,590
corner is some<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP so our goal was to</font>

408
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:09,469
edit a<font color="#CCCCCC"> webpage know as simply as we</font>

409
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:13,520
could possibly do it but if you edit

410
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:14,300
anything in HTTP anything in the request

411
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,770
to the website

412
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to update a whole bunch of</font>

413
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:20,990
fields<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we had to update fields in the</font>

414
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,170
beginning we had update<font color="#CCCCCC"> fields in the</font>

415
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:26,540
end and unfortunately the packets might

416
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:30,080
be rearranged<font color="#E5E5E5"> and out of order</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font>

417
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:32,090
was kind of a real pain in the neck and

418
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">I have this whole long spiel about all</font>

419
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:40,280
the things that we tried and eventually

420
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:43,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we end up doing is the first step</font>

421
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:47,960
of opening a<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page is saying hey I</font>

422
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:52,130
want to talk to cnn.com<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google com</font>

423
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">where is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google.com and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll get a</font>

424
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,500
reply that says<font color="#CCCCCC"> google is at this</font>

425
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,950
address

426
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:00,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">kinda like looking in a phone book first</font>

427
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,930
we hijack that so we tell them

428
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:05,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over here at our server</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">not actually at the real server so we</font>

430
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:09,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">hijacked that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> request and give them a</font>

431
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:13,310
fake response<font color="#E5E5E5"> then when they try to talk</font>

to our server<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is google</font>

00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:20,240
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really us just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hijacking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:22,070

435
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,740
route around some some stuff that the

00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:27,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">cellphone network was doing our server</font>

437
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:31,130
gets it responds back and back in the

438
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:32,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">photo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we modified again to undo this</font>

stuff that we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning and</font>

440
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,410
then your phone will go and visit our

441
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:43,390
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking that it's google com and</font>

00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">i will show that video as well</font>

443
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:51,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">so in the lower</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right hand corner we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">wellsfargo.com the bank wells fargo in</font>

446
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,760
the lower left you can see that we're

447
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:03,120
loading the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are all of the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">requests that the phone is sending and</font>

449
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,678
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> wells fargo on lower right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

450
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,020
now we're going to click on sign in

451
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:16,530
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to type in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> username and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">password and in the upper left you will</font>

453
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:21,480
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> username and password</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pop right</font>

454
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:26,610
up and there it is

455
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:29,539
so this is a active hijacking of web

out completely and it's a little bit

concerning<font color="#E5E5E5"> when three of the four</font>

00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:12,168
releasing an application that will

detect femtocells<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put you into</font>

that we detect themselves as we say hey

489

the one that we worked with<font color="#CCCCCC"> can support</font>

doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> two cells and and we think</font>

00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:01,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">like we think it's a good thing yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

503

we don't really like<font color="#CCCCCC"> adults we think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

504
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:06,010
better idea would be if you could place

00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,809
calls on Wi-Fi<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you don't</font>

automatically join untrusted Wi-Fi

<font color="#E5E5E5">networks you have to actually say yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:13,030
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to join this Wi-Fi network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

509
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:15,600
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of gives you the option of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font>

510
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know</font>

511
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes so the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was about encryption</font>

512
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:41,570
on the phone into the carrier or all the

513
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,100
way to the other phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's two</font>

514
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">flavors of that one is called end-to-end</font>

515
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,309
encryption and that means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

516
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:47,990
encrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your phone and it's</font>

517
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:51,080
decrypted on the other person's phone

518
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:53,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's really awesome and extremely</font>

00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,490
secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> and extremely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deploy</font>

520
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,870
and there are apps that do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the</font>

521
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,639
other person have to ask to have the

00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,469
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps like red phone is an app that</font>

00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:02,870
does that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but both people have to be</font>

00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:05,630
using red phone the other flavor is

525
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,039
encryption from the phone into the

526
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,990
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> like carrier so it goes from</font>

527
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,908
phone all the way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> verizon and in that</font>

528
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,470
case the femtocell would only see

529
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:15,230
encrypted traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yes that would</font>

530
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:20,179
make it much more secure

531
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:26,690
well we're on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> femtocell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we would</font>

532
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:32,179
see it before it gets encrypted any

533
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:34,879
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> question how we figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hdmi</font>

534
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:37,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">cereal there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you have a circuit</font>

535
00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:39,980
board<font color="#E5E5E5"> there like can just attach leads</font>

536
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:43,129
to different parts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like see what it</font>

537
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,990
comes out<font color="#E5E5E5"> like see what type of how are</font>

538
00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:46,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting so it's like spiky that</font>

539
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,320
means like sending data<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's constant</font>

540
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:50,389
that means it's like a ground or

541
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,100
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Google then</font>

542
00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:58,070
some guy did it for us

543
00:25:52,100 --> 00:26:03,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

544
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:07,840
yeah we<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is any other</font>

545
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:07,840
questions otherwise i'll let<font color="#E5E5E5"> next yeah</font>

546
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:18,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">why would a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cell phone companies found</font>

547
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:19,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">ourselves instead of using their own</font>

548
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:21,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">tower</font>

549
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:23,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">i mean i-i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't work in a carrier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

550
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:26,399
can't really say<font color="#E5E5E5"> assertively or for</font>

551
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,989
certain but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean if you don't have</font>

552
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:29,758
coverage because you live out like

553
00:26:27,989 --> 00:26:31,889
you're like the only person in<font color="#CCCCCC"> an area</font>

554
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really expensive to install a</font>

555
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:36,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">cellphone tower</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like just for you</font>

556
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:38,309
so this is like 250<font color="#CCCCCC"> bucks I mean they</font>

557
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:39,779
could sell it to you or give it to you

558
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:48,210
and then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like well that</font>

559
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:50,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taken care of why don't they</font>

562
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">so that the range</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a femtocell is</font>

563
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,439
relatively small like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> official</font>

around<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that way you know if you have</font>

567
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,160

yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and also you can build a</font>

569
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,580
Faraday cage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't</font>

573
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:36,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">sprint verizon AT&T couple hundred bucks</font>

574
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there are a whole bunch of resources</font>

575
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:41,300
on embedded device hacking and that type

576
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,800
of stuff so it's definitely within

577
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,310
people's reached like start poking

578
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,310
around with

579
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,120
however hard would it be to make your

580
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,130
own<font color="#CCCCCC"> photo cell using like a</font>

581

<font color="#CCCCCC">um not so the nice attractive thing</font>

584
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,970
about the femtocell is it automatically

585
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,710
remotes into like<font color="#E5E5E5"> verizon's network and</font>

586
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:14,690
passes all the traffic so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

587
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:16,280
where you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

588
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,320
because you call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it rise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you say hey</font>
