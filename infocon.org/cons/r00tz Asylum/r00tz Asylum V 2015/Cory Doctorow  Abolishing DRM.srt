1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,819
so I'm gonna talk today I found it
information security and how it works

2
00:00:07,819 --> 00:00:13,509
and where comes from and where it's
going and I have talked a really long

3
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:18,390
you on information security so does
anyone here know what I mean when I say

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,410
alchemy alchemy was alright so for those
of you who don't know what alchemy was

5
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,369
before we had science we had a thing
that looked a lot like science call out

6
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:34,000
and tried to turn left into go right and
they did what they do to turn 1100 they

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,280
made up the things in the world they saw
things happening and they said maybe

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,850
this is causing that how can I check to
see if the design and expense right and

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,260
then they would have run the experiment
to see whether accident causing lie

10
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,890
where they can learn more about the
world would help in this project to turn

11
00:00:51,890 --> 00:01:00,629
my goal but they kept everything that
they learned the secret and human being

12
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,289
common frailty right we all about this
one thing in common which is that we're

13
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,330
really gonna kidding ourselves have you
ever got into an argument with someone

14
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,710
like maybe your photos and we are sure
that you're right you're a hundred

15
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,399
percent sure that you're right and then
afterwards you turn around you see

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,659
something written down or picture are
you looking your email you realize

17
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:26,960
you're totally wrong that you're
bringing it been lying to you about what

18
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,210
you remember what you thought it
happened right human beings are really

19
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,149
really terrible and knowing what's going
on in the world we're really gonna

20
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,110
kidding ourselves and what that met with
the alchemist should kid themselves

21
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,240
about whether or not their parents
turned out the way they thought they

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,839
would so this would say I think this
causes that and then they would one day

23
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:53,320
when they look at the results and they
go bowling right out of public life and

24
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,039
they would ignore the parts

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,180
hypothesis and they really make a big
deal on the part of the people the right

26
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,220
to alchemy didn't go anywhere that baby
name for the five hundred-year period

27
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,030
during which we had all sciences anyone
know what that period was called

28
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:20,920
now what their policy is exactly why so
I never figured out how to turn it in to

29
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,420
go but they figured out how to turn down
the superstition and human frailty into

30
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,380
something even more valuable than gold

31
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,910
welcome this started to do after five
interviews that it wrong they started to

32
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,910
publish their results they started to
tell other people what they thought

33
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,540
they'd learned and what that kid with an
expose them to something called

34
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:46,160
adversarial here with you people who
don't like you here is people who work

35
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,600
in the same stuff as you and with you
mean that they had tension to the set

36
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,600
that you've done and tell you anything
about yesterday nothing so we hope you

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,549
review means that your friends

38
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,900
point out that you've made in your
enemies tell you what you were doing

39
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,459
made them and without mercy reappearing
you can be became something else would

40
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:14,420
know how he became with a sort of
publishing and you know we call that

41
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,649
moment the Enlightenment right so we got
the invite right that's how we got

42
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:27,510
that's how we got science as we know it
today we let other people see what we

43
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,310
thought we knew we let them tell us what
an idiot we were to have made the dumb

44
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,260
mistakes that we made we correct those
mistakes and we've found records after

45
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,280
Rick that we could use to build up the
entire edifice of Science and everything

46
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,960
we know about the world today

47
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:50,260
so couldn't honesty which is the
cornerstone of contemporary security and

48
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,310
cryptography we talked about there being
three people who are a lot in this

49
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,910
internal trying a little lovin rivalry

50
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,520
Paul and Carol there like a love song
stylist Bob and Carol on YouTube that

51
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,480
you can look up and the way that it was
Allison barber friends brother and they

52
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,109
want to share information with each
other and carol is evil and Carol wants

53
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:17,690
to know what Alice involved saying to
each other and they want to know and

54
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,620
maybe she wants to change what they're
saying to each other so that you can

55
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,460
track them and so Alice and Bob used
coats the use of cryptography and you

56
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,940
got workshops hear about photography and
there's lots of talk refers to me at

57
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,400
this conference you can tell you all
about puerto they use put out these

58
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,000
photos to share messages with one
another and when they use this crypto

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,820
they make to really important
assumptions the first one is that they

60
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,150
assume that Carol can get a copy of the
message after they scrambled and they

61
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:52,020
make that assumption because these days
we send our messages through media that

62
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,380
anyone can see right looks amazing send
it over a radio wave like with wifi so

63
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,770
anyone who's a range of the wifi they
can get all the packets they can see all

64
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,159
the messages and they can think and look
at what carolyn Allison barber sending

65
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,850
to each other or maybe they use
satellite communications right

66
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,880
satellite-based internet so its
satellites it's up there in

67
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,440
geosynchronous orbit and it being down
the school of radio energy that blanket

68
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,510
the whole so careless like anywhere on
the continent that I losses on you can

69
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,219
see the message that both sent Alice or
maybe they just turned it over the

70
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,090
internet right so maybe they hop on the
internet here and they pull up their

71
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,289
phone and they they send a message and
it goes over the wifi and then there's

72
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,960
like the person at the hotel who runs
the WiFi network that person could be

73
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,090
Carol or working with Carol or then it
jumps onto the backbone of the internet

74
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:41,979
service provider

75
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:48,910
up to them maybe someone working to no
service provider or Internet service

76
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,850
provider may be somewhere between there
is working for carol is there a lot of

77
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,820
people who could be Caro who can get a
copy the message to Alice and Bob need

78
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,640
to assume that Carol can get the message
that their system only works when Carol

79
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,120
can get a copy the message it won't work
most of the time and only work when

80
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,460
they're actually like they can hand each
other messages in which case they could

81
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,599
just whispered only codes right so
that's the first thing that they assume

82
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,080
the second thing that they assume is
that Carol know it was how they scramble

83
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,530
the message Carol knows what they did to
keep the message I think what code they

84
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:24,750
use so this is a bit we're right why
would they assume the Carol knows what

85
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:31,420
could they use why would they try to
keep their code a secret from Carol well

86
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,090
because we only have one way to find out
whether or not to come as any good peer

87
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,940
review right you have to let strangers
who don't like you see what you've done

88
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,130
to make your message secret in order to
find out whether or not you make

89
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:50,380
mistakes because otherwise only people
who are your friends get to see it all

90
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,210
you got to see it you will list
demonstrates that you've made 20 of the

91
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,030
same side and no one has an interest in
pointing out your mistakes that it's

92
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,210
only people who were in the same
companies you get to see the way that

93
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,760
you made the code or only people in the
same university department as you only

94
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,190
people who like are your family you get
to see the way that you made up this all

95
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:13,219
those people want you to succeed and so
their brains will lie to them about

96
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,670
whether or not their mistakes in their
brains won't find the flaws that their

97
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:21,020
enemies both fine and so they assume
that counsel knows what they've done to

98
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:26,289
scramble the code but there's one thing
that carol does not know this is why

99
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:31,170
Alice and Bob were able to communicate
and perfect secrecy Carol doesn't know

100
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:39,550
what you having for the message you have
the cypher and you have the keys right

101
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:45,600
so the keys are a thing that you combine
with the code to scramble Indies

102
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,040
message and so long as you don't have
the keys if the current worth you can

103
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,890
never be able to message when I think
never i mean never write your own pocket

104
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:01,030
distraction rectangle can scramble of
message so thoroughly that if we took

105
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:06,070
every hydrogen atom in the entire
universe and turn it into a computer and

106
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,030
every one of those computers doing
nothing but trying to get keys between

107
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:14,619
now and the moment billions of years in
the future when the universe runs out of

108
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,640
energy and cools down and no more can be
done

109
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,330
you would have run out of universe
before you ran into keys so so long as

110
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,940
Alice and Bob keep their Brett Carroll
never read the message even though she

111
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:33,169
knows how they scrambled it and even
though she they know they know what the

112
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,939
messages so this is an amazing thing
this is actually a new thing on the face

113
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,970
of the earth we have never had the power
to keep messages this this

114
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:46,810
secrets this well as long as you trust
the person on the other side so long as

115
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,829
that person doesn't have someone break
into their house instead hidden webcam

116
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,640
over their computer screens they can
read the message when they met you and

117
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,180
that person can communicate and perfect
secrecy and we even have all kinds of

118
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,329
cool ways of sharing those keys over the
internet without letting third-party see

119
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:06,370
them if you want to google that people
dual key cryptography and you can see

120
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,830
how we shared keys it's a it's a pretty
amazing I'm not not going to get into it

121
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,070
today that would take the rest of the
talk but it's clever and its cool

122
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:18,080
alright so that's how that's how to
guarantee works today but where is it

123
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,870
going well it's not going well I have to
say and it's not going well because of

124
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:31,830
something really weird dumb mistake that
politicians made in 1996 1996 the

125
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:36,230
internet was picking off people were
starting to get interested in using the

126
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,830
internet to talk to people for reasons
other than technical reasons you know

127
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,910
the early internet was all scientists
talking to each other and military

128
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,900
contractors talking to each other they
are now starting to talk to each other

129
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,030
about other stuff

130
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:51,360
about what movies they like and whether
they were gonna go out for hamburgers on

131
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,480
Friday and the people who made music and
the people who made movies that people

132
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,220
in a video games and books they are
there to worry that anything that will

133
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:07,100
become a way to share without paying for
it and they also started to get very

134
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:12,500
hopeful that maybe they could use
cryptography to instead of charging

135
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,370
people once for accessing their words
right instead of selling you a book or

136
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:21,730
selling a movie that maybe they can just
tell you like one fragment of the movie

137
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,900
right the right to watch the movie wants
the right to read the book but only when

138
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,329
you're in Las Vegas and not when you're
somewhere else so maybe they can sell

139
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:34,330
you a tour guide to New York that you
could that you had to pay for if you're

140
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:38,240
in New York was free you somewhere else
so you can you can pick it up at home in

141
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,260
minnesota you could read and this will
be really useful when I get to New York

142
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,900
but when you've got to New York you have
to pay to use it and they saw a gold

143
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,240
mine and they thought what we're going
to do is figure out how to use

144
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,570
cryptography so that we can lock people
out of the computers that they own and

145
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,480
that they use every day right now with
their plans they came up with this new

146
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,070
crypto model or instead of having
Allison Bobby Harrell you just have

147
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,010
Allison ball

148
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,990
thinking that blacks could be met flex

149
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,150
want to send you a movie and he wants to
make sure that you couldn't watch that

150
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,410
movie but he wants to make sure that you
can't save that movie and watch it again

151
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,230
later so you can just download all your
favorite Netflix movies cancel your

152
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,420
subscription and come back to it and and
then just watch those movies for as long

153
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,910
as you want but has weird ideas about
how people watch movies he thinks people

154
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,980
only have like 1111 movies are a hundred
babies that they like once they got

155
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,430
those they don't describe anymore but
the ball in the world sometimes have

156
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,609
weird ideas so Bob wants to make sure
that you can that he can send you the

157
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:46,450
movie but you can only watch the movie
on the terms that he that he set and so

158
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,600
far gives you a piece of software for
decrypting the move

159
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,819
scramble the movie so no one in the
world of us they have the keys then

160
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:59,490
gives you a piece of software that has
the keys but that piece of software

161
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:05,709
doesn't have a Save button and so you
can save them right so it's not by Carol

162
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:13,910
just bought a house sends out the
message gives Alice the keys bob hope

163
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,959
that Alice never figures out where he
hid those keys right this doesn't work

164
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:26,339
does because Alice can be anyone in the
world can be anyone who goes out and

165
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:32,959
buys a Netflix subscription that person
can can then look very hard at the

166
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,420
Netflix client for Netflix software and
figure out just where bob hit the keys

167
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,910
and this is why every time we make one
of these digital lock systems it's

168
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,569
usually broken in like a day often by a
teenager with nothing better to do right

169
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:52,630
now because the people who make it are
done but because the idea of hiring keys

170
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:57,920
and something that you give to your
enemy is done and you know you think

171
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,860
about it like you a bank manager you had
a really cracking good safe no matter

172
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,810
how good that safe was you wouldn't
leave it in the bank robbers living room

173
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:12,209
right because you understand that the
bank robber 168 is in her living room

174
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:17,869
she can subjected to torment that
everything will eventually yield to

175
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:23,050
write it so in the case of Netflix
involved in Dallas I was might be like a

176
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,880
poor grad student who's got a bunch of
undergraduates are clever get into

177
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,240
trouble when they're left on their own

178
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,089
own as you want to give them a task and
no one in the lab with the electron

179
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:37,370
tunneling microscope this weekend and so
has access to a lot of pretty badass

180
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:43,260
equipment that you can use to figure out
where bob get the keys that 1996 a

181
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,720
United Nations specialized agency called
the World Intellectual Property

182
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,029
Organization WIPO

183
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:53,170
because I am sooo from iran but you can
remember wipe out there with all the

184
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,290
world's dumbest copyright laws come from
there like the same relationship to dump

185
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,699
copyright that bored or has the evil in
middle or write it all comes from the

186
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:07,410
Crack of Doom engine right so why powell
came up with this treaty the white low

187
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,050
copyright for you the WCET and what that
treaty 7 that the countries that signed

188
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,490
that would have to pass a law that made
it illegal

189
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:21,580
really illegal to extract he's from
programs that had keys hidden in them or

190
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:26,420
telling people how to extract from those
programs or to tell them information

191
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:31,050
that they could use to figure out how to
get the keys and in 1998 America

192
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:36,699
pathological the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act DMCA and you may know the

193
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,560
DMCA because that's what all of your
made all your favorite videos on YouTube

194
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,180
you know whenever you want to see a
video on youtube video removed because

195
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:50,279
of a claim under the DMCA that DMCA
right so the DMCA

196
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:56,829
this action section 1201 in section 1201
said that if you help people find keys

197
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:01,180
in program that I control access to
copyrighted worse that firm first

198
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:06,750
offense you can go to jail for five
years and you can pay a $5,000 fine it

199
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,350
hasn't happened very often that they put
in jail just want to be true sculley off

200
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:18,089
to show that Adobe's ebook Digital ops
didn't work they put him in jail he

201
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:23,540
actually presented at this conference
2000 and to set up on the stage down at

202
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,110
the Rio Hotel which is where the
conference used to be

203
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,259
gave a presentation about a vote and
then the FBI lot of weight

204
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:36,229
handcuffs for showing people how to read
books the wrong so that's a pretty clear

205
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:39,949
message to a lot of programmers and
those programmers

206
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:45,699
looking or when they looked they stopped
talking about what they found in things

207
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:49,569
that had digital locks on them because
nobody wants to go to jail for five

208
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:55,108
years for helping people watch movies
the wrong way so they operated in secret

209
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:57,919
of the operator that all you maintain a
perennial 10 program called handbrake

210
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:03,539
never use Handbrake handbrake rips DVDs
for you in the programmers in May that

211
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:07,689
are anonymously hide out I don't tell
anyone who they are because nobody wants

212
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:13,059
to go to jail for helping people with
their DVDs so that was back in a

213
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:18,019
company's engineer all kinds of crazy
ripoffs over the years that followed

214
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:24,339
right so if you have a computer that has
a CD and DVD Drive and you put a CD in

215
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:29,699
debt that CD will wait up software that
the manufacturer's supplied with your

216
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:34,008
computer that will say would you like to
convert the music on the CDC can take it

217
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:38,129
with you on your distracting rectangle
or stream into something else or use it

218
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:43,309
as background music in your school
projects or make it into a ringtone or

219
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:48,019
alarm tone all that stuff just happens
right there's no digital clock on the CD

220
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:52,470
and so members could write that software
that lets you do all that legal stuff

221
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:57,189
with the music on your CD more value
that came out of your CD if you take a

222
00:16:57,189 --> 00:17:02,099
DVD and you stick it in your DVD Drive
and your CD DVD Drive all your computer

223
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,399
will let you do with it is the same
thing you can do with it in 1996 and

224
00:17:05,398 --> 00:17:10,589
DVDs hit the market which is watching
tonight since 1996 no one new feature

225
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:15,168
has been added to the DVD if you want to
watch a DVD on your phone you can do

226
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:18,339
what you do with your music the disc and
have a music automatically go to your

227
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:25,648
phone if you want to set up by the DVD
movie through the iTunes Store through

228
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:32,219
the Amazon store through the Google
story wasn't good

229
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,179
I was bad enough as it as a kind of took
too long but a funny thing happened on

230
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:41,230
the way to the future which is that the
world became a world leaders say that

231
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,210
these days a car

232
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:47,559
the most important thing about that car
is not the transmission and it's not the

233
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:53,158
end it's not the ignition system it's
the computer in the car so one of the

234
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:55,309
presenters at this year's DEFCON

235
00:17:55,309 --> 00:18:01,928
showed that they could have done take a
Jeep Cherokee and over the Internet

236
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:06,360
seized control of the Jeep Cherokees
computers and take over the ceiling in

237
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:12,299
the breaks the most important fact about
that G is not the tires it's the

238
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:16,730
computer that keep is a computer that
you put your body inside of that then

239
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,809
drive had a hundred miles an hour down
the highway with you trapped inside of

240
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:23,559
it and depending on whether or not you
can trust that computer you're either

241
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:26,850
gonna get where you're going or
something terrible is going to happen to

242
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:32,340
this building is a computer that we put
our bodies inside because modern

243
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,070
buildings are built with such a high
specification of insulation because

244
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,879
that's the only way you can run air
conditioning in a cost effective way and

245
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:47,470
you know places like Las Vegas that the
computers are shut down that control the

246
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,870
climate control this building at those
computers are shut down the building

247
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,080
would become uninhabitable almost
immediately and because of the way the

248
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,720
building like this trap humidity if you
love the computers offer any length of

249
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,860
time the building will start filling up
with black mold and before long the only

250
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,990
thing you could do with that to record
habitable again is not get down to the

251
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:10,400
foundation slab and build a new one this
building a computer that you live inside

252
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,070
of but it's not just a bit cheaper
bodies inside of computers these days I

253
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,200
travel all the time and the first rule
of the heavy travelers always be

254
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,980
charging ABC so wherever I go

255
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,419
like many of you the first thing I do
when I get in her room as I stand base

256
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:26,850
boards for plugs

257
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,820
I was looking for somewhere to plug my
laptop and one day I was sitting in an

258
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,149
airport lounge in feeling super smug
dichotomy only working plug in this

259
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,690
airport lounge charging up before a long
flight is to live in Europe so that all

260
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:44,610
these long flights and a guy walked up
to me and you know going to do not like

261
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:50,408
a guy dressed like I am and he said what
I thought was a very sneaky way to

262
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:55,220
modify you that plug so you know I
looked at me for my glasses and i said

263
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:02,399
im charging my laptop before the flight
he said he rolled up his pants leg and

264
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:07,489
his leg was off at the knees and below
the knee he had a robotic prostheses on

265
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:14,090
and he said I need my life before the
flight and I said the plug is all yours

266
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:20,580
right so we increasingly have computers
integrated into our bodies a researcher

267
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,799
who died two years ago by heavy jack
gave a demo in Australia of his ability

268
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,309
to remotely take control of implanted
defibrillators

269
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:32,580
computers connected to batteries that
live inside of your chest cavity

270
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,620
interconnected directly to your heart
and there for people whose heart stopped

271
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,209
beating because of their heart
conditions and it would shock you back

272
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,530
into life right he's seen that's on the
movies when someone has a heart attack

273
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:48,539
they rub the paddle together man to life
this doesn't automatically it sits in

274
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:52,610
your chest and doctors what they want to
get telemetry off they want to know what

275
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,658
it's doing what it's detecting about
your higher and they want to be able to

276
00:20:55,659 --> 00:21:00,210
reprogram it if they have new features
that they find bugs and so these doctors

277
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,789
they use the wireless interface to
connect to it because it's hard to

278
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:08,549
connect a USB cable to something inside
your chest cavity right you don't go out

279
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:13,929
and party judge that over the wireless
interface he could administer lethal

280
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:17,659
shock to people with implanted
defibrillators in fact he showed one

281
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:21,860
better he showed that he could install a
wireless virus on people's implanted

282
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,219
defibrillators and they won't stand
constantly for other implanted

283
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,010
defibrillators and when they found the
like if you went to the hospital tenure

284
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:32,049
defibrillators service anywhere in the
world where all the other people the

285
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:32,990
defibrillator what

286
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,380
where it would reprogram a little bit
defibrillators to seek other

287
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:40,070
defibrillators every program that and
then it sometime in the future

288
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:44,960
every one of them in their shoes where
they stood dead as doornail else right

289
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,550
now there's a thing about a woman out of
computers combined with a world where

290
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:56,840
the government says if you put a lock on
something we will use taxpayers money to

291
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,120
stop people from breaking out law and
what that is is an attractive nuisance

292
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:08,229
law hauser an invitation to mister
because if you tell a company that if

293
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,800
you make a device that has an add-on
like a printer with a printer cartridge

294
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:19,740
or an iPhone with the charger cable or
Nast digital thermostat can run out and

295
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:26,950
you put jobs in da best easy to break
digital law that we will see on your

296
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:32,050
behalf we will prosecute any of your
competitors who removes that law to give

297
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:36,629
your customers more value so that you
could always charge as much as you want

298
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:44,590
for spare tires or income or then
companies are doing it and every one of

299
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,050
these categories now has digital locks
on them and so every one of these

300
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:51,340
categories is now something where
programmers who discovered

301
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,760
vulnerabilities you discover mistakes
the programmers have made no longer can

302
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,620
report that and that brings us back to
alchemy because if you're not allowed to

303
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,139
talk about what you've done what you
found it there's no adversarial peer

304
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,340
review that bob's will learn in our
devices now every three years

305
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,309
the USS Copyright Office hold hearings
or whether they should grant exceptions

306
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:18,590
to this 1201 law that EMC at 12:01 which
they asked are there any ways in which

307
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:22,309
this is interfering with things that
would be in the public good and this

308
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:25,710
year they have these hearings and
they've heard some stuff that will make

309
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:30,030
the hair on the back of your neck stand
up so one of the researchers who filed a

310
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:36,879
comment he has diabetes type 1 diabetes
and if you have diabetes you need to

311
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,550
take insulin 2013 blood sugar and the
way that we did this before we had small

312
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,290
cheap computers is a human being

313
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,050
usually the person with diabetes would
take some blood and they would measure

314
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:52,270
what their blood sugar was and then they
would go and they calculate how much

315
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,040
insulin they needed to they draw that
much into a needle in a haystack

316
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,840
themselves with a needle and that's been
a lab tech in human beings are really

317
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,540
crappy live text computers are awesome
lab tests and so what happened is over

318
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,950
the years you make little mistakes one
little mistake another little mistake

319
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:12,610
you be too busy you let it go and over
the years you sure your life take five

320
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:17,189
ten years off your life now this
researcher who filed in in the 12 when

321
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:21,630
hearing he said I want an implanted
defibrillator but I don't have one as I

322
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:26,400
get the code on those implanted
defibrillators you'd be crazy to stick

323
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,590
one of those computers inside your body
but I can't tell you why because they

324
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:35,780
used internal ought to make sure that
doctors have to buy their software to

325
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:41,678
get analytics off of those implanted
insulin pumps and in order to protect

326
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,200
that profit margin they put a lock on it
and if I remove the law or tell you

327
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,460
about the mistakes they've made that you
could use to remove the lock and I

328
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,570
commit a felony and so all around
america others diabetics walking around

329
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:58,030
with these wirelessly capable implanted
insulin pumps that can kill them in

330
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,990
their boots and one of them just
implanted medical devices

331
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,029
there's a farmer who filed

332
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:08,909
he said I have a John Deere tractor you
know there's big green tractors and one

333
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:14,999
day my real sensor went out my tractor
wouldn't go and so I called up to join

334
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:18,749
your company and I said my character
ongoing they said yeah there's a sensor

335
00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:21,940
that such as whether your wheels have
been off the air pressure you're tired

336
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:29,989
enough air pressure and it's it's it's
getting a bad reading will ship within 2

337
00:25:29,989 --> 00:25:35,210
days ago but I want to plan my field now
can I just turn this off they said no we

338
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:39,169
can't give you the key software keys you
would need to get access to software in

339
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:45,649
your tractor the train secret so he was
petitioning to allow himself to

340
00:25:45,649 --> 00:25:52,619
jailbreak his tractor and John Deere
doesn't really care if you change the

341
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:57,339
sensor out on your own your wheel
yourself or suppress it out but John

342
00:25:57,339 --> 00:25:58,339
Deere has these things

343
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:02,269
torque sensors that are on the wheels
and they sense how hard that we all have

344
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:07,940
to step in as it moves around the
farmers fields they conduct centimeter

345
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:13,570
accurate survey of the soil density of
farmers fields across america but they

346
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:19,109
don't tell the farmers how their fields
before they tell seed companies how

347
00:26:19,109 --> 00:26:22,908
their their their fields perform and
then if you want to know what you have

348
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:26,710
to buy seeds from those see companies
and so they want to make it illegal to

349
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,129
jailbreak your tractor and they filed
comments with the Copyright Office and

350
00:26:30,129 --> 00:26:35,478
said no tractor jailbreaking and NGF who
make cars they'd all the comment in

351
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:40,859
support of John Deere and they said you
shouldn't be allowed to jailbreak your

352
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:43,199
car either why not

353
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,580
well because they want to make sure that
mechanics can only fix your cars after

354
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:52,080
they sign a contract that says I'm only
gonna buy parts from GM's and so the GMP

355
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,689
get as much money as possible for the
part they put in your cars so these

356
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:03,259
companies they do not doing this because
they want to make the security of your

357
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:07,399
devices weaker they're doing it because
they want to make more money but thats

358
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:08,139
side effects

359
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:12,880
act of making it a felony to tell you
about flaws in your devices that it

360
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,070
makes it impossible for you to know
whether or not a device's something you

361
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:24,110
can trust and short-circuit the process
that separates alchemy from science so

362
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:28,050
it's a terrible state of affairs now I
work for an organization called the

363
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:31,820
Electronic Frontier Foundation that one
of the sponsors you can see them on some

364
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,040
of the banners and there is a band
around here somewhere that logo on it

365
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:41,620
and yet there were some of the good guys
and the internet we help defend people's

366
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,280
rights on the internet and we've
launched a ten year project to end this

367
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,570
law and to end all digital arts within a
decade that's our big project it's what

368
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:55,129
I'm that's what I'm doing for the next
decade and I'm not going to talk about

369
00:27:55,130 --> 00:28:00,060
it in detail but there's not much to say
except that why we're doing it so I hope

370
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:03,129
you come out interesting and I'm happy
to take any questions and comments time

371
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:06,650
do every other time take a couple of
questions so we could alternate baby

372
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:17,800
girls and boys and girls who like to ask
the first question yeah doesn't create a

373
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,060
monopoly it does create a monopoly
that's a great question

374
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:26,280
yeah i dont monopolies illegal no but
police are not illegal they're subject

375
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,879
to strict scrutiny which means that the
government generally things monopolies

376
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,280
are about idea and if you can show the
monopolies doing something that's

377
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,250
against the public interest they will
they will intervene

378
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:41,070
monopolies aren't strictly illegal and
the thing about copyright is it supposed

379
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:45,600
to be a monopoly right I'm supposed to
be the only person who can authorize

380
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,110
other people to copy my both in fact
before yet the term intellectual

381
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:53,719
property property we used to use the
term authors monopoly to describe the

382
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,960
offers in relationship to copyright and
so this is this funny thing where this

383
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:04,690
thing was mostly harmless sometimes a
bit weary kind of horror of the law has

384
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,779
suddenly become the single most
important factor Bolivar legal systems

385
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:14,590
I'm gonna stick with kids for now if
there's no kids with with their hands of

386
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:24,099
a column yes where the farmers told
about the centers of their tractor you

387
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:29,269
for another excellent question I think
maybe I think that there's probably you

388
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:33,450
know if you've ever liked gone to a
website before you can use it you have

389
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,419
to click this agreement that's like
seven hundred pages long you never read

390
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:40,940
it because whenever you read it says
stuff like by being dumb enough to use

391
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,029
this service you agree not like we're
allowed to come over to your house and

392
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:46,839
where your underwear and make long
distance calls and punch your

393
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:51,299
grandmother and get all the food in your
fridge you know like like they probably

394
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:56,039
says it somewhere but you know there's a
lot of stuff that you can't even if you

395
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:59,789
give people know it does in law we do
that this year that notice isn't enough

396
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:05,469
for some kinds of some kinds of
arrangements right like so if I put a

397
00:30:05,469 --> 00:30:09,849
sign up over the door of my book store
that said you ought to come into my

398
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:14,399
boxer but if I like you I can murder you
it doesn't mean that I get to murder you

399
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:19,619
write and say there's something some
rights that we expect people that they

400
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:23,459
can contract out and then there's some
other rights that people have that they

401
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:29,659
can contract out of but only thing that
will keep the contract so many I can

402
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:31,879
negotiate with you

403
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:38,149
the terms on which you know like if you
were gonna get married to my kid right

404
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:42,070
maybe the two of you can negotiate your
prenuptial agreement that said like by

405
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:45,629
getting married you agree that like this
is my grandmother's wedding ring and

406
00:30:45,629 --> 00:30:49,379
it's not gonna go to you if we get a
divorce or whatever right but we

407
00:30:49,379 --> 00:30:53,918
probably can't do is just have like a
long letter that says by marrying me

408
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,570
you're reading the following negotiable
right that there's a difference in wall

409
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:05,589
between turns that can be that have to
be negotiated on terms that any other

410
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:12,200
kids with questions Posey why why why
that different

411
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,570
well because a lot of the times we
assume that people who negotiated

412
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,429
actually

413
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:23,320
to talk back that they don't think the
whole issue through and then maybe

414
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,300
they'll get up and walk away from the
table but usually those contracts worth

415
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,980
you just have to click through to to to
agree to those contracts are usually

416
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,270
just sort of crammed down people's
throats they don't have a lot of choices

417
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,350
like you've already bought your plane
ticket and you show up at the airport

418
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,050
and on the back your ticket this is the
bunch of junk about the things you can

419
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:44,250
sue the airline over kinda too late you
want there's a difference between

420
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,680
negotiation of unequal and things that
are just crammed down people's throats

421
00:31:47,680 --> 00:32:09,890
by big businesses yeah

422
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:20,880
the armory and demanded you know there
are some real problems with the

423
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,690
legislative process in america and in
other countries in the world and they've

424
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,700
gotten worse over the last twenty years

425
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:33,290
policy outcomes legal I pounds from law
making processes have become more and

426
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:36,730
more favorable to a smaller and smaller
group of richer and richer people and

427
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:42,390
companies I group at princeton that did
a study of 20,000 us' legislative and

428
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:45,860
policy outcomes over the last twenty
years and found that in every case where

429
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:49,030
there is a conflict between the public
interest and the interest of the 10%

430
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:53,720
richest people in America went to the
richest people in America and so that is

431
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,410
a genuine probably legislative process
and the companies that do this they make

432
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,690
a lot of money from doing it and that's
one of the reasons that these laws have

433
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:05,100
remained intact for as long as they have
a real problem but in america there's

434
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,810
something that other countries don't
have which is a strong constitution and

435
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:16,110
an independent judiciary that means that
judges can invalidate laws by asking

436
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:19,439
themselves whether or not the laws are
consistent with the USS Constitution and

437
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,470
the Bill of Rights and so normally if
you want to reform the law and in

438
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,960
countries that don't have strong
constitutional traditions or in

439
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,430
countries that don't have independent
judiciary's you have to convince a

440
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:33,510
majority of lawmakers to vote against
that bad law in favor of a bit of a

441
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:39,190
better one but in the case of America
sometimes you can just get one judge or

442
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:43,210
three judges or the case the Supreme
Court five judges to agree with you you

443
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:47,350
can make outlaws go away so the early
nineteen nineties it was illegal for

444
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:52,260
civilians to use cryptography only the
military was allowed to use cryptography

445
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:57,420
and the NSA band civilian access to
crypto and we made all kinds of

446
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:02,010
arguments about why this was a terrible
idea right like they said oh well

447
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:07,490
civilians can use this script out called
s50 and that'll be strong enough like

448
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:12,340
bank robbers and the Mafia and spies
they will be able to break it but we can

449
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,890
if we need to to like see what the bad
guys are doing right like a criminal

450
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:19,540
uses that will always be able to gain
access to it and we made arguments why

451
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,330
why does he was proud guy named John
Gilmore is one of the founders of the

452
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:27,580
eff he built a computer from scratch to
break does it cost them a

453
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:31,879
quarter-million dollars and it gets all
the keys within two hours he said the

454
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:35,710
whole American banking system can be
defeated in two hours per quarter

455
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:40,480
million dollars under the proposed are
making and nobody in Washington area but

456
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,360
then we found a programmer named Daniel
paper and study at the University of

457
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,840
California Berkeley and and Dan was
publishing strong crypto on the internet

458
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,169
source code for it and we argued that he
had the First Amendment free-speech

459
00:34:55,168 --> 00:34:59,980
right to publish source code that code
was a form of speech protected under the

460
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:06,270
First Amendment and 9th circuit judge in
California agree and then the NSA AP lit

461
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,780
and it went to the Appellate Division of
the 9th circuit and a majority of the

462
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,460
9th circuit appellate division agreed
and that was the end of the crypto bad

463
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:18,210
we didn't have to convince one lawmaker
that they were wrong all we need to do

464
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,810
is convince a judge that it was
unconstitutional and that's why I think

465
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:25,400
we can make a change here so if you look
like you've got your separate script

466
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,890
there thank you everyone thanks for
coming
