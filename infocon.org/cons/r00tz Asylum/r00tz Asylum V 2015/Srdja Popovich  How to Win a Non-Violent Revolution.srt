1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
hi great to be here at DEFCON and let me
try to introduce myself I'm one of those

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,030
people are store mention who was not
getting the good lottery ticket so I was

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:15,899
not really born in a free country I was
born in the country far away from here

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,310
place called serbia but that was very
much like you when I was there I was

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,919
kind of curious and interested and stuff
like that I will try to talk about this

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,269
phenomenon of the social movements and
how common people and kids like you can

7
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:34,670
change the world and it may sound silly
may sound crazy but it's not always

8
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:40,309
about the big masses and great figures
do recognize the figure out there yes

9
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:45,419
margaret king civil rights movement then
the guy down there

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,920
Mohandas Gandhi so people have this
crazy idea that if you really want to

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,120
make a change you need a great leader
and very inspirational figure well

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,559
that's partly true they help alot but
the substances that it is always the

13
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:04,069
common people who create a change in a
great social movement so talk about

14
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:08,830
defeating the tears or changing the
world for the better place this is how

15
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:14,920
this people look this is me when I was a
little bit older than you I started as a

16
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,990
base guitar player in a rock band and
wasn't really thinking that activism

17
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,080
school or you know it makes any sense
but because the serbia had a very very

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,908
bad president called slobodan milosevic
who was in charge radical cleansing and

19
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:34,750
five civil wars we need it somehow to
figure out how to get rid of them so we

20
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:40,850
started building 492 the way to 98 and
basically we ended up running the

21
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:47,298
movement of 70,000 people they
originated in the movement was 21 mins

22
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:51,740
majority of the people in the movement
were what you americans would call

23
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,679
underage we were not allowed to buy
beers but we were capable of organizing

24
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,180
the movie

25
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,650
want and kicking out the bad guy how do
we have done it it's a great question

26
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:09,810
and I'll try to give you the few ideas
on how can you disobey and how can you

27
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,610
get your own freedom first of all how
many you like to disobey your parents

28
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:23,330
come and come out here and you can show
hands yes now try to teach you the

29
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,360
organized way to do it I'm 42 and I'm
still sick when my mom tries to

30
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,580
terrorizing me so it's not related to
the age and you know wake up you will

31
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,670
never get rid of your parents care in
your life are tied to teacher this who

32
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:41,549
has power in this moment obviously we're
holding my you know and you know whoever

33
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:46,830
is on the states now what I learned you
a little trick how to dismantle does

34
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,570
dictator here and you can use it when
you want to kick me out of the state

35
00:02:50,570 --> 00:03:08,450
I'll tell the people I know well I was
sitting in ethnic studies too late

36
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:18,200
know what you figure out is that you are
obstructing my speech now what if you

37
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,609
know the trick and just turn the chairs
around now instead of you i'm talking to

38
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:28,310
your back or your ASUS or you can leave
and leave the room the trick is like

39
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,540
there are so many different tactics to
dismantle the power but they need

40
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,349
numbers if only clapping hands was
limited to hear it will not work soon

41
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:41,280
need to spread the word you need to
build numbers so instead of long

42
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,319
speeches I will give you the real
masters speech to build numbers and it's

43
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,880
not very difficult than building a
little legal town the guy name is Derek

44
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,349
C worse and that are going to look very
funny idea on how you can actually build

45
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:08,268
the movement ok ready of we go and a lot
of leadership in making a movie and

46
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:12,290
let's watch movement happen start to
finish in under three minutes and

47
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,930
dissect some lessons first of course the
leader needs the guts to stand alone in

48
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,160
the critically but what he's doing is so
simple it's almost instructional this is

49
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,639
key

50
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,260
you must be easy to follow now here
comes the first follower with the

51
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,469
crucial role

52
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,360
publicly shows everyone else how to fund
them notice had leader embraced him as

53
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,830
unique so it's not about the leader
anymore it's about them is calling to

54
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:42,669
his friends to join in she takes guts to
be a first-ballot you stand out

55
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,570
ridicule yourself being a first follower
is an underappreciated form of

56
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:54,370
leadership the first phone transforms
into a leader the leader is the plant

57
00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:01,620
the first follower is this is the second
phone this is a turning point it's proof

58
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,440
the first has done well now it's not
have known and it's not two not three is

59
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:12,230
a crowd and the crowd is news a movement
must be public lecture outsiders see

60
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,100
more than just the leader everyone needs
to see the following words because new

61
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,230
followers emulate not the leader

62
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:24,970
more people than three more immediately
now we've got momentum is the tipping

63
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,780
point and now we have a move

64
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:32,049
as more people jump in its no longer
risky if they were on the fence people

65
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:38,139
for no reason not to join in now they
won't stand down they won't be ridicule

66
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:43,160
and they will be part of the in crowd if
they hurry over the next minute you'll

67
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,940
see the rest who prefer to stay part of
the crowd because eventually they

68
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,080
ridiculed for not joining and ladies and
gentleman that is how movement is made

69
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,490
so let's recap if you are a version of
the shirtless dancing guy all alone

70
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,890
remember the importance of nurturing
your first equals making everything

71
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,849
clearly about the movie not be public

72
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,550
be easy to follow but the biggest lesson
here

73
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,870
leadership

74
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:20,070
guess it started with the shirtless guy
and he'll get all the credit that you

75
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:25,719
saw what really happened it was the
first family that transformed into a

76
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,710
leader

77
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:32,640
there's no movement without the first
that we all need to be leaders that

78
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,560
would be affected the best way to make a
move if you really care is too rigid

79
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,990
Sleepy Hollow and show others

80
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,960
when you find a lone nut doing something
great

81
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:58,669
have the guts to be the first person to
stand up join it

82
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:04,790
ok getting the idea it's a guy who get
three million views on that and there is

83
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,710
so much interesting things you can see
all around the net and now we are living

84
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,900
in Diedra lot of stuff can be done over
the network through the net you'll learn

85
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,510
how to break up your phone you will
learn how to protect your communication

86
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:22,340
you learn all of this stuff but never
forget that at the beginning of every

87
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,599
movement there are like three things
that can turn alone not into a People

88
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,330
Power hero crystal them is of course
that dream you want to think about what

89
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,890
a better world is in that store says you
need to embrace the fact that other

90
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:44,169
people may not be as happy as you are
and be born in democratic countries only

91
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:50,010
to find a way to help them I spent most
of my life traveling around the globe

92
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,719
meeting the people from dictatorships
and trying to teach them how to build

93
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,130
non-violent movement second it takes
courage it easier to go with the flow

94
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:04,870
but never tried to kill that kid and a
teenager in you and stay rebellion use

95
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:10,030
that guarantees for a far more
fulfilling life though the most of all

96
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,429
be creative

97
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,930
there's some very very strange weapons
against the dictators and some cases the

98
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,980
humor is the weapon you need we used a
lot of humor in our own struggle and

99
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,780
throw the world you can see very young
people using a lot of great humor

100
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:31,539
against the very very bad guy now what
the humor has with dictatorships and

101
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,789
democracy and why the dictators a drugs
this is yet

102
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:58,719
case for another video this time a
little bit on the immediate

103
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,860
today in our manual of non-violent
struggle we talk about the power of

104
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,819
human and how it can change society's we
all love jokes blonde jokes have to do

105
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:12,889
with revolutions you're about to find
out for centuries social scientists have

106
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:17,600
been linking revolution with conditions
they will say things like you can't make

107
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,009
a revolution if you don't have many
educated people people are living in

108
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:27,560
villages people are happy or well paid
conditions conditions conditions

109
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,859
well here is a new lesson to be learnt
is not about conditions it's about

110
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:37,079
emotions emotions are the driving force
of people look at the faces of the

111
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:41,959
traditional revolutionaries deadly
serious and they shouldn't be since

112
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:45,869
there in the serious business of
revolution or should they

113
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:52,089
the modern-day revolutionaries don't
agree they sing dance whistle smile and

114
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:56,790
look like they're at carnival so the
question is what is the real face of

115
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:02,910
revolution serious or smiling let's get
back to science once more the studies

116
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,110
show that if you're serious armed
revolutionaries your chances for success

117
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:12,870
26% if you're ridiculous looking
non-violent revolutionaries

118
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:19,290
twice as large as those last things city
looking guys are not silly after all

119
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,589
believe it or not but humor is one of
the most powerful weapons in the fight

120
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:29,319
against authoritarianism there are three
main reasons for that firstly human

121
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:33,809
melts here and dictators need fear in
order to survive

122
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:38,750
secondly human makes your movement look
cool and if your movement is cool

123
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:43,230
everyone wants to join us making it
bigger and stronger

124
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:50,420
humor and mockery can create a huge
dynamic now this is an important point a

125
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,130
dilemma action is a powerful tool for
every non-violent group through a

126
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:00,330
nonviolent civil action you can created
damned if you do damned if you don't

127
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:05,610
dilemma for your opponent if they react
they look stupid if they don't they will

128
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,140
look weak and other people will start
knocking them as well when faced with

129
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,310
lacked a brazen mockery oppressive
regimes have no good choices whatever

130
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:20,819
they do they lose a good example of
dilemma action comes from Russia there

131
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,100
in bar now an anti-government protest
featured dozens of toys standing out in

132
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,990
the snow of a Siberian city with banners
complaining about corruption and

133
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,700
electoral malpractice it was only toys
no humans allowed the story came to the

134
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,470
Kremlin and the authorities decided toys
cannot hold protest because they're not

135
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:47,340
citizens of russia they banned a protest
by 100 kinder eggs 100 Lego people

136
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:54,880
twenty model soldiers 15 soft toys and
10 toy cars that's the ground lesson

137
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,830
here is dictators lack a sense of humor
and humor is more powerful even then the

138
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:05,980
army loft of -ism is there to help put
the politicians back to their senses and

139
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,600
empower common people effectively
communicate a positive image of

140
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,860
non-violent struggle and can easily win
the sympathy of the international

141
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,820
community of course just because
laughter in non-violent struggle is fun

142
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,150
it doesn't mean that it is easy on the
contrary laugh tourism requires a

143
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:30,520
constant stream of creativity to stay in
the news headlines in tweets as well as

144
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,720
to maintain its momentum bear that in
mind until our next episode when we will

145
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,370
talk about

146
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:46,560
media and keep on changing the world
with a smile on your face so that's not

147
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,670
a great lesson is like use your
creativity and user creamer and I think

148
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:57,360
this is like the great thing that we
often oversee is that real change should

149
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,720
happen in from our heads and how many of
you are familiar with the characters on

150
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,910
the picture now who are these people

151
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:17,199
Harvard Square hope it's tiny small
people with big hairy legs who love to

152
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,420
lay back have a good meal and rest and
enjoy life are the best equip people to

153
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:31,079
fight the bad guys not really but it was
their role to take that ring to Mordor

154
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:37,190
so the ground lesson here as much as in
Lord of the Rings it is the decision of

155
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:41,810
these people and sometimes destiny and
there is great quote from the movie that

156
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:46,979
even the smallest creature can change
the world so don't forget whatever

157
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,070
happens it has to be you

158
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:56,390
it has to be used starting this thing it
has to be you joining the shirtless guy

159
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:01,680
it has to be you challenging the
authority it has to be you changing the

160
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,239
world because it's often orbits that
bring those big change to the role thank

161
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,420
you for your attention

162
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:27,069
now we have time for question or two yes

163
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:32,340
it's a great and I think what you said
is the following the following of more

164
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:37,560
Valdemar as following of the tears of
income from fear and it is the great

165
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,709
thing to break the sphere and show that
fear is senseless in the same time the

166
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:46,850
following of Harry Potter or you know
the good results are coming from love

167
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:52,300
but those of friendship and loyalty and
courage and these are the things you

168
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,229
want to nurture your movement you want
people in your movement to love each

169
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:00,200
other you want people in your movement
to stand what was a charter and you

170
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,510
really want to respect and share with
your leaders and you want to embrace

171
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:08,900
your followers as Harry did with three
of his friends as equals

172
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:14,220
yes he is the star of the movie but then
you know it's also his friends like

173
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,740
Weasley will also take playing the
important role so very much like a

174
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:23,140
holiday party want to build your
movement based on love and equality and

175
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,060
mutual respect it's a great movie to
watch to understand the struggle between

176
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:40,969
good and evil thank you for that
question and you

177
