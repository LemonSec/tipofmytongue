1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:07,939
alright so we'll start with simple
survey raise your hand if you have a

2
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:16,939
smartphone or iPad k keep your head up
raise your hand if you've ever bring

3
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:21,019
your hand down if you've ever heard
anything on it from the App Store Google

4
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:27,299
Play keep your head up if you've ever
installed an app ok now you have noticed

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,239
it's almost all of you right now

6
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:32,840
keep your head up if you know what those
after saying and who they're saying it

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:39,090
to do you know what the app is doing and
you've you've checked yourself you've

8
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,210
gone and you've looked at the connection
to put your hand out how many hands up

9
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:52,130
right now so this tool that you use
every day with you all say that you have

10
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:57,900
is doing stuff that you don't know what
it's doing some people use it for

11
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,690
banking some people use it for health
some people use it for games that's the

12
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,640
games maybe not so much but banking and
Howson some of the other stuff that's

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,550
pretty private information would you go
to somebody who didn't meet on the

14
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,690
street and give them your banking
password but you go to your smartphone

15
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,880
and you give it your banking password
but you don't know who's talking too so

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,270
that's the goal of my talk right now is
to talk about how do you find out what

17
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,310
are the apps doing and which absurd
spying on me and how do I know whether

18
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:35,110
or not I can trust you now and should I
even use it I lie I work with the wicker

19
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:40,530
foundation with Nico where nonprofit
helping people like this I'm helping

20
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,159
with roots that's my email address and
that's my wicker I D and then after this

21
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,400
presentation if you want to see what up
sir spying on you come back to me over

22
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,880
there and I'll show you how to do this
yourself so let's start with the demo I

23
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,830
want to start with

24
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:02,660
a program called charles proxy it's a
man in the middle of proxy and I will

25
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,030
show you how to install this you can
also use other man in the middle proxies

26
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,390
sorry I don't have the ability to do it
here but I have an iPad and it set up to

27
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,929
use my proxy and I just want to show you
when Apple quick to see what what's the

28
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,390
upset and I you know I don't feel so
good sometimes so I have an app called

29
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,470
WebMD they're one of the most popular
health at out there so let's see what

30
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,520
WebMD says Simon open up WebMD well
right off the bat just pushing the

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,480
button I already see another little
small look at how many people whether he

32
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,730
is already just saying I turned on WebMD
to know some of those are whether indeed

33
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,250
but I got scorecard research media
analytics AP a top stream all those guys

34
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,000
know right off the bat that I've just
open the app I haven't even checked for

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,580
anything and they're already told him
third parties that I maybe have a health

36
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,890
condition now we went in and took a look
at the Kim Kardashian just to see what

37
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:02,720
that was doing that's sending 211
domains 15 trackers analyzers are

38
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,250
behavioral profiling things and 11
domains for content and only look look

39
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,540
at the percentages only half are using
encrypted connections now maybe Kim

40
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,530
Kardashian isn't that big of a deal but
maybe that's not something you want

41
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,860
people to know in the world and it's
sending it to all those people we

42
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,090
lawyers before even agreeing to the
application agreement you're already

43
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,750
sitting in this place called 207 doubt
that many people on a diet went 20 7.net

44
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,780
that you're on a diet or how often you
open it up or how well you're keeping to

45
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,470
that day now

46
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,450
good apps people keep asking me what are
good apps good apps is a strange concept

47
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,130
because it depends on your definition of
good but one of the things that is

48
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,090
really useful in the USA as we have this
law called Coppa childrens Online

49
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,930
Privacy Protection Act and by law if
your app targets people under a certain

50
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,390
age you have some privacy requirements
by the government

51
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,899
you don't if you're an adult at like
WebMD so the children's outs generally

52
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,000
are better because they have so many
requirements

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,910
so it doesn't collect personal
information so there's nothing private

54
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,230
descent right this is for the Smurfs at
two still bad actors but generally it's

55
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,180
kids out your little bit better off
doesn't mean you should trust them to

56
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,860
you what would I do I would double check
your kids and what it's ending before

57
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,550
you let them play it

58
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,900
couple different things to change
speaking at some other things to allow

59
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,590
the SSL breaking that doesn't
necessarily mean it stronger but it's a

60
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,799
little bit better

61
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,360
tender these things are encrypted
generally if you pay for the app they

62
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,820
don't have the ads and therefore there's
less people they talk to you if the app

63
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,990
is free they have to make their money
somehow nobody giving anything away for

64
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,800
free and commercial and society unless
they're a non-profit like quicker

65
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,020
foundation so if the app is paid for

66
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,130
generally they don't spend money also on
developers to integrate third parties

67
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:12,080
does that mean you should trust them
what I do check there's one way to know

68
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,070
for sure always assume we're being
watched

69
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,800
assume after watching your reporting the
third parties do not do anything to help

70
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,460
you don't want to be used against you
oftentimes people feel like I go to my

71
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,770
doctor that safe so if I go to my apt at
a medical appt that must be safe to

72
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:32,530
wrong there are laws that control what
your doctors allowed to do that do not

73
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,849
control medical apps and I can tell you
more about that but the apps are not

74
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,200
your doctor they are not covered by
HIPAA they are not required to have your

75
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,090
privacy and how do they do this or how
do I browse securely online there's a

76
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,169
couple options

77
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:51,830
commercial and an amazing VPNs and onion
routing networks will protect your

78
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,030
traffic from people in the middle but
don't protect your traffic from the

79
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,729
people that they're talking to so even
if I had a tour or VPN running with my

80
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:03,690
WebMD yet I still would have said all
that information to all of those people

81
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,810
just because your connection is
encrypted does not mean that the person

82
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,560
you're talking to can be trusted

83
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,390
hard there is no good solution

84
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:18,090
why is there no good solution right now
anybody know

85
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:26,729
how old raps less than 10 years old how
long does it take legislation to go

86
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:34,280
through congress yes so why do you think
there's no allows the cover-ups

87
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,388
exactly so who's responsible for
protecting you if Congress can do

88
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:45,370
anything and yourself and yellow plant
closures don't trust your parents check

89
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:53,510
for yourself you probably know more than
your parents though rate so you're

90
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:58,700
special case gives you a definite how do
you privately use mobile apps it's

91
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,120
currently nearly impossible to use them
privately you can use them encrypted but

92
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,620
it's almost impossible to figure out
what's going on and the only to protect

93
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,350
yourself the only way to know is to
verify first so before you give banking

94
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,660
details open up your banking up before
you give medical details open up the

95
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,169
medical at don't just read the privacy
policies because the privacy policies

96
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:23,080
are written by anybody knew right to
privacy both lawyers and what's the

97
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,659
lawyer's job they do protect you or to
protect the company and are they gonna

98
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,840
do it in a way that scares you are in a
way that sounds good you so should you

99
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,630
trust our privacy policy no matter fact
most of my experiences that the app

100
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,700
doesn't have a privacy policy they're
generally better off because they can't

101
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,830
afford to read our privacy policy which
means they generally can't afford to

102
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,190
hire lawyers it's the really big apps
the ones that have all the money that

103
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,330
have the really good privacy policies
that sound really good but in general

104
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:58,500
are written in a way that have gigantic
loopholes so it is a proxy server I got

105
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,400
five minutes or just go real quick

106
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,840
proxy server is something that sits in
the middle and repeat so if I'm talking

107
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,869
to you I can talk direct or I can tell
him hey tell her I said this and then he

108
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,919
tells you and then you tell him and then
he tells me he and that point is acting

109
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,169
as the proxy server

110
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:18,250
he's the one who's sitting in the middle

111
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,570
there's a couple of different ways you
can do proxy servers you can have the

112
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,630
laptop like mine run a proxy server and
connect to the internet and then have

113
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,750
your iPod connected the app you can also
have a laptop run two separate

114
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,340
over two separate networks bridge
between two network connections one

115
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,810
really good way parents for the you to
do this is by $10 wifi dongle then you

116
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:42,339
can have a wifi external dongle
therefore the external network or WiFi

117
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,710
for an internal network and then you can
capture traffic and see what your kids

118
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:55,300
are doing kids you didn't hear i SAT
that hurt your parents are doing I i

119
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,430
want them to listen to my talk right so
there's one problem with proxy servers

120
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,349
that SSL encrypted you can't break it by
default

121
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,570
how did I get it working on WebMD you
have to install a certificate on your

122
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,140
iPad that makes it think it's a root
certificate and then it can break it

123
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,010
it's a little bit complicated but if you
look at the documentation for proxy

124
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,319
server you do it and what are your
options there are lots of options out

125
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,730
there there's free ones like man in the
middle of which is very popular in

126
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,790
Windows I like charles proxy on the Mac
even though it costs money because it

127
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:32,319
doesn't require a PhD used its just
click and point and they've got really

128
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,550
good instructions and it's well worth
the money

129
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,199
totally up to you I don't care which one
you use just use one

130
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,580
the way I set this up just now I had a
$10 wifi adapter this is a different

131
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,620
picture but you get the picture

132
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,850
how to set it up you download the proxy
server to your computer you make sure

133
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,160
your network and your your computer and
your your iPad on the same network wifi

134
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,270
you do some stuff that's all there when
you install the root cert to break SSL

135
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:07,170
connections your iPad I thought whatever
you're doing is no longer secure people

136
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,280
have access to that route serves as well
as you so once you've done testing

137
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,990
removed they ripped off of your thing
and don't keep that routes are down when

138
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,050
you go to public numbers like DEFCON so
I'm gonna have to reformat my iPad wanna

139
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,969
go home do this after testing you've
been warned

140
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,880
final but assume you being watched

141
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,210
you know my recommendations and that's
me in my contact info and I got three

142
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:37,080
minutes for questions anybody yes

143
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:43,070
good question

144
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,850
Google how do you get around this is
updating its not easy and there are some

145
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,970
sites that now are on and there are
those sites doing it to stop exactly

146
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:58,320
this so it's complicated it's not super
easy but for the majority of apps

147
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,910
they're not that comp they're not that
complex I mean you saw the WebMD was

148
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,010
doing right those guys have a huge dev
team in five years it will be a

149
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,250
different thing but five years ago this
didn't even exist will be different

150
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,120
tools and they'll be different hacks I
bet you somebody at DEFCON can see you

151
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,370
done in five minutes and do it

152
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:23,050
other questions yes sir so they're
different groups doing different things

153
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,569
some really good ones are the eff one of
our partners and sponsors thank you to

154
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:33,970
the eff the ACLU has some aspect in it
there's a group out of Dec called Epic

155
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,620
Yarn by gonna mark broken road in Bergen
he's really into it

156
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,810
there's a bunch of other ones as well I
can give you a list and then there's

157
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:47,920
some ones that I don't trust is much
basically though so there's a group

158
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,189
called trustee which has little logos
that come on the page but they're paid

159
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:57,870
for by the company's so you have to when
you're evaluating a group to figure out

160
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,090
where to donate your time your money to
figure out where the money comes forum

161
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,780
that drives the group and then decide
whether or not you think their interests

162
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,850
are aligned with yours if their money is
coming from the people who they're

163
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,460
watching you need to in my mind question
that if the money is coming from private

164
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,690
donations

165
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,420
it's there but really it's all that the
individuals to look at what they've

166
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,920
written on line look at what they've
published look at who they are look at

167
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,839
their backgrounds go to the contact list
that's the best way to go and ask your

168
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,530
network you've got a great network of
people I know a number of individuals

169
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:33,579
Nico knows probably the whole world of
individuals so there's lots of people

170
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:38,960
that I got thirty seconds any other
questions thank you very much
