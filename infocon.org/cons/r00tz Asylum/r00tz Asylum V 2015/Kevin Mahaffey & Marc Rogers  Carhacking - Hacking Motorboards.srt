1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:10,850
so we are Mark and Kevin are Mark and
Kevin and we hacked to death so we're

2
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:18,380
here to talk a little bit we did so many
of you saw the a group of hackers here

3
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,590
presented some research around hiking
Jeep as great research

4
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,920
Jeep was only able to do is they
actually had to recall one point four

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,140
million carts and that's that's
certainly not good right it's imagine if

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,418
you have to have a plan update your
computer and you have to bring it to the

7
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:36,578
shop to get the update applied which is
clearly crazy we're really excited to

8
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,850
see a lot of the stuff we're gonna talk
about those able to fix just by pushing

9
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,210
it over the air update their job lot
easier

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:50,460
thought about security for the beginning
then that's that's really good so why do

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:50,860
we have

12
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,760
well it's the coolest car on the road
it's got the most connectivity it's got

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,829
the most computer systems and we thought
as a result it's going to be the most

14
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:05,199
interesting kodak but we also thought to
be a reference model what's out there we

15
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,520
kind of wanted to see what the best
manufacturer was doing what the issues

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,860
they had were what the opportunities
were and also what were the cool things

17
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,440
we could do with a car

18
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,170
so you may see a lot of these new house
right now

19
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,190
well maybe not the steel mill but
everything in the world right now is

20
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,670
becoming connected so there is this a
lot of industries have previously

21
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,120
produced machines that were not
connected to the internet now they are

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,070
connected the internet and is expected
to be about 25 billion of these things

23
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,539
so you may think of computers is just
the thing on your desk in your pocket

24
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,630
but nowadays computers are going to be
everywhere and so we we really need to

25
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,550
make sure that ahead of all these things
becoming connected we make them secure

26
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52,300
and she might ask the question is all
these companies start building things

27
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,610
that are connected to internet and they
don't have experience doing that they

28
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,530
they they don't have experience in
security and asking the right questions

29
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,570
that a lot of you are learning today
some bad things happen you might ask the

30
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,728
question of are the best practices when
people are building new systems they

31
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,240
might say all I know the check for is my
data encrypted you know and my brother

32
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,240
patch process in place and if there are
these best practices in place then

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,860
really bad things happened everyone just
kind of doesn't pay attention to

34
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,540
security in March straight up into a pit
of lava if there are best practices in

35
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,140
place then even companies that maybe
don't take security as their their

36
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,470
immediate goal they just if they follow
everyone else they can be more or less

37
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,660
ok so that's that's really what we're
trying to do is help get those best

38
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:47,070
practices in place so first we have a
public safety announcement you have to

39
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,010
be careful you have to be really careful
when you have to go because cars not

40
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,579
just a computer it's a computer that
travels around a hundred miles an hour

41
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,170
and when you get things wrong really bad
things can happen

42
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:05,890
you're not likely to see the just a
traditional kind of blue screen when it

43
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:13,480
crashes when you packaged cargo it could
really crash so we created some rules of

44
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,840
engagement and these words were all
about making sure that we didn't do

45
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,620
anything that was unethical but also
making sure that we didn't kill

46
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,960
ourselves or destroy $100,000 car icon
for to repay

47
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,880
the rules we had with vegetable when you
have connected things it's actually

48
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,220
sometimes really difficult to tell
whether you're hiking the connected

49
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,330
thing whether you actually had the
company the collected things connected

50
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:43,510
to and we didn't want to accidentally
had to happen said the FBI after us so

51
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,299
first rule was to make sure we stopped
only to the infotainment systems and

52
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,790
didn't cross over into tehsils own
systems didn't interact with that it has

53
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,340
a service and that we didn't make any
permanent modifications to software loss

54
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,970
was particularly important because when
you have the control systems for a car

55
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:07,980
and it's what you call a black box hack
blackspot hacking is when you don't know

56
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,920
what it is you don't know what the
effect of changing some of the toughest

57
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,500
that file that you just changed might
actually control the brakes and if you

58
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,660
make a little changed to it will you
know the breaks no longer work on the

59
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,890
car so we want to do everything in a
number of permanent way try to stay in

60
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:32,789
memory where possible and in particular
not have to call while traveling at 70

61
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:39,490
miles an hour on the freeway so many of
you have seen these things called bug

62
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,390
burnings and actually what it is is
companies say hey you can hack these

63
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,770
things you can go to this website and
try to Hackett and you have immunity

64
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,419
from law enforcement from getting in
trouble if you followed various

65
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,740
responsible hiking practices and
disclosure practices and what that means

66
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:04,050
is if you maybe there's a website or
system and you try to say hey find some

67
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,350
sort of bug whether it be a sequel
injection or or any sort of problem with

68
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,800
it if you promise not to destroy data or
otherwise

69
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,740
break the site for other people and as
soon as you find bugs you tell the

70
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,330
company they actually allow you to go
how these things which is a really great

71
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,000
thing that a lot of companies are
putting in place

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,320
test will put in 14 the car itself so I
wanna talk a little bit about what what

73
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,820
is in the car so

74
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:32,550
it's not just a car it actually has
three servers inside one of the servers

75
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,290
runs the instrument cluster which is
where you see the speed and

76
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:41,200
functionality the car i buy the steering
wheel the second is the touch screen

77
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,729
called the CID that's the big 17 inch
touchscreen the middle of the car it's

78
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,000
really cool has a web browser you can
browse Facebook Twitter so on and so

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,900
forth and then there's something inside
the car called the gateway and the

80
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:58,020
gateway is how these entertainment
systems that the touch screen in the

81
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,530
instrument cluster communicate with the
vehicle breaks the acceleration the air

82
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,830
bags and all that and of course you can
imagine the the vehicle is really really

83
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:11,940
like definitely does not cannot be act
right that's very very bad at that that

84
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,690
gets compromised and so this Gateway
sits between the infotainment and the

85
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,770
vehicle to make sure that even if the
infotainment systems get hacked

86
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:29,630
you can't get into the safety systems so
how can the car was kind of like the

87
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:34,420
Olympics R us we literally had to use
almost every discipline of packing

88
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:40,260
because to compromise the the system we
have to go through all sorts of

89
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:45,380
different little steps to get little
bits of access this kind of how a lot of

90
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,650
pensions work although not quite as
extreme know you might find that there's

91
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,289
an open door lets you get into the
office and then you might find that

92
00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:01,790
there's a mock carbon which has a reuter
and say you use lockpicking to get outta

93
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:07,380
selected then when you find a switch
which has poor network access controls

94
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,100
you will use that to get access to the
network that kind of stuff and this is

95
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,840
actually very much how it worked the car
used hardware hacking wireless hacking

96
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,539
network hacking hacking by reverse
engineering protocol reverse engineering

97
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,460
and custom cultural development as a lot
of stuff that's one of the reasons why

98
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,870
it took so long gone

99
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,470
impact

100
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:37,270
what you see in the next what you see on
the screen is a Model S with SH back

101
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,890
door installed and what happens on who
appeared of access there are no parties

102
00:07:41,890 --> 00:08:17,650
anywhere

103
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:51,730
first in this case a car we actually had
to disassemble the car and of course

104
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,450
when you're disassembling $100,000 car
you want to be extremely careful so the

105
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,290
screws that are used in the car you can
get from Amazon you get the screwdrivers

106
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,670
a special security bed and if you ever
removing door panels you wanna get these

107
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,719
orange drop panel removers because it's
very hard to remove them just with your

108
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,600
hands and you basically use the door
panel members to pry off the various

109
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,350
panel and you're really trying to get
these these little metal clips they're

110
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,240
terrible and you have to pull that 10%
harder than you think you think you're

111
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,110
about to break this very expensive car
and then you pull a little bit harder

112
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,880
than they call him off nicely that
they're they're really kind of a pain in

113
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,150
the butt and showers are breaking
plastic are expected so the first thing

114
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,329
we were able to disassemble was the
instrument cluster this is the thing

115
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:43,339
right above the steering wheel so we
pulled it apart and as you can see we

116
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:47,970
opened up the circuit court this is the
front of the instrument cluster and you

117
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,930
can see and what we're looking for is is
there anything that might give us some

118
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:55,290
information is there a USB port we can
plug into their memory card is there

119
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:01,630
anything we can take a look at nothing
here and I'm back whenever the financing

120
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,700
as well so that really wasn't a lot of
help so we went to the touch screen this

121
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,930
is the back of that center touchscreen
lot of cables if you disassemble

122
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,810
anything this complex would recommend
labeling the cables if they're not

123
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,300
colored luckily with the test so they
were all color it was a little buddies

124
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,889
here but you definitely don't wanna
unplugged 15 cables and

125
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:27,959
they come back in that could certainly
be bad we opened up the touch screen and

126
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:34,238
we we looked around say is there any
other things we could find a removable

127
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:39,269
memory card alright without another
removable memory card to cut two memory

128
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:49,660
cards to work with and without a USB
port that the best thing we found was

129
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,899
that mysterious cable I like mysterious
cables because usually they used for

130
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:59,540
people when they're trying to fix the
car and that means they do special

131
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:07,998
things special foods almost always means
access we also found a number of

132
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:12,669
different things like . diagnostic
interfaces the removal memory cards

133
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:19,029
mentioned USB when your hardware hacking
you basically looking for anything that

134
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:23,919
you can use to give you some kind of
access is if you think about was on a

135
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:29,019
server you have a password to get into
the server by looking for hardware

136
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:32,720
things you looking for a way around it's
kind of like if you were trying to get

137
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,369
into a house and you don't want to go
through the front door you kind of

138
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:39,790
walking around looking for open windows
instead

139
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:45,988
all right now that we have the memory
cards to work with mysterious cables

140
00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:52,980
let's go and see what we can do look
inside the memory cards we found one

141
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:58,179
which had called car keys and inside the
car keys we found some really

142
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:02,589
interesting things these are
cryptographic private keys which are

143
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:07,189
typically used to prove that you are who
you say you are just as a remote system

144
00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:10,779
that's a very interesting we didn't
immediately know what they were but

145
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:15,110
there was this certainly good and then
we had another card which had a bunch of

146
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:21,379
mapped it on it in a script that we
would we potentially could run to gain

147
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:29,149
access code we've now reached a point
where car keys are electronic digital

148
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:34,189
certificate is kind of a fundamental
change in the way things used to be the

149
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:42,299
way things are going and of course the
most report what you do you connect with

150
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:48,809
them and what we found was playing with
the sport was it's basically the

151
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:54,389
physical network you would find in
office all the computers are connected

152
00:12:54,389 --> 00:13:03,139
to the presence of Ethernet means for
more wheels be means we can now connect

153
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:07,610
into it and talk to those servers almost
as if you walked into an office and

154
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:15,249
plugged into a switch and started
talking to the service so we we started

155
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:19,789
exploring the internal and in the first
thing we found was just a huge amount of

156
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:21,039
data flying over this thing

157
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,689
500,000 packets per second and so we had
no idea what we've been doing this is

158
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:30,579
way too much needed even so we end at
all some of you may know called and map

159
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:34,339
the really great or anytime you're
trying to explore network very easy to

160
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:39,999
use and what is running on this network
without a whole bunch of things one of

161
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:46,429
which is something called x11 x11 is
what is used in Linux UNIX operating

162
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:52,350
systems to basically it's the windows of
Lenox yes it's the graphical interface

163
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,309
for UNIX systems and so we this is about
three in the morning we had a long day

164
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:59,339
of hacking we found this we had a little
fun and we decided to put some pictures

165
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,160
up on

166
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,100
on the instrument cluster and the touch
screen and then we looked at like 10

167
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:12,579
what else one of one of the things we
found was called the icy updater this

168
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:16,930
was on both the cluster and the
touchscreen

169
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:33,079
up laters that when you ask for status
it wasn't a whole bunch of data to

170
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:55,980
it's fantastic

171
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,470
told us all sorts of stuff about the
state of the systems because of discs

172
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,290
inside and the very large when you see
the bottom there which was the most

173
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:10,579
amazing one didn't appear when the first
few times actually only period when the

174
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,710
car was waiting to download an update on
what he gives out is the URL to download

175
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:22,100
the firmware being able to download the
firmware is the holy grail what it means

176
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:28,920
is we gotta pull down the file system
and that would enable us why to being

177
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,390
able to get access the servers to
actually look at what's installed on

178
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:44,170
them so you're all this is the firmware
but as soon as we did that we had a

179
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:50,110
setback when this happens a lot in
long-term projects progress and then

180
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,800
something happens and smoke progress so
patients is one of the most important

181
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,140
things with any big mac and what what
tested it is a lot of people on the

182
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,880
internet also found that Ethernet port
we talked about and tested blocked it so

183
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,689
now we don't have access to the systems
anymore but he said well done we do know

184
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:12,290
that the instrument cluster about the
steering wheel can still talk to the

185
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:12,800
internet

186
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,270
well what do you do with that well we
said well what if we get in between the

187
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:22,760
instrument cluster and the rest of the
car and actually up to anything that's

188
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:29,130
what we did is we we basically the
instrument cluster where you can see

189
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,010
there is actually scotch tape because
you have to insulate the cable so they

190
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,040
don't touch the metal parts don't touch
and we couldn't find any cable there

191
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,400
were small enough so we had to make our
own very high tech

192
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:47,110
another kind of classic thing in hacking
you don't always go through the back

193
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,400
door down the security this in front of
you

194
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,569
Tesla built this very sophisticated very
elaborate method for authenticating

195
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:04,020
anything connected to that mysterious
dangling cable is a great solution send

196
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:11,500
a specific token to a specific port to
say you have access and then instead of

197
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:17,800
going through the really complicated and
difficult process of security we went

198
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:26,990
around it and we used another device for
us this is classic thinking by plugging

199
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:32,660
a switch into the instrumentation
cluster the instrumentation cluster with

200
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,760
authenticate all switch on our behalf
and we could plug any laptops we wanted

201
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,730
into the switch and we had access
without even having to worry about is

202
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:48,990
highly sophisticated and very liberal
indications so the breakthrough

203
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:55,670
hadn't been giving us the download euro
until one day when there was an update

204
00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:04,060
waiting for the car and suddenly this
year or was there with the car keys that

205
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:11,110
we've had before we realized we have
your own site as network and be we have

206
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,669
a way to connect to test the network

207
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:23,370
pmish was a little bit difficult but
thankfully due to global settings set up

208
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:28,439
in these things actually tell you all
the configuration you need we set it up

209
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,470
we connected to terms with network and
we downloaded it and I was trying to

210
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:40,590
point out that we debated this for like
two weeks which was crossing the ethical

211
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:45,889
boundaries said if we didn't want to go
into tears that what we did was we just

212
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,530
acted as the car did the only thing only
what the car would do

213
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:57,629
that this was safe so we did it and got
a large amount of data later we had a

214
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:09,150
filesystem found a bunch of stuff and we
just started tearing through it trying

215
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,520
to figure out what was in it are there
any are there any weaknesses we could

216
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,620
use to take advantage of to get access
to the systems and so of course one of

217
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,919
the goals of any sort of Unix System is
when you see it you need to get a shot

218
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,350
count you need to be able to get log
into the system and do stuff but from

219
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,790
the outside we didn't have the passwords
we didn't know what to do so we of

220
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:34,639
course we said ok we have a file system
what we do you know the first thing you

221
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,260
tend to look for in a file system is
look for private keys these private keys

222
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,650
allow you to authenticate to a remote
server and gain access to it we didn't

223
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:47,550
find any private use but we did find
what's called the shadow file so when

224
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,600
you when you type in password into your
computer that passwords actually not

225
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,840
stored in plain text that would be
really terrible instead there's an

226
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:00,500
encrypted version of that passwords
stored and for really complex passwords

227
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,880
almost impossible to crack them before
really simple password you can get them

228
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:10,650
quite easily and you can correct them
and we're in this shot blocker called

229
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:15,650
the John the Ripper free open source you
can download a cracked in like a minute

230
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:24,720
when are you coming that fast it tells
you that the password was really really

231
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,040
simple like a dictionary word or name
and I have to admit this point I cried

232
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:37,800
when someone does something to me it's
really disappointing but the big game

233
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,220
hunter stalking through the finest pray
sitting there waiting with a bow tied

234
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,250
around his neck

235
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:51,210
so we had a password we can log into the
instrument cluster and and of course the

236
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,880
next question is okay so you're an
unprivileged user guide you to become

237
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,400
the superuser route

238
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:05,160
well as it turns out which effectively
means is certain users on any given

239
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,360
system are allowed to become superuser
just by asking for it

240
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,090
user and this is OK sure and that kinda
sucks cause that was also really like I

241
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:19,310
was expecting have to do something
really complicated so we went back and

242
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:24,960
said ok we do more from our analysis we
found was we wanted to get access to

243
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,770
that center touch screen at this point
only had access to the instrument

244
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:32,950
cluster what we found was the passwords
to that center touch screen which store

245
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:38,050
in plain text on the instrument cluster
so we can log into that also it was kind

246
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,200
of disappointed we're gonna have to go
through an elaborate hack but we were

247
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,850
able to get access pretty quickly and
again also a suitor so we now all of a

248
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:50,919
sudden we have room on both the
instrument cluster and the touch screen

249
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,400
but it's interesting that you know we
was with you all sorts of effort went

250
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,300
through all sorts of dark alleys and I
couldn't hack anything until we got the

251
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,580
firmware then got the firmware literally
I think it was three and a half hours

252
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:07,020
from the firmware download finish in 10
read on both systems so it's incredible

253
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,300
so you would say anytime you're doing a
big project don't give up you're gonna

254
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,340
think your family and your family and
your family and your family and then all

255
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,199
of a sudden you have one small break
through and in three and a half hours

256
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,670
you on the entire system in this is true
in all things in a very common problem

257
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:28,930
dealing with security even in the
enterprise world often people invest

258
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:34,770
their security into keeping people out
around the edge

259
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:39,180
analogy with your house would be putting
sixteen different kinds of local your

260
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:44,710
front door making sure buyers on the
windows and there's absolutely no way

261
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,930
anyone get through but then you don't
bother having an alarm system and you

262
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:52,310
leave all your jewelry sitting out on
the shelves all your money sitting on

263
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:57,540
the table it's called the actual permit
principle that the perimeters hard and

264
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:03,460
strong but inside source often doing
this is the case the car it's not good

265
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,300
because it means once you crack it but
everything is wide open for you so

266
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:15,120
controlling the vehicle we set up an SSH
tunnel between the CID on the server to

267
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,629
give us remote access to the car used to
control the car

268
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:25,820
largely because kevin was sitting inside
the car i wasnt and we were gonna do

269
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,470
things like the car while it was driving
and I'd rather be a safe distance doing

270
00:23:30,470 --> 00:24:04,930
that

271
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:17,100
when the car stopped if it was traveling
at very low speed the current

272
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,550
immediately apply the brakes on the
touch screen go black and you would kind

273
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:26,210
of stop the music and personally and but
we tried it a little bit higher speed

274
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:31,770
like six or seven miles an hour instead
of the car me playing the brakes the car

275
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,560
would simply shift into neutral so
effectively you can accelerate anymore

276
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,520
but you still had for steering and
braking control which is really actually

277
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,600
quite important we didn't tested at very
high speed for obvious safety reasons

278
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,270
but it shows that there's actually some
robustness in the system

279
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:50,800
the car is acting intelligence if you're
going too fast imagine if I am NOT the

280
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,820
brakes and like stopped the car in the
middle of the highway that would be

281
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,850
extremely dangerous and so it shows that
there's actually some really interesting

282
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:06,929
question is doing about it I'm just
sayin working with total was pretty

283
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,070
phenomenal

284
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:15,159
security researcher you engage in
different ways most times their process

285
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,580
you special follows code responsible
disclosure responsible disclosure is

286
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:24,370
that you take the vulnerabilities you
find you write them up and is always

287
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:29,739
possible and you give them the company
and you give them enough time to engage

288
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,810
and work on the vulnerabilities before
you do anything with them before you go

289
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:40,169
public or before you take them to
conferences some companies will respond

290
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:45,570
by dismissing them some companies will
respond by accepting in thanking you and

291
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,550
then going completely silent or trying
to see you

292
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:54,340
was going to get some companies lawyers
office you telling you that we're well

293
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,909
you found the grimly dangers and
therefore they need to see you soon as

294
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:03,280
it was the best of the best what
happened was they sent engineer's office

295
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,379
which in somebody else's little bit
scary

296
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:12,550
boys in bed rest their headquarters we
had a really really long discussion with

297
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,720
them they talked about the
vulnerabilities and most importantly

298
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:23,580
they asked us what we do and how we go
about fixing this result that was pushed

299
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:29,110
out an OTA update over the air patch the
car's speed so no need to recall the

300
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:34,149
cars just silently this up that goes off
overnight and by the time we gave the

301
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:39,600
talk at DEFCON it was waiting on
everyone's gone to the probabilities we

302
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,990
discovered passwords information
disclosure and other vulnerabilities are

303
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,340
being worked on but this was enough to
prevent people from getting root on

304
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:54,120
their systems using the method described
and they also look to increasing the

305
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,840
hardening of the whole system which is
really important means they went away

306
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,449
from the actual prints having a strong
robust security model for all systems in

307
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:10,630
the car and i wanna see the mic mention
they're really great to work with

308
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:15,530
they actually even sent a lot of their
folks here to DEFCON the city of the

309
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:20,500
whole company came in and and and
actually thanked and wanted to encourage

310
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,590
more people to out of the car which was
really great to see a company saying yes

311
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:28,209
we value the research that people are
doing and we encourage more people to

312
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:31,220
try to hack our cars because they want
to make they believe that when people

313
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,770
try to have their cars and and tell them
about it in a responsible about it

314
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,800
actually makes cars safer as opposed to
just sayn

315
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,129
well you don't have anyone up the car
and we just want to keep it quiet we

316
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,070
don't want anyone to know that there are
about things in our car right and that's

317
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:49,610
really dangerous right because in the
case with you have the good researchers

318
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:53,060
finding bugs you're gonna have safer
cars but in the case were only the bad

319
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,020
researchers are finding bugs you're not
going to know about those bugs until

320
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:02,360
somebody dies in the freeway and that's
clearly not good snow in summary a

321
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:07,729
picture of you as always you can get
into the car and when you notice is at

322
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:11,840
the bottom right hand corner is is kind
of access to the critical vehicle safety

323
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,409
systems and you notice is only really
one way

324
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:17,640
way to get there and that's actually
really really good if you have lots and

325
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,310
lots of ways to talk to the vehicle
safety systems it makes your job much

326
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:25,450
harder for security because there's way
more ways and so the existence of that

327
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:30,530
gateway is actually one of the best
security measures of the car and i know

328
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,670
that Tesla we were working with them
through this this diagram we called the

329
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,880
kill chain you kind of map out all the
way to get access to various parts of

330
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,170
the system they are systematically
trying to block different acts different

331
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:44,220
ways you can get access not only into
the system as a whole

332
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,110
from that Ethernet port but also once
you're in one system how do you block

333
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:52,360
access between systems because you don't
want to have this exile where it's hard

334
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,639
to get in once you're in you get
everything you want to be equally hard

335
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:02,260
to get access to any given part of the
system so we wanted to use this research

336
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,470
as as an example this best practices I
talked about earlier

337
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:08,810
to to really set an example for the rest
of the car industry because of Tesla

338
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:11,990
makes good cars when nobody else does
that doesn't really help the world as

339
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:15,770
much as it possibly could and so it
really want to say is hey what can

340
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,840
everyone else in the world learned from
what tested right and what test did

341
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,179
wrong and I think it starts with
building an architecture that looks like

342
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:27,660
the Model S I'm really what we mean by
that is it has that over the update

343
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:31,120
process and it's also really important
that you don't have to pay any extra

344
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:38,649
money for that update its really really
imagine if you had to subscribe and pay

345
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:43,080
for data plan to get your car fixed
about 20 percent of people out there

346
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,949
would do that so having this work is a
sign that thing is is really really

347
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:52,580
important in other industries we've seen
things like if you look at all the

348
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:59,800
ticket machines significant number of
them using software that's valuable and

349
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,310
all

350
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:08,389
reason it's really hard to take things
bolted to the ground the car park in to

351
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:14,520
get updated and without a mechanism I
think the only way many of the drive to

352
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:20,020
them and plug a laptop in one of them
get patched that's bad for car parks can

353
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,050
you imagine that with millions of cars
on the road

354
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:26,919
we just simply don't wanna go that the
next thing is it's really important that

355
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:32,120
the infotainment systems and the drive
systems are isolated is kind of how they

356
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:36,800
build airplanes today it means if
anything goes wrong doesn't have to be a

357
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:48,750
malicious nothing bad no bad messages
about traffic and affect us a

358
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:56,090
functioning finally each individual
components be hard with embedded systems

359
00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:02,939
approach to the real world when you're
secure to the world when you are

360
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,220
securing a server you know you're
building a box is gonna sit in a

361
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:12,070
datacenter communicates with what's on
it with cameras pointing out it so the

362
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:18,730
only way is by someone connecting to
make open but with an embedded system

363
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:26,230
they can dismantle it and they can
connect cables to every bit of it that

364
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,770
means any single piece of

365
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:41,889
under attack as a result I make sure
that has its own security model and its

366
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:48,020
compromise that doesn't lead to
compromise of the rest of the systems

367
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:58,090
and this is a project nearly twenty
people make this possible so you know

368
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,889
any any sufficiently large project
there's gonna be a ton of people who

369
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,210
contribute to it and and we definitely
want to thank everyone else who put

370
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:10,200
their nights and weekends and one of
whom lend us his car is expensive car

371
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,560
let us do wonderful things to it and and
it said we couldn't have done it without

372
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:22,730
all these people so thanks

373
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:35,679
so many questions

374
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:48,049
possibilities but the point of RXR

375
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:53,210
so we just lost his way in which you
found it when we found that we didn't

376
00:32:53,210 --> 00:33:06,270
get on the entertainment side of all of
the ways in through the entertainment

377
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:13,580
system that's the bit that interacts and
so that means you know you're coming

378
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,110
from the outside world you have to deal
with it if you look at some of the

379
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:23,689
people like Charlie Miller was doing
when they plug into the CANbus those are

380
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:29,990
coming from the car so that those
actions become increasingly unlikely

381
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:35,840
when you look at the Tesla Model S the
port that can actually they can buy COPD

382
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,049
to actually has nothing connected to it
the only reason it's there is a legal

383
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:53,760
requirement so you not coming through
that pool

384
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:03,840
it's effectively NVIDIA Tegra is the
platform that uses so its base in

385
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,889
embedded system by NVIDIA and the USB
port is how you do it loading onto the

386
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:14,220
device it also supports firmware
extraction but it had a password

387
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:18,770
protection enabled then we didn't have
the password so we attempted

388
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,360
actually like what that thing back
together with little USB cable dangling

389
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:28,880
out of the dash plugged into his laptop
but we weren't able to get anything out

390
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:35,240
of the car is being a giant on wheels
and the way you would control the video

391
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:41,719
tab look like always I double the Galaxy
Nexus so one of those is very similar to

392
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:47,928
what you control this piece of software
like Android ADB to talk to a low level

393
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:53,570
and drove home owners but I mention it
was a password on it and we probably

394
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:59,850
could have SAT there and using for it we
found other quicker roots in so we we

395
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:10,299
drop the question was how would you
recommend somebody get into her acting

396
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:18,840
very carefully so it's so there's really
kind of two general routes there is the

397
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,040
end of the Kansas side which is like you
know you get one of those obd2 connector

398
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,960
is in the you plug in and if you go to
the village they have a lot of

399
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,330
exploratory stuff there and then there's
the the digital side of it reaches look

400
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:37,350
at the infotainment systems WiFi
Bluetooth and I i personally think

401
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:41,089
getting into it I think it's probably
safer to explore the digital side and

402
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:44,390
not to the vehicle side because he
touched the wrong things in the vehicle

403
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:50,900
side very very very bad things could
happen quick suggestions as mentioned

404
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,350
with the baby due to poor there are

405
00:35:54,350 --> 00:36:00,279
don't lose you can buy for car
enthusiasts that are read only because

406
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,130
they can't make any change the car but
they give out lots of statistics and

407
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:09,260
information used by people who like to
drive cause really fast you can buy

408
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:13,550
these dongles and connect them to a car
and then read over blue chips and that I

409
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:18,810
would like to see what's going on inside
the cost of the network with that and

410
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:23,970
and and learning about the can
understand all the costs how it works I

411
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:28,080
would suggest talking to some of the
automotive manufacturers because I

412
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,810
strongly suspect after what we've done
they're going to start holding

413
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:37,330
hackathons and they're gonna invite
people to come and start hacking get

414
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:41,910
engaged in one of those see what's going
on maybe just go along and watch and

415
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:48,569
then finally devon has a village you're
gonna see this and more more conferences

416
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:53,500
go that you find people who got a lot of
knowledge and you'll find systems they

417
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:59,400
call box what about his is basically the
additional parts of the car taken out of

418
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,320
the car and set aside for people to run
tests well there is a great for hacking

419
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,130
on because there's no car behind it so
no risk go get action slows and play

420
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:20,590
with us

421
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:26,210
question was the the OTA update what
network with their running over every

422
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,340
test your connection in the USA on AT&T

423
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:34,350
that are you can also connected to your
home wi-fi and if you if you have home

424
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:46,618
wifi dock connector that

425
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:50,369
the question is you know what can you do
to me push on from where modify it

426
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:55,210
the former runs of OpenVPN the
downloaded so it's not just the open

427
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:59,849
Internet so if you could meet in the
middle of BB in connection which we I

428
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:07,529
added that but it's it's actually
potentially possible if you could find a

429
00:38:07,529 --> 00:38:12,749
particular key chains up to Tesla's SSL
certificate authority you could make

430
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:18,629
that connection and potentially push on
from there would be very well we didn't

431
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,710
really need to modify the shadow
passwords because they had really simple

432
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:30,569
passwords and we didn't also mess with
the car was bombed inside that wet patch

433
00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:37,109
we could have met with that on
additional side African them because we

434
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:42,480
don't want to risk it it's all there are
additional blogs is no guide as to which

435
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,130
big draws which and again we just want
to get the scenario where we change if

436
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:53,089
you bid turned off the brakes thank you
