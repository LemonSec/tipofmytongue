00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,360
hi there everybody i'm carole mcsweeney
and I'm whenever federal government

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,360
officials that at DEFCON this year and I
know that sounds kind of probably

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,230
unusual for people last year ago
actually spotted me as the Fed which is

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,189
pretty fun and I wanted to just take a
minute to talk about why the federal

5
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:29,380
trade commission is here at DEFCON
between a couple of things when we're

6
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,510
running a competition in the contest
area which is designed to help us get

7
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,830
better tools and used technologists to
defeat robo calls which are those

8
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,769
annoying phone calls that you get even
if your mobile number if you still have

9
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,190
one landline numbers registered on the
Do Not Call list we did a contest here

10
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,480
last year that was really successful and
we're doing one again this year so we're

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,559
really excited about that but we're also
the part of the federal government that

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,920
really i think is aligned with the white
hat mission and the honor code here in

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,119
truth how to protect consumers and make
sure that they are getting information

14
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,499
about both the security of the
technology that they're using but also

15
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:13,829
what's happening to their information
and things like that in absence and

16
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,649
other technology as they're using it so
we're expanding our reach and research

17
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:22,189
and harnessing the power of
technologists and the research community

18
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:27,589
and hackers to help us protect consumers
in the marketplace and we're really

19
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,829
excited about that mission so our chief
technologist Ashkan Soltani and I are

20
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,798
here this week also giving a talk about
how technologists and hack for

21
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,619
government and we really are excited
about the valuable research and

22
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:46,780
information that we get out of this
community because it helps us bring the

23
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,600
cases that we bring that help protect
consumers in the marketplace and as

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,520
consumers are growing increasingly
connected and we have all these great

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,079
new innovations and devices and
everything else that is wired up in our

26
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,149
lives we're finding that we need a lot
more help from the technology community

27
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:11,890
in order to understand exactly what's
happening to consumers and whether they

28
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,799
are being deceived by promises that are
being made about their privacy whether

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,540
their information it's been adequately
secured and I'm super excited as a

30
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,519
parent five and seven year old who will
probably be he retreats next year that

31
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,880
route is starting from a really young
age to talk about the really valuable

32
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,799
mission that we can bring as researchers
and people understand technology to

33
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,989
protecting consumers I love the Honor
Code out front I think it's terrific and

34
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:47,310
I think this program is so incredibly
important and inspiring young people to

35
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,840
take their talent and know-how and use
it use it for good so I invite you to be

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,239
a part of our mission at the Federal
Trade Commission always happy to answer

37
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,670
any questions we're wandering around
this weekend I would love it if people

38
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,958
visit us in the contest area as well

39
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,170
to find out how we are trying to create
new tools for consumers to help deal

40
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,299
with some of the underlying problems
that come up from members and Robo

41
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,530
colors and things like back thanks for
having me and will be around so I invite

42
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,670
you to come ask questions and thanks for
participating in this terrific program
