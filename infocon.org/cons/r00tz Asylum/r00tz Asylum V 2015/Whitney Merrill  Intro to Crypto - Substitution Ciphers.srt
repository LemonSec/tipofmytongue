1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
hello everyone and to the people that
have my problem thank you so much

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:12,250
my name's with a merrill I am an
attorney and a master's in computer

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:19,020
science at the University of Illinois so
still school as the kid I loved

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,840
I went to little robotics camp very few
options of places could go learn

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,780
basically all the cool stuff you guys
are doing here and so I've been doing it

6
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,590
my whole life all sorts of puzzle and
crypto but my grade school didn't really

7
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,230
have much of a computer science programs
are either doing it really late in life

8
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:48,599
and while school I went to DEFCON and I
was like oh I gotta switch gears and so

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,160
here I am but I ran across your privacy
village I dot com we're in our second

10
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,209
year and so come in here to help and he
drives a little bit of the basics so I'm

11
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,859
gonna give a very very basic talk about
substitution ciphers who in the room

12
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:11,110
does a substitution cipher is we've got
a bunch of you so I would just given by

13
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:17,920
the coolest gift that I've gotten back
on and it is a decoder ring has anyone

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,650
ever seen with those decoder rings look
like we're like there are letters and

15
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,960
numbers on the top and then I know that
on the bottom and basically you can help

16
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:35,780
coded emails yeah so they're they're
really cool and like you can communicate

17
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,110
with your friends so what are the
substitution cipher so you can use

18
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:46,740
letters numbers or pictures and all
those symbols basically you can make up

19
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,899
your own code and substitute for an
alphabet it can be a series of

20
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:58,320
characters for one letter or a series of
credit characters for one word

21
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:06,020
around a really long time Washington you
got no yes during the Revolutionary War

22
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:13,160
coded system where each word that was
regularly use maps out with a left with

23
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,420
the number and so it was a pretty simple
system in that like a was one and maybe

24
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:25,839
forces was 27 but that way they could
only the people who had the book to

25
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:34,760
decode cool like read the message I'm so
they've been used a lot for a long time

26
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:43,730
with modern-day computers substitution
ciphers are the best for encryption it's

27
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,440
not gonna projector data it's going to
be very easy to break with their very

28
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,170
fun and I really I write my friends
puzzle I remain this summer and I would

29
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,238
leave him messages on the bridge he was
trying to get into crypto and I believe

30
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,950
emphasis on the bridge to solve that
work for the day and so I made you guys

31
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,980
how did you make some fossil how do you
solve some puzzles and I'll give you

32
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:17,440
guys a few tools to help you with the
challenge the first one i I have hackers

33
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,730
I have applied a substitution cipher for
each of these were the first one here is

34
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:36,089
it looks like on us and not just simply
shifting the letters 13 times in 2008 if

35
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:43,200
you had thirteen letters turns into you
and I do that for each individual letter

36
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,619
and so the next one here is numbers does
anyone in the room no it doesn't

37
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:57,760
so that's another type of substitution
here we have a value two numbers or

38
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:05,310
alphanumeric characters that equals each
ASCII character and so we have that

39
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,890
setup and then under here I have another
type of substitution cipher we're

40
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:22,289
substituting numbers is just simply
choose where they so what the eighth

41
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:36,760
letter because I'm just simply
substituting so I 8801 for a separate

42
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:43,479
state or out so then we have two other
these are kind of famous picture ciphers

43
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:53,180
I'm what would happen with they've
they've basically drawn out a picture to

44
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,389
you represent each letter of the
alphabet and so you can add these

45
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:03,479
pictures together and have a little bit
more difficult to solve because when you

46
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:10,610
have a picture you can't just put it
into a computer it's a figure out like

47
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,690
you can with texture numbers and then
finally you can have some substitution

48
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:21,210
ciphers that use a combination of
letters and numbers and symbols so

49
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,469
really quickly about thirteen 13 Asst

50
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:34,610
those in the audience who do not
basically shift the top letters 13 times

51
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:42,210
it's also been called the Caesars safer
and this is a very basic way too and so

52
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,919
what you can do with the seas are safer
route 13 as you can really

53
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,600
buildup on it so I was once working on a
puzzle just for fun and I was getting

54
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,750
tripped up and I couldn't figure out I
was working out for quite a bit I was

55
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,040
like I know I'm missing something have
no I'm I know I'm missing something and

56
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,340
then I realized they had turned the
second alphabet they were rotating 13

57
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:10,109
times in delete so he was 3 I was
launched etcetera and it was just that

58
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:16,300
tiny shift in how they did was made it
that much more difficult for me so you

59
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,260
can make your own substitution ciphers
and modify them it's really the best

60
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:28,360
base for doing this type of classical
grupo so here we have a low is turned

61
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,490
into you you are why why be the thing
with this is because each letter

62
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:40,820
represents one other character trait so
we see there's why why so why why is

63
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,469
that was being double letter some of you
think about when you're solving these

64
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:54,520
problems solving these puzzles what
worried it might be in your in your

65
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,270
tripped up if you look for double
characters like that you might be able

66
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,120
to

67
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,930
they ok what what letter in the alphabet
you see next to each other well I see

68
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:12,660
double e double 0 WL you can kind of
guesstimate based on that what the word

69
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:27,620
is a quick puzzle does anyone want to
try to solve it with three ok I've

70
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,470
talked about their safer for which one
do you think it might be what does it

71
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:36,160
look like there's a double be in there

72
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,840
yeah exactly so this is just a basic
Caesar cipher and in my presentation of

73
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:53,020
its all 20 because i dont i dont I
didn't use substitution cipher numbers

74
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:58,770
but the double B and the double B

75
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:05,630
indicating the double oh so the little
bit easier and I you can when you make

76
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:11,280
things safer yourself or your solving
them they can both be smushed together I

77
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,559
love route here and it looks more
complicated cuz i didnt space it out if

78
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,500
you imagine I space it out I put 54 love
and then route you be like ok there are

79
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:29,599
three letters three words here what is
what's the word that only has one letter

80
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:40,330
we have a i maybe you if you're using
you know sort cans but that limits what

81
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:47,080
what it could possibly sought to this is
another way of visual I think these are

82
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,510
safer for you guys

83
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:56,250
you can be wrote each of these around
and what you can choose the and I i wish

84
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,400
i brought them with me but you can take
two pieces of paper

85
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,720
3d printer you can make a really awesome
decoder ring and you can write the

86
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,140
letters of one alphabet on and the other
and you can rotate through to you make

87
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:21,330
your secret message so here are
basically I have welcomed and then I'm

88
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:30,730
decrypting to secret and so I find look
where assets as solved or I go to F in

89
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:40,490
the inner greenery and see that it goes
both ways are familiar think I really

90
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:46,870
love us it's like fun than messages to
your friends using pick and so I have

91
00:09:46,870 --> 00:10:01,710
two puzzles here and I think I'll take
my presentation of well why don't you

92
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:06,250
guys take a few minutes and try to solve
he is and I'll take questions if you

93
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:11,290
don't have anything or you want me to
talk about something more formal I'm

94
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:17,020
also gonna hang around here for a little
bit because I bought these plastic 3d

95
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,640
puzzle that I loved growing up and I
still love now

96
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:33,050
you guys can take them home with you
play with them here so any question for

97
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:43,699
a few minutes you guys wanna try to
solve this here is the thing up here in

98
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,760
this weather is is basically what it
encodes to see him to look at that and

99
00:10:47,760 --> 00:11:52,550
and so each letter

100
00:11:52,550 --> 00:12:04,140
during getting letters out other things
you can do to get some more on hanging

101
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,449
out of here really cool thing you can do
it you can make us also multi-layered so

102
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:16,529
what will happen is you'll say hello and
you'll do rock 13 on it and then maybe

103
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:22,290
you'll turn that into hexadecimal so now
we've got two layers that when you start

104
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:28,060
with the first time from rock 13 you
don't know exactly or if you started out

105
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,709
small and you solve it looks like the
ones gibberish you're not sure if you're

106
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:36,979
on the right trap and then there's the
fact that layer of turning that into

107
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:59,160
rock 13

108
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:20,290
I think it has a lot to do with private
thing and there's a lot going on right

109
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:20,969
now

110
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,879
privacy and due in part of the tension
between the government and the people

111
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:41,570
and so kind of design of all together
and it's fine

112
00:13:41,570 --> 00:14:02,160
girl don't be afraid if your friends
don't go and do the exact same thing you

113
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,920
are you know teacher friends what you've
learned though probably think it's

114
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:15,079
really cool I think that's no good way
we're already here i mean this is like

115
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:25,250
really awesome so

116
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:36,320
radiologists the math science kind of
guy and so he would invite me to

117
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,050
slaughter in the house and I went to
school that fortunately force you to do

118
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,589
with science fair project every year and
he came up with some really interesting

119
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:52,800
innovative solutions where I think there
was in fourth grade and the I was

120
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,209
anything but science fair project and my
dad wanted to teach basic engineering

121
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:03,220
skills and he's like loves makeup bubble
maker that you know rotates through will

122
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,760
build that other connects and will get
motor and we went to a science store and

123
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,840
i got all the pieces and he helped me
and I think that was you know innovative

124
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:19,710
creative things you know people engage
so how's everyone doing almost

125
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:26,019
everything

126
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:36,989
there so I think the next speaker's was
to come up what i'll do is i'll be over

127
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:42,350
at the TiVo and I'll have my laptop up
so you can take take a look at it or

128
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,759
I'll show you guys where to access this
information so you can help decode and

129
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,759
try to figure this out some good thank
you so much everyone
