1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
we're going to talk a little bit about
you know we talked a lot obviously about

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:09,070
privacy today and the past two days and
there's a lot that you can get you on

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,860
the internet and so berries been doing
some practicing with his computer to go

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,600
out and find find out what you can find
out about other people or yourself on

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,390
Facebook in social media through Google
and I'm gonna show you how to use some

6
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:31,349
more advanced operators in Google that's
called Google Dorking so that you can

7
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,760
then we're gonna go back to the table
here to the computers and you get a

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,390
chance to do little Google Dorking if
you want and I've also got some security

9
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:46,280
dashboards that are that are really cool
so you can talk for a little bit there

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,850
is gonna start off with with his demo so
how many guys out there have Facebook

11
00:00:52,850 --> 00:01:05,290
accounts where your parents are you
friends with your parents on Facebook

12
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:11,560
friends with your parents outside of
Facebook yeah how many of you how many

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:21,369
friends do you have any have 50 friends
hundred friends 200 friends 500 friends

14
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:27,950
you know all of your friends like you
personally aware of every friend you

15
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:35,250
have how many of you join groups and
other things you can have so you might

16
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,780
join your high school alumni group

17
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,560
you might join the community group when
you join a group of friends with

18
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,960
everybody in that group so whether you
know it or not there now being able to

19
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,829
see everything you post unless you make
some security changes so there's some

20
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:57,070
things you can definitely do on Facebook
that I don't know maybe you you want

21
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:03,169
your site to be public so what I've done
as I've setup I have this I call this my

22
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:11,730
alter ego account so it's only has one
friend and the friend is me from this

23
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,209
account I can go into and look at my
account and then see friends of mine

24
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:24,550
that have left their security settings
open so that things are not so private

25
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:32,530
so you want to do with security check up
to make sure you can see my stuff that's

26
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,629
important

27
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:39,959
Facebook used to have a thing called
friends of friends which means anybody I

28
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,550
was friends with anybody they were
friends with could see it they've

29
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,700
removed that any just have public affair
with a click this basically anybody even

30
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,649
if you don't have a Facebook account can
see what I've posted here this account

31
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:06,110
because I want to keep it as private as
possible I change the security settings

32
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:12,070
so that I'm the only person you'll
notice this I allow friends of friends

33
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:19,390
to contact me but not very much else can
go on who can look me up I might not

34
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:25,390
wanna let anybody look me up there are
other places in here in time line in

35
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,049
tagging so I only want to be the only
person posting on my timeline I know

36
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:34,290
other people that are fairly private
about that the only downside to changing

37
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,989
miss the like this is that nobody can
send you a birthday greeting if you have

38
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:44,600
your birthday on there there is some
private information that might you might

39
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:50,170
think is good to have in your profile
but is also something that people can

40
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:57,570
use if they have access to your Facebook
account to be able to fish you or entrap

41
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,760
you to get other information for a while
you could obtain your social security

42
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,790
number just by figuring out where you
were born and what your birthday was

43
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:13,940
that's a little bit more difficult now
but was the case so just a few things on

44
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,149
Facebook to try and make sure you know
you might wanna change who you allowed

45
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:23,229
to see your posts especially let's say
you have some messages you only want to

46
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:29,659
send to certain people you can go down
here and you can customize which friends

47
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:35,979
you know what friends to do that I only
want this guy to see this do you have a

48
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:42,830
list of friends or you could say I don't
want to share with this guy but I want

49
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:47,300
to share with all my other friends so
that's sort of the inverse in this case

50
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,180
it's kind of redundant cause I only have
one friend he's not a very popular guy

51
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:58,020
so its Facebook obviously the the one
thing about any other social media is

52
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:04,409
what what are you posting you might
wanna have fun sometimes and post

53
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,660
strange photos but there are ways of
people finding these things out and as

54
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:14,090
you get older that can hurt you in your
professional life not just from the

55
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,039
standpoint of somebody

56
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:23,350
publicizing photos that are shall we say
indiscreet or I know this sex thing is a

57
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,880
big problem right now you don't want to
post things like that any kind of social

58
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:35,800
media so how many does have an Instagram
account and if you look here

59
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,660
Instagram looks like I need to log in to
see it you don't unless you change the

60
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:49,200
privacy setting so if you know the name
of Instagram account you can just go

61
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,840
there and see all the photos and
everything that's posted from that

62
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,500
account I chose music that's my son's
account he works for Instagram

63
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,020
same thing is true of twitter twitter is
a little bit harder I mean you can

64
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:11,169
search Twitter in other locations but if
you know the name of somebody there's my

65
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:22,860
Twitter account and stuff that I've
posted and here's one for her roots

66
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:33,620
meu snapchat how many of you use an app
to send photos that you didn't want to

67
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,469
be public

68
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:41,439
you really wouldn't want somebody to see
if you do that do you really trust that

69
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:47,219
snap chats deleted the stuff on the back
and there were some hacks and snapchat

70
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:53,539
that allowed them to do some pretty evil
things so in any social media you

71
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:58,960
basically want to think about it and say
what I post this and where this as a

72
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,779
photo on my person and walk around the
streets are in my school if you don't

73
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:09,699
want to do that and probably not a good
idea to send it anywhere

74
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:14,960
things get recorded though if you're
using wicker those things do get

75
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:22,628
destroyed so I'd recommend using man
John here they can come up and talk

76
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:36,930
about Google and the things that they
can do on Google from their phone up

77
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:47,600
here are great so thank you barry where
do we have

78
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:55,620
Facebook alright so you also can trust
everybody that you think you're talking

79
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,590
to online is who they say they are right

80
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:08,310
oh this looks like a kid another school
it might not be so let me just let me

81
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:17,400
check HERE oh this looks like a nice kid
this is my dog and and so if you're if

82
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,890
you're not a friend you can still see
pictures he's awesome he also has a

83
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,539
Facebook account

84
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:31,180
he's only five but I figured you know he
was safe because he doesn't post alot so

85
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:38,750
so yeah you really do need to be careful
let me go over here to Google I wanted

86
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:44,190
to talk about Google everybody knows
what Google is ever used Google you've

87
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,880
used it or at least have used it maybe
it's not your favor

88
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,400
there are there other search engines
some search engines don't keep records I

89
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:58,130
think there's a search engine called
Duck Duck Go that you can google and it

90
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:06,240
will offer it doesn't keep records but
you know Google and Yahoo there were a

91
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,720
whole bunch of search engines a lot of
them are uneven around anymore from the

92
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,390
late nineties and early two thousands
and some are more successful Google's

93
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:21,490
probably the most successful in the
world and they don't charge you can get

94
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,880
email right

95
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:30,100
Gmail Gmail Gmail and it's free right
you go out and you search you know what

96
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,770
they do is they have that search engines
to basically go read every webpage all

97
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:41,010
the code on the web page even the stuff
that you as a viewer don't see and the

98
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:47,030
index all that in a huge database they
have they have so many servers that they

99
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:54,689
have to have really huge warehouses like
many football fields in size and lots of

100
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,320
air conditioners because it gets hot

101
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:04,960
in a really really a lot of the index
the whole internet in so how do they

102
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,390
make money why why is Google just give
this away for free

103
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:15,439
well they don't they look at where you
go on the internet and they build up a

104
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,590
profile and they sell that information
to other companies following their you

105
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:26,900
know their privacy

106
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:32,959
the User Agreement that you can go
online and read but basically they have

107
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,300
a lot of right that's where they make
their money and when you look when you

108
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,979
go to a web page you'll see on the side
let's go search for something let's

109
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:50,300
search for DEFCON if if I go search for
something of this is probably this is

110
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,109
someone's to cure because you don't see
any ads over here so if you're using ad

111
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,230
blocker you're not getting those Google
ads but any ad that you have that pops

112
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,800
up the company that provided the ad then
also knows that you're going to that

113
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,500
page and what you're doing so anyhow
they make a lot of money off of

114
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:16,980
marketing and sometimes there's a story
about a young lady who was in college

115
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:24,490
and she was going to have a baby but she
didn't tell her family that she was she

116
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:30,520
was gonna have a baby and all the sudden
there's advertising in the mailbox start

117
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:35,210
to come to your house because Google
knew what she was going and looking at

118
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:40,120
you know I want to buy baby clothes and
I want to get a you know things for the

119
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,580
nursery and so her father got email or
got mail in the mailbox outside there

120
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:54,480
was actual mail that was for all kinds
of baby stuff right and so you know that

121
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,800
they know what's going on even when the
rest of the family or maybe even the

122
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
girl herself wouldn't

123
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:08,319
known but Google new so it's kind of
it's kind of scary so when you search on

124
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,610
Google you can make your researchers
more advanced and that's what we're

125
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:21,959
going to talk about you can use advanced
operators it's basically an operator

126
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:28,260
I'll show you what that is followed by a
keyword a colon and a keyword and these

127
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:35,540
keywords are called Google dorks ok and
advanced advanced googling is also

128
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:42,510
called Google Dorking so if you want to
learn more about Google Dorking you

129
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:53,220
might just take that in ok let's go

130
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:59,250
Google Dorking

131
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:07,019
we might get better results if if we're
searching for something sometimes Google

132
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:13,110
wants to interpret what Google thinks
you want to search for and so let's

133
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:18,750
let's use all use my example so let's
say I'm going out to find me obviously I

134
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,009
have to put a last name because there's
lots of jobs will I don't think any of

135
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:26,829
these guys look like me so obviously
there are lots of John Johnson's and I

136
00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:33,489
don't have the I'm not as well known as
the gentleman on the left for was the

137
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,379
publisher and founder of Jet magazine he
passed away a couple years ago but he's

138
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:45,660
Johnny Johnson and so maybe I need to
put my middle initial in here

139
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:53,300
ok well I've never been a general let's
let's look over look at images

140
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,550
well there happens to be a very
well-known general ok I am on their butt

141
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:04,469
and then there is a Johnny Johnson
Bulldog right there's a whole brand of

142
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,449
dog called Johnny Johnson Bulldogs and
that's not me either I'm not the another

143
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:19,180
old guy or the dog ok so so let's see if
you want to be more precise and not have

144
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,638
Google guess what you're looking at you
can put quotes around the terms ok so

145
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:28,110
let me put dr. John D Johnson and what
comes up

146
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:35,329
oh well I'm not a fan of spying Dr ok I
don't work on neurosurgery so so this

147
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:40,479
isn't me so now maybe I need to put in
another keyword so let's put in security

148
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:53,559
you can see my my Twitter my website my
my slide decks my my blog all kinds of

149
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,319
information and hopefully if we go over
here

150
00:14:56,319 --> 00:15:01,459
yes there's actually some pictures of me
and that is a cartoonist me but that was

151
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:03,430
back when they had a

152
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:10,719
Simpsons cartoon generator alright so so
you can narrow your search

153
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,520
let's go back to your web and let's say
you want to find something else though

154
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:21,000
ok so so I'm gonna use one of these
Google dorks and I'm gonna go out and

155
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,110
search for something more specific so
let's say I want to go to search the

156
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:34,440
roots website so I type in sight and I
put colon and then I put our 00 T C dot

157
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:42,089
org and maybe I wanna get contact
information right so I'll see contact is

158
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:46,660
going to search the route site so now I
if I taped contacts I get top contact

159
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,350
information from dozens hundreds
thousands of sites rather like a hundred

160
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:56,580
thousand or a million results now typing
in here I get 29 results and the first

161
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:02,190
one is how to contact roots asylum ok so
you can use this advanced these advanced

162
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,740
Google dorks to be more specific so I'll
show you one more example and then we'll

163
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,620
go back over here to the table with the
computers and if you want to do some

164
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,220
Google Dorking I can give you some
information or you can do it later if

165
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,040
you want

166
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,410
so let's try one more let's say I want
to go out and i wanna look for a

167
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:31,600
particular type of file so I can say i'm
looking for file type of XLS that's a

168
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,620
spreadsheet and I want that that's a
spreadsheet to contain

169
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:45,690
type in text call in I want them to have
AT gmail spell that right dot com

170
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,870
although I don't spell it right Google
probably correct it as it thinks it

171
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:57,640
knows what I want and so what do you
think's gonna show up here through Gmail

172
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,910
addresses that somebody has a
spreadsheet who would keep gmail address

173
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:08,389
is in a spreadsheet maybe a company or
organization so let's see what we get

174
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:13,970
wow we've got a hundred and forty-two
thousand results of spreadsheets that

175
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,689
contain people's email

176
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:21,049
alles ok this is how you get on spam
mailing list because companies go out on

177
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:27,720
a farm this and they then they send you
spam and you get a lot of junk mail

178
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,649
okay so that's just one example and I've
got a website that actually will walk

179
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:36,689
you through this so if you want to

180
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,139
we've got a table back here with half a
dozen computers and there's more where

181
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:45,399
the crypto challenge was yesterday I'd
be glad to help you

182
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:52,709
we've got another 10 minutes before the
next speaker and then you can take this

183
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:59,379
information and practice on your own so
anything else barry no I think we're

184
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,110
good thank you very much
