1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,509
think you're coming to go over something
the device built in the Trackmaster

2
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:21,289
combinations so you can actually 3d
printed Arduino and a couple of most oh

3
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:28,650
ok sorry so that probably think you can
3d prints you can use Arduino and a

4
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,829
couple of motives and together we can
take a master combination lock master

5
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:38,360
companies like what it inside the device
and the device will crack it for you so

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:48,840
you look a little video here and you can
also bring everything on you to you will

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:58,739
see it in just a second

8
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:10,880
and does some 200 but I can't explain
this in order so that any anyone can

9
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,820
also build it and actually improve upon
it will start with sort of how it'll

10
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:26,710
work there was nothing but nice combo
that everything's ok so nobly at three

11
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:34,408
different interests are you interested
in returning to a certain number and

12
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:41,110
then to the right of this we did it
because there's three there's three

13
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,630
numbers you have to enter that meanders
forty times forty times 46,000

14
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,869
possibility if you were to you get this
now how to do this because a long time

15
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:54,939
ago they discovered that you can
actually reduce the number of

16
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:58,889
combinations from 64,000 down to a
hundred

17
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,940
how they did that

18
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,230
without is that if you list the shock
call-up you end up getting the

19
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:08,810
combinations I'll pass this around see
we can all see what happens when you let

20
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,250
the shock when you get the nomination
sup what's happening in getting stuck in

21
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,250
some room inside the device another
thing I did hear

22
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,100
driven this thing open

23
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,390
actually see what's inside their
combinations

24
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:32,480
understand how inside because I don't
understand how to get out so coming up

25
00:02:32,480 --> 00:03:16,579
here and actually around seven check it
out

26
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:55,170
so we can all see about a little better
here

27
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:06,369
looking at now is when you turn it
you're getting swept in these groups and

28
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:16,250
these groups are so whenever you're
turning the dial 320 this will all be

29
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:25,860
here inside and there's these little
girls that you can see now what is this

30
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,250
thing is only one of these rules is the
actual that I hope there is the number

31
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:40,729
that we want we want back to base we
match up so that was awkward can be set

32
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:48,229
free but the problem is that I feel I
can feel the groove internet someone

33
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:53,820
with your group in some more appealing
and you're one hell of it is something

34
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,810
unique about this one big group when
you're feeling it if it's slightly wider

35
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,100
than all the other rules that actually
if you're pulling the striking out here

36
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,180
trying to go maybe about half hour at a
number between five and six for example

37
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:14,419
the ones you have the right group you
actually be about a full member number

38
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:19,950
of rotation that means you have a bigger
group and that is related to the number

39
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,599
so once you feel that you actually just
learned with a full third number is that

40
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,590
the BBC over 64,000 possibilities to

41
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:42,989
200 another issue I found this is that
these are you spending the inside it's

42
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:49,070
actually true it's rotating these days
is 150 CDs to also have these groups in

43
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:54,200
here and it's why is your thing about
this is that the number is this your

44
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,110
number as you turn one and then stopped
and turned the other way it then turns

45
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:05,350
the next disc and then he turned the
third time's the next closest we can

46
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:11,370
also feel for the first is also growing
up the sake but only half way and I'll

47
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:19,470
actually probably the wrong

48
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:35,720
everything and that's a combination lock
out there

49
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:43,160
so if you look at the way you get
stopped but about only half way and you

50
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,640
turn it before rotation every time you
turn up with resistance at the same

51
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,539
place if you're not being there was this
did you can adjust the shock of how much

52
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,080
for letting the shocking me wonder about
halfway and then turn and I feel

53
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:06,630
insistence around 1500 you get all that
resistance as you turn it clockwise you

54
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:12,130
feel just a little boy accused of
killing his European thing internal

55
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:19,250
mechanism in this one up against bill of
this group now gonna doing that this is

56
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:28,130
the first combination this by doing that
lately off from this time period that

57
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,620
means you're five digits away from here
when you're heading to hear that actual

58
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:39,200
number is 520 whatever number you hit
your resistance so if you add five

59
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,340
that's your first number so now you
never went into their number and you

60
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:49,760
have only three digit left and then as a
mathematical correlation between all of

61
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,460
these

62
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:58,219
between the second and the first thing
because the only at certain points as

63
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:04,260
you're rooting that I want you to all
our clock wise woman shackled not a

64
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:10,210
layup if you get stuck in your head that
seat in both it at least 36 degree or

65
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:15,310
you know around what they feel
resistance and once you go on systems at

66
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:30,520
fifteen when you're holding it right and
you just found the first number

67
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:57,020
printing of remodeling and hardware
hardly a key step by step and start to

68
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,670
finish on global building is part of it
so you can actually build your own I

69
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:07,370
have another simply wasn't here is one
of its power till you can just see just

70
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:14,600
murdered in action let's play it in here
and I teach you how to get this stuff so

71
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:26,710
you can just like a video game

72
00:09:26,710 --> 00:10:04,170
but in general to try to teach them
basic reverse engineering and consulting

73
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,599
for this kind of stuff such as
incredible as you know I know all you

74
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,530
can really contribute to this kind of
stuff you guys can help buildings

75
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:19,610
ratings happenings in it so much so much
more that can be done so if if any of

76
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:24,580
you have insisted no please email me you
know what the video is common in the

77
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,870
videos I always respond to any kind of
stuff that you want to learn I got to be

78
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,150
able to help steer that I've learned a
lot from other people when I was younger

79
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:40,930
I would like to see if if I can help
other people and at some point so I'd

80
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:50,170
love that questions

81
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:58,939
the blinding light ok that's it

82
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:10,320
I i GTG I did the GMR sorry you had jim
yes we live in two weeks ago

83
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:17,840
options are and it's it's a device that
allows you to any car has also promoting

84
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:26,280
on Saturday answered a couple things
that lets a user to lock your car remote

85
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:36,750
sites 2001 on the alarms I think I have
a quick video about to attack my plans

86
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:42,570
remotely he gave me permission and it
would actually drop it off and then we

87
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:51,410
both started here again the web and
there's is there's the walk in his car

88
00:11:51,410 --> 00:12:03,260
is the 2013 Chevy Volt modified in any
way that you can actually understand his

89
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:09,020
car and use the Raspberry Pi computers
inexpensive $35 computer takes on a used

90
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:14,380
a wifi part actually to wifi card and
what the wife of one of the wifi card is

91
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,030
absolutely nothing for mobile phones

92
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:20,730
person goes into their car your mobile
phone is sending all these things called

93
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,870
Probert West thing hey what's your

94
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:31,560
is my home network you raise my you know
other WiFi network here and it will my

95
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,829
phone my home network at home a little
house so whenever my phone goes anyway

96
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:41,610
says hey the house here the box detects
that the text that I created and it

97
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,370
creates a network called called our
house so pretend to be the network of my

98
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,770
house that make the persons phone will
be on the car jump on my wifi network

99
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,800
from there I see intercepted traffic was
your man in the middle of the pack and i

100
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,339
intercept all the traffic from the phone
and from there because of something

101
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:03,689
incorrect photography in the apt to be
able to see the username and password

102
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:09,680
for the user actually open be out for
the first time I don't have any time I

103
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,138
can open the app I can locate their car
I've lost it and then remote start and

104
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:21,459
do whatever I want to their car at any
point in the future I immediately let

105
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:26,319
GMN author knows they can fix it within
about a week I never really I had a

106
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:29,259
really source code until they actually
fix the problem

107
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:34,160
pretty quick to fix it and buy a week
later they fix the phone sorry about so

108
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,089
I probably got new app updates for free

109
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:43,309
the problem was fixed and then I talked
about it yesterday and I did a little

110
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:48,980
video on my YouTube as well on that
we're a go into more detail and that's

111
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:57,430
that's the GI tract any other questions

112
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:03,859
it's called I'm really bad at you
thinking how you work so I applied as

113
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:10,380
they attempt are you can if you just
want to see me campaigner YouTube video

114
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:17,380
find it but my website to meet up to
yell as a reminder to yell and I have a

115
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:23,380
link to be over YouTube right on there
any answer all comments any questions on

116
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,620
there so i really wanna see that the
people in and hope and learn from other

117
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,589
people's questions
