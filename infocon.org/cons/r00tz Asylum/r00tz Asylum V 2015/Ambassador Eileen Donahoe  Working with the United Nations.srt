1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,310
hello everybody my name is Eileen
Donahoe and Nico asked me to come speak

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:13,480
to you about the united nations or the
UN

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,610
and I i guess my personal connection let
me start their my personal connection to

4
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:24,689
the united nations which I will tell you
about the entity itself with that I was

5
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:31,640
the you s ambassador to the UN Human
Rights Council in Geneva for four years

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:39,170
from 2010 through 2013 and I now work at
a human rights organization called human

7
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:45,350
rights watch as the director of global
affairs and we basically try to put

8
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,789
pressure and scrutiny on the governments
throughout the world to live up to their

9
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:58,160
commitments that they've made through
the UN system that's my connection I

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,739
went out and talked a little bit about
the connection between routes and the UN

11
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:10,640
and let me let me first half of the kids
who are here in the audience anybody you

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:18,110
know 15 16 or younger have you heard of
the United Nations has anybody heard of

13
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,259
the united nations they've heard of one
person who was actually sixteen year old

14
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,090
and said I think I've heard of the
United Nations so let me start by saying

15
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:34,910
the united nations have some one
important thing very much in common with

16
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:43,199
roots roots was founded with this idea
that you're trying to make the world a

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,340
better place and create a better world
and I thought I understand it this whole

18
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:56,399
project is to try to empower all of you
to understand your power and

19
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,170
responsibility to make the world a
better place and in many ways that's

20
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:08,280
what the UN was also founded for and
interestingly the reason I decided to

21
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,530
put this slide back up which was
something that sci-fi and Christina head

22
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,849
up at the very top of the program

23
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:19,179
these are these are they actually this
is

24
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,519
it's the way it's the one before this is
these are the rules but you don't have

25
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:28,069
to drive the changes lied I will tell
you I'm interested in the principles the

26
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:33,708
principles behind the founding those are
the values you get it even before the

27
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:40,269
rules values are laughing at the first
that's it ok if you look at those by

28
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:46,269
Principal the same principles apply at
the UN in fact the united nation was

29
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:52,109
founded on the concept that the world is
one we're all connected these

30
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:56,480
connections are growing stronger and
faster every day and that has been true

31
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,450
since the founding of the UN chaos
control the connection focus control the

32
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:09,918
chaos and you control the focus so I'm
gonna tell you how these things apply to

33
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:16,129
the UN now so the UN United Nations was
founded seventy years ago way before the

34
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:24,548
internet existed and it was founded in
the aftermath of World War Two where you

35
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:29,560
know over 60 countries around the world
hadn't been engaged in a multiple year

36
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:37,510
war that covered much of the globe
millions of people were killed and much

37
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:43,548
of the planet experienced physical
devastation and that devastation was

38
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:50,689
enough to get the leaders of the world
to say ok this is not acceptable

39
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:56,959
we've gotta figure out a way to solve
problems without going to war so the

40
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,849
original idea was that each government
in the world would come together at the

41
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:06,439
united nations they would send a
representative and that those

42
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:11,709
representatives of their governments
would sit down and and and solve

43
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:20,620
problems without you know fighting in a
physical military way today there are a

44
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,800
hundred and ninety three government

45
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,490
that are part of the UN and the original
organization of the UN had three parts

46
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:36,770
one part was the protection of
international peace and security

47
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:44,180
basically preventing war second part was
economic development and alleviating

48
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:50,289
poverty because everybody understood
poverty was a big driver of conflict

49
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:55,919
third part this is part I really care
about is the protection of human rights

50
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:03,979
and the idea that individual individual
people by virtue of being a human being

51
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:10,639
have certain inalienable rights the
rights don't come because the government

52
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,840
gave you the rights you've got them
government's job is to protect and

53
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,469
promote the freedoms and rights of their
own citizens so those were the founding

54
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:24,229
ideas

55
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:31,190
the other very interesting piece of this
is that at the time they were the

56
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:37,469
understanding that governments
controlled physical territory and that

57
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:42,990
each government was responsible for the
security inside the geographic physical

58
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,580
boundaries of that territory and they
responsible to the people within that

59
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:53,810
territory citizens so what happened the
internet came and have completely

60
00:05:53,810 --> 00:06:00,330
disrupted this entire system in certain
very challenging ways the internet

61
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,279
doesn't really recognized geographical
boundaries as particularly important you

62
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,719
can communicate with people anywhere on
the planet and governments don't really

63
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:16,659
control that ability necessarily part of
what's happened is that a lot of power

64
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:24,009
has been distributed from government to
private sector technology companies as

65
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:32,029
well as to individual hackers are
incredibly empowered be the be all kinds

66
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:35,520
of entities in the world in particular
other

67
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,789
events and there is this sort of new
power dynamic

68
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:44,479
what we call a symmetry it used to be
you have one government against another

69
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,969
government or multiple governments
fighting against each other but at least

70
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:53,860
you sort of knew who your enemies were
and what their abilities were and you

71
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,419
knew how to think about protection and
when you do you know make a deal

72
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:04,198
currently governments are so much more
vulnerable because individual hackers or

73
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:12,470
peak people anywhere can disrupt their
societies and caused massive damage so

74
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:23,750
and I want to connect what you what you
guys are all doing with the three big

75
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:29,659
project that the us- was formed for the
let you start with that first one

76
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:38,440
international peace and security people
being trained here could play an amazing

77
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:46,919
role in helping government as well as
private sector entities as well as

78
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:53,948
individual citizens around the globe to
protect themselves in terms of their

79
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:58,680
digital security and in particular
protection of critical infrastructure

80
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,779
because now the concept of war but
everybody's focused on now and the

81
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:10,620
biggest threat everybody's worried about
is cyber warfare and what's really

82
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,020
challenging about cyber warfare is it's
difficult it's called an attribution

83
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:20,029
problem it's difficult to know who your
attacker is and so the importance of

84
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:24,099
protection of your critical
infrastructure becomes so important

85
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:30,650
because you you you can't necessarily
deter the bad actors with your own

86
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:35,468
physical overwhelming power as you could
have in the in the previous age you can

87
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:39,750
be attacked from anywhere and it's
difficult to know even who go after so

88
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,458
cybersecurity for critical
infrastructure is something you up you

89
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:48,010
all could be working on the second big
pillar of the UN

90
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:54,640
is the one about economic development
and want you to think about this there

91
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:03,660
are 7 billion people in the world of
those seven billion four billion more

92
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,930
than half do not have connection to the
Internet

93
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:13,839
they do not have access to information
communication technology digital

94
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:19,050
technology and therefore all of the
resources and information that you

95
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24,420
experience in your life because of those
connections are completely lacking for

96
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,699
just try to imagine what would it be
like to live if you didn't have access

97
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:35,630
to digital technology and the internet
so that the second big bucket where you

98
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:44,189
could put your skills to work if it is
enhancing or or exponentially expanding

99
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:50,120
the access to information communication
technology that's the second big UN

100
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,820
project you could really help the third
one that I really care about is the

101
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:04,580
protection and promotion of human rights
and hear the Internet has in some ways

102
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:12,030
been incredible boon to the exercise of
human rights in effect the Internet has

103
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,819
become the landscape on which people
actually exercise all their freedoms

104
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,630
freedom to access information people
freedom to share information

105
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,430
freedom to communicate what they think
form their opinions

106
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,339
share their opinions and communicate
with people around the world also that

107
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:35,440
means by which people organize
themselves for any kind of project that

108
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,580
they're engaged in for social good it's
done via the internet and that's called

109
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:46,310
freedom of assembly and association but
access to information

110
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,410
ability to communicate that's freedom of
expression fundamental right

111
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,439
freedom of assembly and association how
you organize yourselves is done

112
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,910
essentially on the Internet at this
point and it's done globally people can

113
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,370
connect with each other all over the

114
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:07,779
world so that that's the upside down
side of the internet or digital

115
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:12,860
technology and information communication
technology is that it's also empowered

116
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:20,440
government in certain ways that
completely undermines human rights so on

117
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,170
the one hand you have a repressive
government that basically monitor and

118
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:33,459
track everything their citizens do and I
can tell you that if you knew that

119
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:38,089
everything you were doing at every
minute ago said you know cameras in your

120
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:39,720
hotel room

121
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,260
everywhere you win by your government it
would obviously have massively what we

122
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,900
think chilling effect on your exercise
of your freedom would be less likely to

123
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,660
say what you think out loud you'd be
less likely to meet with people who you

124
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,620
thought you might put at risk

125
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:07,040
you just constrained by virtue of not
having their privacy enhance the ability

126
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:15,360
to do mass surveillance of everybody
with the digitization of everything so

127
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:23,490
what I would say is that the part of
human rights protection and promotion

128
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:33,070
that you all could really help with is a
digital security for individuals and

129
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:39,190
helping governments understand that the
way they actually protect their national

130
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:45,410
security is my understanding the digital
security of all of their citizens as

131
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,819
individuals the digital security of
everybody's data their health data their

132
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,200
banking records you know there's search
records all of it is that is an aspect

133
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:03,529
of security that is not antithetical or
against national security it's actually

134
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:06,130
the means through which you achieve

135
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:12,000
leave your national security the other
thing and I think you all work in this

136
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,670
space and you're enhancing digital
security

137
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:19,890
gotta advocate for the importance of
that digital security to your

138
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:29,840
government's the other big piece of it
is just plain advancing the idea that

139
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:38,230
privacy itself is a right it's a human
right its international universal human

140
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:45,540
rights that every individual should have
and in many places in many government

141
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:53,110
conversations it's not well understood
and it's not valued adequately but the

142
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:59,480
basic idea is that you you cannot
exercise any of your other rights or

143
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:07,710
other fundamental freedom freedom to
form opinions to collect information to

144
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:13,390
share your opinions expressed yourself
to have meetings freedom of movement

145
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:19,030
freedom of assembly and association none
of those things are really possible or

146
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:24,850
fully possible if you have no zone of
privacy because as I said every if

147
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:29,470
everything you do is being tracked and
monitored and watch your not gonna feel

148
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,660
empowered to exercise what you would
your right to do what you would

149
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:39,480
otherwise do and I believe your
generation and all of you in this

150
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:46,550
program are so far ahead of the curve in
understanding the value of privacy and

151
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:51,969
part of your job is not just the
technical dimension it as advocates out

152
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:58,220
in the world for the importance of
privacy to all of your freedom and and

153
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:04,650
by the way to your security to the
security of your country to national

154
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,209
security

155
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,780
to international peace and security
we've got to start with the protection

156
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:15,329
of privacy so let me stop there though
those are the basics about the UN and

157
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,520
how closely

158
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:22,220
it relates to the work of love you all
of you were doing and there's a space

159
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,660
for you to help with

160
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,069
in the international peace and security
cyber protecting critical infrastructure

161
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:32,580
with cybersecurity helping connect the
world to the internet but most

162
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:39,010
importantly advocating for privacy as
the core the essential piece of being

163
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:45,230
able to exercise human rights anywhere
so I don't have any questions you want

164
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,700
to ask anything

165
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,400
ok that's it
