1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:09,550
very very nice to be here been here with
DEFCON kids and then routes over its

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:15,170
existence and it's it's always been very
inspiring to see that the people here

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,109
trying to learn how to hack had to be
white hat hackers and how to sort of

4
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,210
make the world a better place and that's
a little bit of also we're trying to do

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,999
with the Electronic Frontier Foundation
so my organization is a non-profit civil

6
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:31,359
liberties organization dedicated to
defending your rights online trying to

7
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,570
make the world safe for privacy for
freedom of expression so give people the

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:43,340
freedom to tinker to play one of the
areas where this comes most relevant for

9
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,450
for this crowd is our coders rights
project and we're trying to defend

10
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:55,010
people's right to to code this is
actually a large part of what if

11
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:01,199
afternoon for many years one of our
early cases was establishing that code

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,400
is speech that it is something that is
protected by the First Amendment

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,770
something that is a way of expressing
yourself and this came about in the in

14
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,960
the late nineties when there were some
regulations about exporting crypto

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,889
encryption technologies and a professor
wanted to publish on the web

16
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,180
a encryption program called snuffle and
by publishing and making it widely

17
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,510
available that came into conflict with
these laws that were originally designed

18
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:36,030
for munitions or or trying to control
exports of weapons technology and so we

19
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,880
went to the court and were able to
establish that by publishing this that

20
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,630
was a speech act and the encryption
could be shared

21
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,830
even if they thought that it would be
equipped I wanted to talk to you a

22
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:54,580
little bit about what whitehat hacking
to to borrow a phrase from from

23
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:01,670
Spiderman with great power comes great
responsibility and so they over the next

24
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,189
couple of days a lot of you will be
learning how to how to do some pretty

25
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:11,380
amazing things how to pick locks how to
sniff packets and how to operate with

26
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,170
technologies in ways those technologies
were not intend

27
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,660
and that sort of the core of what what
hacking is about is make sure that when

28
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,280
you have a thing when you have a device
and environment it's not just as it is

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,260
given to you that you have to accept a
block black box and let somebody else

30
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,810
determine what you can do with it but
instead you can find new and creative

31
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,130
ways to make it something different make
it something better figure out how it

32
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,170
works take it apart put it back together
again sometimes in the same way

33
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,380
sometimes in a different way and these
are very powerful tools but also you

34
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,230
should be using the responsibly and
Reuters put up at the honor code here

35
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,980
that's a that's a good start

36
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:59,109
one of one of the aspects of that is to
avoid trouble with the law so few brief

37
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,780
brief words about where where some of
that can come into play the main federal

38
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,940
Andy hacking laws called the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act it comes into play

39
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:16,290
if you're accessing something without
authorization and so something to a part

40
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,410
of why it's useful to have their own
devices or come to an environment here

41
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:25,850
where people are providing things with
permission for you to hack and then if

42
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:32,260
you want to hack something that you
don't go pick it up like so because

43
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,500
mentoring there there are ATMs that are
available on eBay so if you want to

44
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,130
learn how to hack an ATM take that apart
go buy one and even a and start acting

45
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,459
on it rather than doing one which is
live and filled with other people's

46
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:53,450
money and other laws the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act this is this

47
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,250
something you'll hear a little bit more
about tomorrow when cory has been talked

48
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,970
about digital rights management

49
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:05,100
it is a law designed to make it more
difficult to break copyright protection

50
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,459
schemes things that are trying to make
it difficult to copy music and songs and

51
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,470
movie ends the

52
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:18,730
content industry the movie and recording
industries were concerned that they

53
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:24,800
weren't as good at securing hackers were
attacking so rather than improve their

54
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,980
security and make better technology they
sought instead they would go to congress

55
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,530
in me hehe legal to break their
technology and so they create a special

56
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,239
law that it does have some exemptions
for encryption research for security

57
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,120
research but if you are going to be
hacking in those areas that is another

58
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,610
time where it's good to get some some
counsel from an attorney and other

59
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,970
things to think about when you're when
you're acting up things even if it is

60
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:54,220
your own thing it may have come with a
user license agreement terms of service

61
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,080
some sort of contractual document that
limits what you would otherwise be able

62
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,659
to do and I know you see these things
probably click through them fairly

63
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:07,550
frequently me not read all the way to
the end and they will often have terms

64
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,910
the train restrict what you were you
were doing so sometimes if you want

65
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,010
something get it from a different
directions were just talking about

66
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:19,289
buying something on ebay to use that
example of of the ATM if you got it from

67
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,310
the original manufacturer and probably
would have some terms and deals and

68
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,060
contracts associated with it that would
limit what you can do but if you buy it

69
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,460
secondhand usually get it without a
contract whatsoever and then be able to

70
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:42,260
your your cool hacking into contracts
like you I was you may end up in

71
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,310
situations where you have a
non-disclosure agreement things that

72
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,640
will restrict what you can say and
sometimes this can be a very good thing

73
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,740
if you're if you're working with the
company and they would like to see how

74
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,120
the vendor would like to see what could
be done to their advice how it can be

75
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,190
hacked but they they would like to work
with you and say ok let's do it in da

76
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:08,270
and to promote your disclosure to them
and then they can go tell the world I'm

77
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,820
so one of the things that we do in our
in our code is right project is we will

78
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,729
basically two types of things one is to
talk to people before they're doing the

79
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:19,630
research and how to conduct it safely
and that some of the tips I was just

80
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,550
talking to you

81
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:26,030
about another is to advise people on how
they they presented and how to report

82
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,080
the vulnerability some of that is just
in in having conversations with with

83
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:37,500
vendors unfortunately some are not cool
about having having the world know that

84
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,610
there are security problems with their
product they rather people live in

85
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,090
ignorance and still buy the product even
though it's flawed rather than take the

86
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,049
time to actually improve it patch it and
get it fixed

87
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,650
nevertheless you're generally reporting
to the vendor giving them an opportunity

88
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,049
to to get it fixed

89
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,770
is is a better way to go but sometimes
if they're unwilling to fix it and

90
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,549
people need to know about the floor full
disclosure can be appropriate so that

91
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:09,800
the public can do about it and those
cases you might get legal threats this

92
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,830
another time where where it's useful to
check with a lawyer and then there's

93
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:20,200
another circumstance which is leaving a
little bit more more heady but when in

94
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,250
the course of the research someone may
have gotten very close to a line or gone

95
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:29,230
perhaps even beyond aid in doing the
research and it creates a interesting

96
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:34,280
tension where if by talking about it you
may end up admitting something that

97
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,200
could be used against you but by not
talking about it

98
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,370
the flawed product continues to be out
there and probably someone else can

99
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,300
figure out what the Flyers and do bad
things with it so that's another

100
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,260
circumstance where it's good to check in
with with an attorney to try and figure

101
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,050
out how to get that information to the
public so that the products can get

102
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,540
fixed so you can make the world a better
place while not overly endanger yourself

103
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:05,490
so that's just a brief brief overview of
some of the things about hacking to to

104
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,230
keep aware of but you should be really
happy to be here because this is a safe

105
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,040
place where you do have the
authorization to hack and the

106
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,070
opportunity and so go to it enjoy all
the things thank you
