1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,559
so it's always awesome to come to roots
the thing though is that it's like how

2
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:13,840
do I talk to a group of people that
range from seven years old to seventy

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,400
years old or or excuse me if some of you
are younger or older or younger at heart

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,759
but ultimately a lot of the folks that
come here or are participating in in

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,280
either routes or at DEFCON many of them
don't have that great a conception of

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,469
the role that they can play or how
important your own role and an

7
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,140
individual in a free society is in what
I'm going to be talking about which is

8
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:47,239
the overall struggle for freedom in the
world I'm here essentially to talk about

9
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:53,149
defeating dictatorships and what does
that mean and again I am sorry if i if i

10
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:56,500
seemed like I'm talking necessarily to
an audience that may either be too young

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,370
or too old for you but we can go with
the flow and I'm always happy to answer

12
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,730
any questions

13
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:07,750
democracy dictatorship there they're
quite long sounding words but what

14
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,820
exactly do they mean they are two words
that describe very different approaches

15
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:19,639
to how a country is governed in a
democracy it is the people who choose

16
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,040
the government it is the people who have
the power

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,420
democracy is a belief that focuses on
people but more important it focuses on

18
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,909
the individual it revolves around you in
a democracy you can take into account

19
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:39,710
what is in your best interests as well
as if you wish what is in everybody's

20
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,130
best interest

21
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,048
democracy gives people the power to have
a voice because it allows you to be

22
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,250
heard it allows you to hear the opinions
of other people but in the end the

23
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,399
crucial aspect of a democracy is that
you have the right and freedom to make

24
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:03,430
your own choices in a democracy you have
the power to choose so you know if you

25
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,680
think of it as you know spider-man you
know with great power comes great

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,420
responsibility in a democracy the
responsibility

27
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,089
starts

28
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,379
with you it means that we take
responsibility for our actions for

29
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:18,910
example when you break certain rules or
laws there are consequences that follow

30
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,440
you can be educated about what's going
on about the world so that you can make

31
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,959
contributions to your own quality of
life or the quality of life of other

32
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,209
people in a democracy you have the
choice to help others if you wish to

33
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:36,650
associate with others to build
businesses and most importantly and most

34
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,810
importantly you get to keep your own
stuff the central and most important

35
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,549
individual right in a democracy is
property rights and what do I mean by

36
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:52,940
that I mean you own your self the
government does not only you throughout

37
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:58,129
history there have been governments that
view you as their property which is for

38
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:02,660
instance why suicide is illegal in so
many countries because they don't view

39
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,170
you as your self they view you as an
aspect of the state something the state

40
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,869
needs to operate usually to make money

41
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,610
the contrast with democracy of course is
a dictatorship where the people have no

42
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:20,030
power a dictator is a ruler that wields
with absolute authority a state that's

43
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:26,120
ruled by a dictator is a dictatorship
the word comes originally at the title

44
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,329
of it was a magistrate in ancient Rome
that was appointed by the Senate in

45
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:34,709
times of emergency this was during the
Roman Republic

46
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:39,000
the dictator would be appointed by the
Senate usually for six months it was

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,900
kind of like a government hack a
dictatorship was like a hack it was

48
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,220
let's give someone absolute authority to
control things and make everything

49
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,319
better for just six months and then
don't fix all the problems and after six

50
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,819
months they will step down we see the
problem is that once people get power

51
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:02,149
they don't want to let it go and so they
chose many dictators that were actually

52
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,450
very good people that did a very good
job and then left after six months but

53
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,720
one of them was like no I kind of like
it here this is kind of cool to quote

54
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,548
lord acton power corrupts and absolute
power corrupts absolutely

55
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:17,810
but

56
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,870
you see in the mind of the dictator it's
a little bit different the way they

57
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:29,070
think is power is delicious and absolute
power is absolutely delicious and so in

58
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,469
the end they ended up with one dictator
you know if you look at Caesars Palace

59
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,950
down the street that was the ultimate
first really bad dictator Julius Caesar

60
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:44,210
who made himself emperor and certainly
made the Republic into an empire and

61
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:50,229
what was the Roman Republic like the
United States it was set up where power

62
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:54,659
is divided against itself with different
branches of government that cold each

63
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,700
other in check so in the USA for
instance the founders an extraordinary

64
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,960
group of remarkable man who had studied
lots and lots of history all of them

65
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,090
were hackers in their own time

66
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:12,880
Madison Jefferson Samuel Adams they set
up this republic and so america's first

67
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,090
president George Washington he held
office for one term and this is

68
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,359
something that is lost on and I'm not an
American I i've learned a lot about the

69
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,100
United States but what's lost a lot of
people is it something remarkable

70
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,120
happened when george washington was
president and that is everyone expected

71
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,200
him to stay as president

72
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,110
forever because he had control of the
united states like a minor and he said

73
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,229
no I'm going to turn over power after
one term and he turned it over to John

74
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:49,400
Adams this singular moment in American
history is a shock wave through the

75
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,450
planet Earth in as much as it
established the best standard for

76
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:58,219
government and so the freedoms we enjoy
today or precisely because of the checks

77
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,700
on government power

78
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,159
democracy isn't about voting people just
think of the voting booth but it's about

79
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,139
everything that protects individual
rights of the people

80
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:13,350
modern democracies divide power into
legislature which makes the law the

81
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:18,130
executive which make sure you obey the
law and the judiciary that will punish

82
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,600
you if you break the law

83
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,760
people in government have to also follow
the law this is something that a lot of

84
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,980
people forget just concerned government
doesn't mean that they're above the law

85
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,200
the other major check of course on on
power is civil society and what's that

86
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,920
this what we're doing right here is
civil society civil society is the

87
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,830
family civil society is the media civil
society are the companies that we buy

88
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,729
things from civil society is everything
that does not involve government and

89
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,500
ultimately it is where the power
actually rests so the freedoms we enjoy

90
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,890
in america some other countries have
these freedoms as well because there are

91
00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:00,789
institutions that allow for a free and
critical action associated and

92
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,910
oftentimes competing individuals and
organizations one group wants one thing

93
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,180
another group wants another thing it's a
messy clash of opinions democracies very

94
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,730
messy and so politicians in democratic
countries are are effectively forced by

95
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,870
this division of power to respect
privacy rights competition private

96
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,770
property freedom of speech freedom of
association and today of course and most

97
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,900
very important Internet freedom so this
culture of freedom and vibrant civil

98
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:35,159
society has transparency privacy
competition and it favors freedom of

99
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,810
expression and it is these same set of
institutions and norms that allow us to

100
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:46,340
have modernity advances in computers the
reason why you know if your child there

101
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,869
are many many toys is because we live in
a free country in countries that are not

102
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,720
free

103
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,880
you will not have a variety and choice
in toys just like your parents won't

104
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:01,219
have a variety and choice and cars
choice is the central word of democracy

105
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,480
along with tolerance the sad reality is
that not all nations of the world live

106
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,330
under governments that allow for
criticism and allow for challenges by

107
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,710
civil society of government or allow
individuals to talk up to government and

108
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:20,190
say I disagree I don't like the
president I disagree with what what the

109
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:25,460
president has done not all governments
allow citizens to associate and to

110
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:31,200
discuss the pros and cons of a
particular law let alone allow people to

111
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,640
campaign or or go on the campaign trail
you been looking on TV about all of

112
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,919
these different candidates for office
and they're all fighting for office

113
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,459
well thats

114
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,480
not allowed in in some countries some
countries would not allowed DEFCON to

115
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,850
happen where they wouldn't allow an
organization like a human rights group

116
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:52,410
to exists so I'm gonna ask those who are
under 15 how many of you know what the

117
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:57,839
population of the United States is go
ahead

118
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,960
excellent three hundred and twenty
minute just for the sake of my curiosity

119
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,920
do you know where the population of
Europe is ok just checking ok ok anyone

120
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:16,839
you're up to 500 million Brazil 200
million get so so this is you know if

121
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,100
you add it all up were talking about
almost a billion people well now imagine

122
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:27,980
the population United States 320 million
now multiply that by ten twelve times

123
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,760
that's how many human beings on this
earth are living under dictatorship

124
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,390
imagine 3.9 billion people

125
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,650
fifty-seven percent of the world's
population currently are living under

126
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:47,199
non democracies of that you know some of
them are fully fledged dictatorships

127
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,710
where there's one guy and power who
doesn't allow anyone to dissent and some

128
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:56,640
of them are sort of dictatorships were
people aren't entirely under shackles

129
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,850
they have a few freedoms here and there
there is one point six billion living

130
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,470
under fully-fledged dictatorships and
these people aren't free they don't

131
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,070
allow they don't allow in these
countries any degree of political

132
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:11,320
participation to criticize the president
you're not allowed to choose the job you

133
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,010
want you're not allowed to choose where
you can live you're not allowed to like

134
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,290
be a newspaper journalist and write an
article you're not allowed to be part of

135
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:25,099
a political party in many cases you're
not even allowed to leave the country if

136
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,690
you don't like it you can't even say I'm
leaving so every time you hear someone

137
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,830
on a playground in america say I don't
want to

138
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:37,120
well why not because it's a free country
that's actually something really

139
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,150
remarkable because it's the exception in
history

140
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:45,220
most of the people on earth are not
living in three countries under under

141
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,780
these standards if you think about it
and you've heard of these countries

142
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,270
Egypt Jordan

143
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:56,920
Pakistan Russia Rwanda turkey Venezuela
these are all countries that are only

144
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,849
partially free to use the internet
people in these countries can't access

145
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:07,370
facebook sometimes or twitter has been
has been censored then you have

146
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,030
countries like that you may also have
heard of like for instance by train or

147
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:20,180
Belarus Burma Iran or Saudi Arabia where
China Tunisia

148
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:26,479
these are places where there's almost no
freedom of the to use the internet so

149
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:35,300
mean how many of you use Wikipedia
Facebook Google Twitter ok so imagine

150
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,810
these countries it's almost fully or
almost fully blocked to be able to use

151
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,650
this on the internet

152
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:46,140
some countries to allow a little bit of
freedom so for instance and China just

153
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:51,310
as it was in the dictatorship of Chile
under pinochet people are allowed to

154
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:57,359
choose in the marketplace of goods in in
in in commerce so you can engage in

155
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,270
commerce they have economic freedom but
they're not allowed to engage in the

156
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:05,110
marketplace of ideas you're not allowed
to dissent have a different idea from

157
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,930
the government so it makes things a
little messy 22 to be able to to to

158
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,420
figure it out but ultimately they're not
a democracy the doors to political

159
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,860
participation and to dissent or shut
down and people get arrested and put in

160
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,810
prison and sent away to concentration
camps if they disagree with the

161
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:30,469
government so this also means ultimately
that a hacker on this is that people in

162
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,960
these dictatorship that they have a cell
phone and can figure out how to use a

163
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,750
VPN or something like that they can stay
up-to-date with their acquaintances

164
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,980
about what's going on in other countries
and this non-political use of cell

165
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,150
phones is what has brought about a
number of revolutions so there are these

166
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:53,050
very very small windows of light that
have allowed voices of human beings

167
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:57,810
living under these non democracies to be
heard by us because they then upload

168
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,489
things to you too and even though their
citizens

169
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:06,430
same country can't watch it on YouTube
we can watch it over here and this is

170
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:12,660
the biggest reason why those of us who
are in three countries should really do

171
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,310
everything we can to help people that
are living under dictatorship and and

172
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:22,029
there are many many ways to do that the
first thing you should do toward this is

173
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:25,100
learn about the world's oppressed
peoples

174
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,450
learn about tibet learn about the system
system of government they have in

175
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:34,529
vietnam learn about Ethiopia and about
Belarus and about cuba and make up your

176
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:39,540
own minds about what's going on in these
countries but doing using standards and

177
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:44,680
not emotions and always it's down to the
basics are individuals allowed to leave

178
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,560
our individuals allowed to have an
opinion are they allowed to criticize

179
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,219
the government it's these simple simple
issues it doesn't require to be a

180
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,240
political scientist or an expert you at
your age can figure out if this is a

181
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,490
good or not a good system now a lot of
people are paid a lot of murdering by

182
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,790
the dictator deseo we have great health
care here so don't worry about the

183
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,300
rights because we have health care and
everything is great here don't don't be

184
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,219
fooled by that it's down to individual
rights in the basics and unfortunately

185
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:21,560
the world looking for instance at Africa
in 1990 only four out of fifty four

186
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:29,189
African countries where democratic for
twenty twenty-five years later it's only

187
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:34,300
15 out of 54 that are democratic and
only 10 of those countries are

188
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,279
democratic successes

189
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:44,880
free media only exist in 10 out of fifty
four African countries and dictators you

190
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,100
should consider they caused most of the
world's problems all of the collapse

191
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,300
states all the countries that are not
functioning and so america has to send

192
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,399
money there or Europe has to send money
there because they have devastated their

193
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,250
economies it's usually because one
ruling family takes all the morning of

194
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,830
so many cases of corruption grand

195
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:11,900
plunder and ultimately the west's
governments have to spend trillions of

196
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,699
dollars cleaning up the mess dictators
unfortunately governments don't

197
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,350
understand the dictators are never
interested in reform we will talk about

198
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,550
it so Obama for instance or his
predecessor Bush would meet with a

199
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,589
dictator and the dictator with I'm gonna
behave better with my people if you give

200
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:33,960
me a few billion dollars so they always
talk about it but then they never

201
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,780
actually do anything there stone death
to reason they're still in debt now the

202
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,120
psychological reasons for why they
behave like that that's that's a topic

203
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,170
for another day but these people are
coming survivors

204
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,870
allergic to reform and they will do
whatever it takes to keep their power

205
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,330
and their well because ultimately the
reason they want power is cuz they want

206
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:02,250
the money so I can give you example
after example of how much money and just

207
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,730
to give you a sense for instance sonny
abacha of Nigeria a country that that

208
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:12,170
has people living under two or three
dollars a day was the leader there he

209
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:18,160
amassed its president of fortunate five
billion dollars Omar Bashir in Sudan he

210
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,709
stole about seven billion dollars Hosni
Mubarak still in Egypt all about forty

211
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:28,200
billion dollars now let me put that in
perspective if you take all of the net

212
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,840
worth of all of the us- presidents from
washington all the way to Obama and put

213
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,960
all of their money in one pot over
couple hundred years that's about 2.7

214
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:45,280
billion this is like a poor dictator
takes away so these are just kamikaze

215
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,370
bandits and they still massive amounts
of information not just information but

216
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,480
they still massive amounts when the
Treasury and don't allow information to

217
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:59,110
get to their people so the way the
dictators work is always the same they

218
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,190
seized control of every aspect of
government cut away the checks and

219
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:08,230
balances pack these institutions with
their supporters and then begin to lose

220
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:14,680
the country now this is by using media
is by using technology is by educating

221
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,000
the people and ultimately this would get

222
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,900
this would lead to the people may be
rising up and overthrowing dictator now

223
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:29,450
that's always a decent outcome now after
that if steps aren't taken once you

224
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,690
remove the dictator you also have to
remove the things they left behind and

225
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,590
that's the subject for a different
lecture so I'm hoping that that I don't

226
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,709
today is giving you something to think
about in terms of how you live in a free

227
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,840
country most people on the planet earth
are not living in a free country so in

228
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,010
the lottery your life when you wake up
in the mornings you have to think this

229
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:52,770
way

230
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,780
oh my gosh I have got a winning ticket
you got a winning ticket on the lottery

231
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:01,290
of life you were born in a free country
where you have choice and you can choose

232
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:05,810
what to do with your life what what I
want to impress upon you

233
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,889
is always remember those people that are
living in countries where there isn't

234
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:14,130
freedom and always think what you can do
to help those countries and it starts by

235
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:22,340
becoming educated about what's going on
there so thank you very much

236
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:41,149
excellent question the question is how
did Cesar rise to power

237
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:45,919
ok I'm going to give you an analogy
alright I think of you as president

238
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,080
president gets into office and he really
really likes it really this is just

239
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,580
awesome in the supreme court says yeah
but you only have two terms you can only

240
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:00,240
collect yourself to terms did you know
we have term limits in this country I

241
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,870
want to have a third term and then the
judiciary says no you can't have a third

242
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,168
term to the president called on the
people said unpopular you want a third

243
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:10,980
term ok let's have a referendum those
who agree that I should have a third

244
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,570
term put their hands up and the guys
gonna be paying people and he's gonna be

245
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,500
silencing dissent is gonna be arresting
people who disagree

246
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,039
suddenly everything you get a third term
she gets elected for a third term and

247
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,110
then he heeee arrest the people at the
electoral office so many staff stuff the

248
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:30,039
ballot boxes and he cheats so so the
people believe he was elected and then

249
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:34,990
he says to the world I was elected I was
elected I got my third term fair and

250
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,659
square

251
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:39,679
oh and now I want a fourth term and now
I want a fifth term in the sixth term so

252
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,690
most of the dictators in the past they
seized power momentarily so around the

253
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,450
presidential palace I'm in charge here
shoot everyone gets in the way anyone

254
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,919
who disagrees with being goes to a
Christian now the modern style of

255
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:59,190
dictator is get elected first maybe with
a little cheating and then once you're

256
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,870
in power to change the constitution
change the constitution to allow me to

257
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,629
elect myself again change the
constitution to allow it to them

258
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:11,179
theoretically everything is done legal
but the question is always back to the

259
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:15,159
basics do I have the right to criticize
the president do I have the right to

260
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:18,669
speak in a free media do I have the
right to lead to have the right to own

261
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:22,529
property and if even if these are
several other right start getting taken

262
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:23,010
away

263
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:27,360
you not a democracy even though the
president likes to call it that most of

264
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,070
those 54 African nation's most of them
have elections but they're sham

265
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,409
elections and everyone knows they're not
real sometimes you read about a

266
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,350
president who got ninety-something
percent of the vote

267
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:43,560
absolutely not true that as your
question

268
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:47,440
okay so she's you're basically just
started cut cut cut cut cut away at

269
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,600
different powers he got rid of this
government that and just took it all

270
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,389
over himself and then he went up there
he said ok I'm now a god she went from

271
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,820
emperor to becoming a God power does
amazing things and makes people very

272
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,500
very crazy
