1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,450
talk on capitol of play and who's gonna
do quickly what is capture the flag and

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:14,170
talk about how you can compete in what
the challenges are like my name's jet

3
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,280
lag security robots track cross country
and

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:27,700
and minecraft netbook and what is
capture the flag capture the flag is a

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:35,360
unique series security contests where
you try to bring things I think Lee and

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:43,760
you get a flag so an example would be
breaking into a website to get a

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,010
password is usually two different styles
of jeopardy style where they give you a

8
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,070
board and you select different
categories and then you exploit those

9
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,870
programs or codes or websites and
they'll give you a flag if you do it

10
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:04,069
correctly there's attacking the facts
where you're given a system and they're

11
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:09,429
even a system and the same system and so
you try and find exploits in your system

12
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,350
and then you can exploit them on the
other system kind of like you try and

13
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,990
find the holes in your fence and so you
know where the holes in their fans are

14
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:25,179
many competitors are financed and
breaking theirs

15
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:32,220
capture the flag a lot of fun you can
learn a lot and you kind of learn in the

16
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,360
sink or swim situation where you get it
or you don't and you don't have a lot of

17
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:46,190
help around yourself and your TV and
your ability to Google and learn to

18
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,759
speak on behalf of others without
breaking the law

19
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,630
the nice thing about capture the flag is
that they're giving you permission to

20
00:01:53,630 --> 00:02:03,520
break these things so I capital is a
year-round event so you can do it almost

21
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,470
whenever they usually last 48 hours some
of them last week or two weeks though

22
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:13,800
which is nice but can also a
time-consuming you want to do other

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,400
things a good place to work with BCG
have time they have postings for

24
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,120
upcoming events and previously been so
you can look at how challenges result

25
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,880
peco CCF is a really good one for middle
school and high school they have a

26
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,130
really good program and they also if you
sign up the mailing list the late you

27
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,120
know about other high school middle
school dance that are coming out which I

28
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:45,660
like getting into the competition
there's usually four main categories

29
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:55,130
which forensics and exploitation those
already breaking codes usually do that

30
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:01,440
through ways either using math and logic
like in a substitution cipher where you

31
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,109
do

32
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:08,940
quincy analysis you look at how common
letters are and he's walking out of the

33
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,260
way would be working really really hard
by crystallography where things are just

34
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,899
plain sight so so am i right

35
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,090
invisible message like writing in lemon
juice

36
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,209
you hold under a black light and it
shows up being examples in order to see

37
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,790
where things are hit last we use brute
force

38
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,620
usually in a competition you want to try
and avoid this one because it's time

39
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:38,569
consuming and processor intense but it's
used to bring shoes and break the

40
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:47,129
password hashes example would be as they
give you like a Windows password hash

41
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:52,410
you might have to crack that it's just
to try every possibility until I get

42
00:03:52,410 --> 00:04:09,950
something that looks passable this is an
example of the fee where someone's

43
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:17,298
hitting on that file so I had enough
water and it's like bookends so anything

44
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:22,510
that's after the Porter is this regard
about the image processor so the image

45
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:32,520
looks normal but when you scroll down to
the bottom

46
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:47,948
it is to find a new biography you just
use sorry like being dirty X or X at it

47
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:56,370
and you can look through that is usually
three kinds of challenges that it'll be

48
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:03,789
like find the password or break into a
database or fake a cookie and so on your

49
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:09,389
password can be as easy as looking at
the source code for comments or for jobs

50
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:14,330
before they've done client-side
authentication so where the codes

51
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,180
authenticate that your real is running
in your browser is a really bad idea

52
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,620
because then you can change that and
attackers to change it and breaking into

53
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:30,099
a database sometimes you'll have to use
SQL injection to break in and steal

54
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:35,430
passwords or get access to it and this
is usually done through SQL injection

55
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:41,550
SQL injections kinda like a Trojan horse
you send the website your code and it

56
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,659
looks normal but then once it gets to
the database is interpreted and it turns

57
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:51,389
out to be something that executes its so
once that execute that it'll return

58
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:57,830
database information to the user
database information can be anything

59
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,190
from username password email to

60
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:05,280
credit card number phone number house
and social security number so depending

61
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:15,219
on what your story it's a bad idea so
here's an example of how client-side

62
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:23,320
authentication works this is how you can
find a password if they're often the

63
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:37,950
case in your browser using javascript
code for the web page and let the

64
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,990
comment

65
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:45,900
we find the JavaScript source or going
to the page and this is the jobs bill

66
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,810
that's being executed when you press the
button to try and login to the web page

67
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:58,920
so that it's reading through each
character of the user's input so it

68
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,650
starts at zero on it counsel the way
through it and checking if each

69
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:10,770
character matters what it thinks it
should be and so Jas 20 mins the first

70
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,460
character should be gay and then the
next character CBS and i underscore so

71
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:40,799
I'm just typing that out and then a CNN
and you win and will try and find

72
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,650
passwords or look at what website they
went to or who's trying to attack the

73
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:52,070
website and then there's recovering
files where the view an image a snapshot

74
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,719
of someone's hard drive and you have to
look through that snapshot and find

75
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,190
files or passwords or virus that
infected the computer and then find

76
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,340
whoever installed

77
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:27,349
this is an example of packet capture

78
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:34,729
that's not working but the way you solve
a problem like this would be you opening

79
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:41,140
wider short and you can just search for
strings so if you hit ctrl alt you can

80
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:46,020
search by a string or search and then
you can change it to be by string and

81
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,370
then you can look through all the
details in the packet and you can look

82
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,550
for password so that might bring up the
password for him or that can bring up

83
00:08:53,550 --> 00:09:02,040
the actual passwords mission part this
brings us to exploitation exploitation

84
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,449
is all about breaking things that's what
is possible because of coding mistakes

85
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:13,490
where the person who wrote the program
do a sufficient job securing it and so

86
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:20,600
as the attacker you're able to break the
program this is in CT outs that I do

87
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:27,060
most two most common are close to where
it's like a bucket and as you pour more

88
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,540
and more water into it fills up and
after fills up it'll start to overflow

89
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,230
and the overflow gets executed by the
machine organs returned to the machine

90
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:42,200
which allows you to do things like take
over the process where you can run your

91
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,160
own code and then there's format strings
which is where the programmer didn't

92
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:56,000
specify what kind of output you should
it should give so the attacker can

93
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,190
change that they can say instead of
returning a string return integer

94
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,860
Lawrence ever attorney an integer return
a memory address and then in that

95
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:13,610
address you can see what's happening and
you can look at the code below

96
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:26,860
example where you don't overflow

97
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:34,920
oh yeah sorry what's your question

98
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:41,880
so he found a bunker overflow in his
game where he could tell it is it tell

99
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:49,370
us how much money something else and
then you can get the money from it so

100
00:10:49,370 --> 00:11:02,670
number and then it gives you the item is
not merely simple version it's not as

101
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,990
complicated as a video game but the same
principle where you give it something

102
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:15,149
that's too big it will execute or so the
code for this is actually just saying

103
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:21,380
check if this variable is and if not do
something else

104
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:27,850
prints you win so variable is stored
right above the buffer so once you over

105
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:33,250
for the buffer but next thing gets
written to that variable so you want to

106
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:40,769
have that exact exact amount of water to
fill the bucket and so she is generating

107
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:46,779
a pattern so I can tell how big the
bucket is so I can find how many letters

108
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:55,120
I have to send to the program for it'll
change the variable so you're find that

109
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,889
it's

110
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:11,259
gonna be 70 76 bytes 76 characters then
in Python I'll print 8276 times and then

111
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:19,970
whatever it needs to be in this case I
think it needed to be da so that's how

112
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,850
you would go about it a lot of them
though the source code but then they

113
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,439
won't give you the source code so
sometimes it's just a matter of trying

114
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:36,988
things and looking at the code that's
why does anyone have any questions

115
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:44,649
ok I'm doing a workshop on capture the
flag now this is the URL for the

116
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:55,369
workshop there's some practice problems
like in the talk here

117
00:12:55,369 --> 00:13:00,639
cryptography is by gloira now waving his
hand
