1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,299
hi everybody good I think it's afternoon
now good afternoon several women's gonna

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,290
go to send a direct modeling and I know
that this is probably a basic percent

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,678
compared with other dogs here but we're
just gonna go through that we have

4
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:19,300
handouts about that modeling that are on
the table over there at the above shirts

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:26,160
which by the way and please everybody
shelter but many handouts right now I'm

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,740
really changed my name is Nadia an
activist with like 20 validation and

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,360
surveillance of the fence is one of the
things I T Y work on some of the tools

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,910
that we have and I teach people about
self-defense and usually what we do is

9
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,169
just start by going through modeling
which is what we're gonna do today

10
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:49,270
sure i'm new cardoso I'm a staff
attorney at the Electronic Frontier

11
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:56,850
Foundation I do litigation on privacy
and free speech and I am chief lawyer on

12
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,530
the case on yet its first case about
malware so threat modeling is something

13
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:11,990
very close to my heart melt together the
disclaimer which is certainly good buy

14
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:19,240
it and they are playing in so hopefully
they will be helpful

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,199
modeling is the way that you can about
security for yourself without having to

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,530
think about everything all at once makes
it a lot easier to figure out

17
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,210
what it is that you need to be concerned
about and you want to do it by starting

18
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,460
by asking yourself these questions what
do you want to protect really want to

19
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,530
protect that stuff from how likely that
you're going to need to protect it

20
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,240
how bad will it be for you and for the
people who care about you fail to

21
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,320
protect it and how much trouble you're
willing to go to to prevent that from

22
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:53,298
happening so what do you want to protect
very start with this and think about

23
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:58,530
what sort of information or files things
like that we would want to protect so

24
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,940
usually I like to try to shout out to
the audience at the anybody has any

25
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,810
ideas

26
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,550
delivered loud here for that so i think
what does go through the sides and then

27
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,600
definitely if you wanna you wanna shop
things out as we're going through them

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:31,030
please feel free to anybody have any
ideas what sort of thing what's

29
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:36,870
important in your life that you don't
want falling into the wrong hands on me

30
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:49,900
that's right money you identity identity
school teacher your friends or your mom

31
00:02:49,900 --> 00:03:02,780
to know about it what else that that's a
that's a good stay safe location who

32
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,540
you're talking to you that sort of thing
about like talking to you what are you

33
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,989
talking about you don't necessarily want
you are a teacher knowing everything a

34
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:15,829
conversation with your friends text
messages phone calls instant messages

35
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:20,170
files on your computer so like photos
that you took the stored on your

36
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:27,059
computer anything like that so do you
want to protect that stuff from I think

37
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,260
we started naming some people but
anybody else got any ideas what you want

38
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:47,140
to protect any of those things that we
just less than anything else they need

39
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:52,329
people who can get you in trouble

40
00:03:52,330 --> 00:04:00,569
that's right so good ministry U-turn
players unfortunately these days

41
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:06,679
10 or 15 years by a people of community
might be looking for you know things he

42
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
posted online

43
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,870
people who used to be friends with break
maybe you sent me a personal text

44
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,930
message somebody and you're right about
that getting out now just google your

45
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,549
name

46
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:24,489
preparations are other things that the
people that you might want to think

47
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:38,500
about death because people have ever
heard like tracking jacking up my so

48
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,639
this this is a good example a 360 is one
of the most popular and as you can tell

49
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,220
if it's on your phone

50
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:51,840
actually just a lot of people like them
wherever he goes to get sucked into your

51
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,638
GPS location information in it can say
okay you showed up at school at this

52
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:05,580
time it will actually sending a let me
put 1000 Barbie yeah ok if you hadn't

53
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,770
heard about it that the typically be
this is a wi-fi enabled the Barbie that

54
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,539
you can talk to and shall talk back to
you the way she talks back to you is

55
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:18,840
that she sends but you're saying to her
and the server think about what you said

56
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,250
and then send she responds so it's not
just so it's actually recording what

57
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:31,849
you're saying its wi-fi enabled and it's
doing what you're saying

58
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:40,259
let's just really happy how likely do
you think it is gonna be that you'll

59
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:44,319
need to protect it would only pictures
here because this is a question that

60
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,169
really requires that you just think
about your own personal situation and

61
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:52,109
arresting a specially back into it roots
you know depending on what kind of

62
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,289
working parents do that you might want
to think about that in terms of how

63
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:58,659
likely it is that you need to protect
something so it's not about you it's

64
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:02,069
about the people that you know and why
people might want to get information

65
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:21,800
about them or about you you know how
likely it is that you're going to need

66
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:34,729
to protect something so this question
about what could happen if you know have

67
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:38,979
good security and privacy so how bad
will be for you and the people you met

68
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:43,318
you failed to protect the things we
talked about so you know a good range

69
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,149
being embarrassed somebody get the
picture of you in like button on

70
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:53,699
Instagram and it's an embarrassing
picture to you know your money getting

71
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,999
getting stolen it if for some reason you
didn't protect that information to

72
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:09,009
that's right you know of course if you
are changing computers are showing

73
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:14,050
debates his parents information to be on
there too so credit card information

74
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,269
financial information

75
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:21,379
things like that definitely could be a
problem for the last question in this is

76
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:24,889
this is how you decide what you're going
to do what kind of steps you're gonna

77
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:28,769
take the own security is how much
trouble you're willing to go to those

78
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:31,480
consequences so for instance

79
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,010
you know if you are texting your pencil
out and you decide that you want to

80
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,620
start using encrypted and unencrypted
text messaging so if you text messages

81
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,400
more secure a lot of fun by probably
gonna be like signal that I don't really

82
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,880
want to put that on my phone so that can
be really annoying I'm getting in

83
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,700
might be a good idea for you to do that
you might want to try to convince them

84
00:07:52,700 --> 00:08:00,110
to do that so that has a website to
their own self defense and a lot of the

85
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,800
stuff that's coming plan including that
modeling is on there and we have lots of

86
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,450
tools that you can learn on surveillance
of defense got to email calling chat and

87
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:14,780
texting tools so text killing signaling
that I was just mentioning but also how

88
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,880
to make encrypted phone calls you can
learn how to do encrypted and

89
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:25,340
unencrypted chat and lots of other tools
to create good passwords and manage them

90
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,239
with a password manager cuz it's pretty
much impossible to memorize a password

91
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,280
if you are going to be using secure
passwords how to delete your data

92
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:41,909
including a bone in a hard day of how do
you store and lots of other things that

93
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:52,730
everybody knows winning caption airs but
just in case so incredibly important all

94
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,420
the time and there isn't a progression
Mike's email search engines donation

95
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,610
website sandbagging is because not all
of those places are going to be using

96
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,680
encryption

97
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:12,149
and we think that they should of course
so passwords are incredibly important

98
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:17,700
obviously everything you do online is
dependent on some sort of access control

99
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,970
I'm using email

100
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,560
how does how does gmail know it's me
they know it's me because I typed in my

101
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,510
password and I'm the only person who
knows it

102
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:31,230
passwords lock everything we do and keep
everything we do at least the tiniest

103
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:38,250
bit safe here knows what two factor
authentication is ok to dr.

104
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:43,810
authentication is awesome and you should
all be using it oftentimes websites

105
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:48,599
Twitter Facebook Google will give you
the option of putting in a mobile phone

106
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,930
number as well as your password and when
you log on to a device for the first

107
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:58,339
time logging from a device for the first
time Google doesn't just ask you for

108
00:09:58,339 --> 00:09:59,410
your password

109
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,490
it also sends you a text message with
the four digit code that you have to

110
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,700
type in that theory here is that only
you have both your phone which just

111
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,910
received that text message and knowledge
of your password so unless someone

112
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,870
steals your phone and figures out your
password

113
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,790
they can't get into your your Facebook
account or your Twitter account or your

114
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,969
Instagram account so two-factor
authentication helps you from getting

115
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:29,230
act even if your password is compromised
but there are a lot of things you can do

116
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,910
to keep your passwords from being
compromised one of the biggest ones is

117
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:39,800
don't use the same password for any two
services every password you have should

118
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:46,839
be unique and that can be a pain right
it's not easy to remember by 10:50 a

119
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,050
hundred different passwords and that's
why we recommend using a password safe

120
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:58,550
there are few out there last pass one
pass that have very very good encryption

121
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:03,459
and and and password management they're
not that hard to use I've gotten

122
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:04,989
everybody my family using it

123
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:09,520
and and we we totally recommended and
most of those solutions out there are

124
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:17,000
free and that requires is that you
memorized one really strong password

125
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,190
strong passwords should be unique very
long and randomized in some way could be

126
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,420
an alphanumeric string it could be a
string of random words that don't

127
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,370
actually make any sense to anyone but
you

128
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:37,500
it could be something completely
different but the longer the better and

129
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,940
it should be randomized in some way they
shouldn't be you know the the opening

130
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:49,339
line of Harry Potter that one's diamonds
taken that way so one of the things it's

131
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:53,000
always important to keep in mind is
beware password recovery questions and

132
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,440
fortunately almost every website out
their website has a password recovery

133
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,620
questions and how many people have been
watching any other capture the flag

134
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,580
staff writers anyways I think there is a
capture the flag social engineering

135
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:13,240
capture the flag was designed to capture
the flag for kids chair so there's also

136
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,110
a place you can figure out the answers
to people's password recovery questions

137
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:21,370
sometimes just a quick Google search on
their name is enough but you know you

138
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,870
can also get somebody you know you can
probably get that information so that I

139
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,209
can also happen to you and that's why we
always say beware possible couple

140
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:32,859
questions because it's pretty easy to
find the answers to almost all of those

141
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:40,730
commonly used by surgeons said he
mentioned so I'm self-defense this was

142
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,870
just like what is quickly going to
