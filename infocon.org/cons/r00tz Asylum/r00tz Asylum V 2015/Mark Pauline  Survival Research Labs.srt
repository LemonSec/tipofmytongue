1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,740
lol so I was going to be a little bit
peripheral tu hacker community people

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:16,770
here you computer people but but there
are some points in common I think what I

3
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,160
will be here today as I'm gonna talk a
little bit about as far away as I think

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,359
maybe somehow in my convoluted
imagination it may pertain to your

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,689
youthful desires and aspirations in the
background

6
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,450
they're gonna be showing video from
survival research laboratories events I

7
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,399
picked out some of my favorite moments
from the videos that reflect a little

8
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:49,239
bit about the reality of what goes on
its survival research labs now I started

9
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:53,959
this a long time ago I started back in
1978 that's way before there were any

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,860
computers to hack so I always kind of

11
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,760
I was like to look at it is kinda like
reality hacking that's kind of how it

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,679
always was for me and that's really you
know what it was what was possible back

13
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,360
then but for a variety of reasons

14
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:17,600
back in 1978 i SAT around for two weeks
and I thought up this idea the idea was

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,890
that you could take you could take
technologies like commercial

16
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,450
technologies industrial technologies
military technologies and you could you

17
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:35,750
could we combine them you can we combine
them and you could build huge machines

18
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:44,030
sets and props and you could you could
make them and you can actually use stage

19
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,079
shows with them

20
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:51,199
public events to prove that you had done
it and you just call it a show and at

21
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,049
the time I decided I would I would call
it

22
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,220
survival research laboratories because I
looked around and

23
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,140
I saw that corporations little ones that
really get away with the most kind of

24
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:09,360
crazy stuff and so it became survival
research labs for me it is a company

25
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,890
also caused a scene outside from the
fact that the events were a little bit

26
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:21,510
spectacular and kind of not really
anything anybody expected it created

27
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,660
attracted a lot of attention and it
started forming into an axial

28
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,370
organization that attracted a lot of
technical people because it was

29
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:36,280
technical in nature and it ended up you
know we ended up having like a whole

30
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,380
crew and the show's got bigger and
bigger and probably starting around 1980

31
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,010
you know the shows were you know there
were dozens of people working on these

32
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,390
shows almost pretty much like a feature
film production for every one of these

33
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,760
events now sitting down and thinking up
something like this you know it's it's

34
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,380
one thing to just say why just sat down
and thought it up you know that's really

35
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,620
how it came about but I think it's
really important especially you know for

36
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,670
for younger people to really understand
how these things come about you know

37
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,768
because it's the old like what you gonna
grow up to be like a fire person or like

38
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:15,300
you know you can grow to be a copy or
like you know the old kind of fifties

39
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,220
concept of like what you gonna do to
grow up well you know that's that's an

40
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,140
important part of the question for me as
a kid I grew up in a town Sarasota

41
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,440
Florida where there was the highest
percentage of millionaires in any place

42
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,150
in the country at that time in the sixth
fifties and sixties so a lot of the kids

43
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,730
I grew up with we're really rich kids
they had all these fancy things like

44
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,829
motorcycles boats and stuff like that
and i was just like a poor kind of

45
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,549
middle-class kid but I hung around with
them and very early on I think it out

46
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:53,870
like run with that crowd you had to have
like the bikes the boats but what I did

47
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,780
my approach was you know little bit of
stealing you know this is that you know

48
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,180
things we don't know which also has a
lot of

49
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,329
with the kind of hacking community but
basically I collected knowledge on how

50
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:10,620
to fix and repair all these kinds of
devices when I was a kid

51
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,870
young kid and then I could run with that
crowd of people I would have the bikes I

52
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,019
would have the boats I would have all
these crazy things and you know I had a

53
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,000
lot of respect because I was the only
one that actually knew how to fix

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,199
machines that were part of the social
coda in the in the fifties and sixties

55
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,520
like cars and motorcycles there weren't
a lot of people to fix because they were

56
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,219
rich kids and they would pay somebody
else to do it literally people I know

57
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,530
people who would pay people to build
their choppers back in the seventies so

58
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:48,559
so anyway I you know I got through that
business and i got out into the real

59
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,520
world and i ended up I was pretty good
at what I did I ended up working working

60
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,400
one of my first jobs when I was 18 was I
ended up going up to Eglin Air Force

61
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,698
Base and I ended up getting a job with a
civilian contractor for the Air Force

62
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:09,740
and the first thing they said they said
well can you read these plans and I

63
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,300
walked into this room and they had these
eight foot wide military blueprints for

64
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:21,449
30 ton targeting robots for 111 jets to
practice on strafing runs that looked at

65
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:24,699
the Prince and I said I can read
blueprints and I just went and I said

66
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:29,120
this means this this means that this
means that the guy goes you're hired and

67
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,280
so in a month or so I was the former on
the project knows making these huge

68
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,440
robots you know it's really exciting
working these huge machine tools and you

69
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,650
know all the latest welding gear and all
this stuff and just from nothing

70
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,120
building these things that were like you
know weighed like as much as the

71
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,940
semi-truck very exciting but then I
would look at the end I would see the F

72
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,750
111 jets coming down you know to make
their strafing runs I would go out there

73
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,270
and have to repair these things with a
low the drive motors off something I was

74
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:05,789
like you know what I'm to leftist for
this to antiwar to anti corporate

75
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:15,150
and so I decided that that I committed
myself and thought about it after the

76
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:19,750
two years I spent learning all these
skills I worked if you have a job I went

77
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,760
to college I get a degree in the visual
arts and basically I learned the joys of

78
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,460
networking and not having a job and I
learned that you could actually exist

79
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,659
without working and not having a job and
I said you know what I want to maintain

80
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,270
this and so I came out to San Francisco
with all these kind of ideas in my head

81
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:41,240
and I just sat down I want you know I I
love the tools I love the techniques I

82
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,950
hate the idea I don't believe that
there's a reason

83
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,670
a practical reason why things are made
in the real world I believe that I can

84
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:55,420
just make up my own reason for it and so
that's that's basically that's basically

85
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:06,260
what I did with SRL and you know it's
it's always been about four me finding

86
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:13,200
like a place you know in the margins
like sort of in the cracks of things

87
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:20,770
like you know a lot of people look at
SRL like if you like the art world we do

88
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,130
most of these shows and connections with
museums and galleries and stuff like

89
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,610
that around the world but there are
world always has very very suspicious of

90
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,290
me they're always think that you know is
this guy just like a mechanic or an

91
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,620
engineer Lee sort of a scientist or
something like that mean they are really

92
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,620
know because they don't know enough
technical things to make a judgment but

93
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,440
on the science world I know lots of
people in the robotics world in you know

94
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,350
the people at places like Boston
Dynamics and you know

95
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:52,710
various universities and they look at me
like you know this guy seems an awful

96
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,979
lot of technical stuff and his people
seem to know a lot may get these things

97
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:01,700
to work you know but but like he's
really really just an artist you know

98
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:08,849
he's that really really one of us and so
you know that is always the place to be

99
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,920
that is the place to be the place to be
in your career

100
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,950
from my point of view if your gonna be
pursuing the impractical if your gonna

101
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:22,150
be pursuing the things that don't matter
to anybody else like if you're going to

102
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:27,380
be taking a V one buzz bomb and like
which is like a real genuine weapon of

103
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:33,080
war and figuring out how to use it as a
sound generating to device to use in a

104
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:40,590
performance you know like that's that's
like finding the middle ground there to

105
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,300
me know that's that's made that's making
just the right compromise that's what I

106
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:51,329
always want to do I always want to try
to I always am trying to find like the

107
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:58,360
place that nobody ever looked before
with technologies and so you know these

108
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,210
these are just some of the basic ideas
around it and you know this has been

109
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:11,200
going on since 1978 when I started it
and coined the name took up the first ad

110
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,260
for survival as laboratories it's it's
been happening it's the we were based in

111
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,160
San Francisco until I got the boot from
there in 2009 and our moved up to a

112
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,140
bigger location north of San Francisco
but we've done these shows all over the

113
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,980
world

114
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,560
totally at this point we've done about
that sixty of these shows around the

115
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,670
world we just did a performance last
week at the at the Computer History

116
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:48,569
Museum in Mountain View so these
performances to me in the beginning it

117
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,750
was never enough to just like bill
damage machines and like come up with

118
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,200
some kind

119
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,490
weird idea you know when you know me
that's kind of it's a little bit too

120
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:02,420
much like sculpture and so its outset my
idea was always like ok all these

121
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,380
machines are gonna get made

122
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,400
we're gonna make sure they are kind of
work and take it out of the setting that

123
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,949
most mechanical research things are
built-in where if we can just get it to

124
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:19,260
work in the lab that's good enough and
that was never good enough for me the

125
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,980
idea to really prove the point that
these things function and that they

126
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:30,970
really work better than most prototypes
in a laboratory we have to bring him out

127
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,360
in the in the wild

128
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,260
that's what's called robots in the wild
that's what they're doing it the DARPA

129
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,439
Robotics Challenge trying to do you know
get these things to operate in the wild

130
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,490
and not just one at a time but get in
these shows there's fifteen or twenty

131
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,270
large remote control sometimes computer
control devices that are working

132
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:59,300
simultaneously in real time and have to
work in a coordinated fashion for 30

133
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:05,510
minutes to an hour and that requires not
just that the machines were requires a

134
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:11,069
sort of a group of people that can
connect themselves or are connected

135
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,390
enough psychically you know and of
course you know through radio and stuff

136
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:20,730
like that but it requires logistics
which is that which I always felt was

137
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:26,150
the next level above if you're really
gonna say we've fully co-opted the

138
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:32,290
corporate worlds way building in making
things and of hacking reality then you

139
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:37,699
have to really bring it on the devices
beyond the actual physical things and

140
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,360
bring it into the to the world of
logistics where everything but the fact

141
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,400
that it's even more to work it all
depends on a decision that you made a

142
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,470
month ago about are we gonna do this

143
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,180
bring this part as a spare or not

144
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:59,359
or is this person could operate this
machine or this person can operate

145
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:07,420
another machine and so so you know what
it ultimately it's like a shadow we can

146
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:14,089
go to the next video now you know I've
tried to create a shadow of like the

147
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:21,620
real court written military world and
and get it to function in a way that is

148
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,720
effective as those worlds get it to
function in the fact in the in the sense

149
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,180
that there's real products getting made
that really function in a robust

150
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:37,949
environment and it's always been about
collecting the right group people we

151
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:43,140
have a fantastic crew at us are all
volunteer I do most of the design myself

152
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,160
on the machines I don't build the
computers of the machines that's not

153
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:53,329
really my background but a lot of the
complicated stuff I'm the one that runs

154
00:12:53,330 --> 00:13:00,620
the crazies CNC machines that killed all
these things and so but it's always

155
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:07,540
about accelerating that curve and
getting closer and closer to what what's

156
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:13,329
possible in terms of manipulating
physical universe and to that end we

157
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:18,470
just recently got the ultimate physical
reality hacking machine which is a

158
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:26,220
German 5 axis CNC machining center out
of lick observatory and so that will

159
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,209
allow us to really i mean that is the
pinnacle there's really nothing out

160
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:36,760
there for the gonna make a real things
that are that are truly you know the

161
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:44,279
highest physical level that is the type
of machine that you need a couple of

162
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:49,740
things here you might wonder like how
the ideas for these machines come about

163
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,910
and that's one

164
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:57,800
you know when I started out doing this
you know the first the realization that

165
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,709
really hit home and made it made me make
the decision to do it was I started

166
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,520
breaking in 20 factories in San
Francisco and I looked around all this

167
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,740
equipment and I was like wow I started
reading the manual that were left over

168
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,700
in the offices and stuff like that i
mean they were complete factories in San

169
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,500
Francisco acute block square block
facilities full process equipment I

170
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:27,990
looked at all in all this connects
together it's all universally designed

171
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:37,250
to universally be combined into any kind
of process machine and so does one more

172
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:43,620
than modem and I just passed you can run
that again but anyway and so that was

173
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,050
that was the realization that made me
think I can do this why can't I make

174
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,890
these crazy machines and put this whole
thing together because it's all designed

175
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,880
to go to get it was all faded that way
anyway it's just nobody ever thought to

176
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,280
do anything different than than the
practical thing with the thing that was

177
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:06,360
going to make a bunch of money and that
was the difference at SRL but but

178
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,300
they're still at the time was a huge
amount of resources the head to get put

179
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:19,010
into you know you had to bill you know a
lot of stuff you know i you know i i i

180
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:24,160
boot straps on any kind of technology I
could find to build these things so that

181
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,010
I didn't have to like do any of the
developmental work for the components of

182
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,550
it but but at that time you know you
were just talking about industrial

183
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,900
components are components from

184
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:44,130
laboratories or military parts are ideas
for military equipment but but nowadays

185
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:50,860
you know there's this amazing it's an
amazing time you know you can buy

186
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,120
equipment for nothing I mean literally
you can buy a five-axis machining center

187
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,470
if you're careful I'm not talking about
a junkie I'm talking about a machine

188
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,580
that cost a quarter million dollars
eight years ago

189
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,680
you can buy them for $8,000 they are out
there you can buy that kind of equipment

190
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,010
it's amazing an amazing time the
equipment's out there and then there's a

191
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:17,220
whole process that subverts the typical
research and development process for

192
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:23,290
example this is a machine that I
retrofitted with oculus rift goggles

193
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:28,770
that and set it up as a true 3d
TelePresence System 3d telepresence is

194
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,720
something that you know friends of mine
at nasa have been able to even try to

195
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,860
solve that problem that problem for
years literally to get the video

196
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,310
synchronized to get the latency down to
like five to 10 milliseconds which is

197
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:47,209
what you need to do to control a robot
mode while they never were able to

198
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:53,750
really solve the problem after the
oculus rift came out in 2013 there was a

199
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:59,760
guy in Canada who just cause you know I
can do that with one $500 TGA and he did

200
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,829
a Kickstarter thing Mr labs they got
this little box that takes that allows

201
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:11,470
you to connect your oculus rift into
their get the head tracking out take two

202
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:17,020
composite video streams from Europe
radio wireless video transmitter bring

203
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,889
him bring him into this box turned in
this field sequential HDMI and you get a

204
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:28,880
perfect telepresence experience with a
range of like a thousand females all day

205
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,440
and her hobby stuff but you know that
stuff that like even if you had millions

206
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,890
of dollars that was a problem you would
have been able to solve a year too

207
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,660
nowadays there's stuff like that all
over the place

208
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:50,620
there's another another recent machine I
bill called the spine robot was you know

209
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,370
there's always been a problem with
tendon base robot because the key steel

210
00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:02,639
cables we're through the guys and it's
not very durable a couple years ago

211
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,760
you know just looking around the
internet a couple years ago four years

212
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,010
ago I saw that there was a company that
was part of the phone partly by the

213
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:15,190
military there was creating a type of
rope for Special Forces as a steel cable

214
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,290
replacement and I looked at the specs
and it's like wow i three cents Roper

215
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:24,860
floats on water breaking strength this
24,000 pounds I was like you could make

216
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:30,030
it 10 drove up with this stuff and so I
just you know I read about it because

217
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:35,530
they just announced a civilian wing that
was gonna sell civility in various this

218
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:44,050
cable for logging for pulling logs
through for us and for rock rock

219
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:48,419
climbing people and so I ordered the
equipment I just signed a whole robot I

220
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:54,390
call the spine robot around that which
solved the problems that people have had

221
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:58,320
with trying to make tendon base robots
and it got ten or twelve really hard

222
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,260
hours on it can look four hundred pounds
it can throw cinderblock about thirty or

223
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,720
forty feet and so again that was just
something just poking around on the web

224
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:14,520
you know these are resources that are
only available in the last few years and

225
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:20,900
so you kids are gonna you know you can
decide you know get involved but Im

226
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,160
Yoona dull they won't even be machining
anymore they'll just grow things you

227
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,160
know you want like a frame for something
about growing or something like that

228
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:35,610
though have smart you know smart and
need to grow into like a tank frame or a

229
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,679
car frame or something so it's all good
or all get a look at this kind of stuff

230
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,100
and like three bringing go

231
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:48,309
what a joke that stuff was but I think I
pretty much used to buy time I know

232
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:52,070
maybe a couple of questions that favors
got any questions

233
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:56,540
yeah

234
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:03,170
i cn C is a computer numerical control
machine what it does is it made a

235
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,670
computer and a cutting machine

236
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:11,300
the machines that I have theirs their
varieties of the machine I just recently

237
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:19,399
got from link observatory is that 10,000
ways 10,000 pounds it has has 3 accys

238
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,850
that whole the spindle that hold tools
has a tool chains that can hold multiple

239
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:33,510
tools and so what you do is you you
place a piece of metal black metal onto

240
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:38,950
the plate in there one of the one of the
acts as the basis of the machine and

241
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:43,540
then you bring a party can be like a a
part that you designed in SolidWorks or

242
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:49,600
any other kind of 3d program and you
basically when it through what's called

243
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,610
a post processor and you basically press
a button and the piece of metal turns

244
00:20:54,610 --> 00:21:01,050
into the drawing within a within a
tolerance of probably about thousands of

245
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:09,300
an inch and some of the parts to 10,000
the 10,000 civilians because machines

246
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,889
like a five-axis machine has what's
called thermal compensation that's what

247
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:23,399
is CNC machines basically amazing about
cutting machine and a computer

248
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:31,620
questions

249
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:36,760
well we did that back in the age 89 and
90 we actually have a contest with

250
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:44,450
Robbie Brookside MIT to be the first
people that could run and a life code on

251
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:50,680
physical machines so he had some small
machines at his lab and we get these

252
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,220
things called swarms which are about the
size of a person

253
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,760
squat about the size of 55 gallon drum
but like two and a half feet high with

254
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,430
sensors where they could detect each
other and then basically the program is

255
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,250
pretty simple they would move towards
each other and move away from each other

256
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:10,130
so you know we did some presentations of
this we presented in a couple of

257
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,850
different conferences and it worked
pretty good and Rodney Brooks sent some

258
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:18,620
of his grad students out to look at what
we had done and he said well you're

259
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,540
ahead of us because ours are working yet
so we did do that

260
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,940
back at the time but you know our
applications are sort of yeah it's a

261
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:32,250
sense of humor at SRL it sort of I would
call it really black humor you know sort

262
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:38,710
of humor and so what we did with this
the peak of application for us was in

263
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:43,220
northern France there is a seating area
where the couple thousand people in a

264
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:49,000
building looking out into our
performance area and it was nice and

265
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,080
flat so we had five of these in there we
just turn them on but they were covered

266
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:01,020
with decaying counterparts and so we
don't have any collision avoidance in

267
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,780
there this is 1992 with every collision
avoidance so they would swarm around

268
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,020
sometimes they follow each other
sometimes they go in different they go

269
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:14,400
in various kinds of patterns random
fractal kind of behavior and sale but

270
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,390
they were so gross that you know they
will get Stephanie never get stuck so

271
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:22,130
there was so disgusting they were good
the oddest people literally bombing and

272
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:22,710
kicking

273
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:27,909
and so that would keep them from getting
stuck so that's all the collision

274
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:35,450
avoidance problem and so that ran for an
hour and people in France did not think

275
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,899
it was very funny we have a problem in
Europe with our shows that people don't

276
00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:43,049
think there is funny they have a
different sense of humor than Americans

277
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:50,960
and so people think that I believe only
show was what their friends and that was

278
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:58,179
one of the reasons but that was yes we
did we did and those results angry

279
00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:04,700
French people nothing new at that now

280
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:11,070
right now though you know hey anybody
want to come and do it as a side private

281
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,980
it's always the issue you're talking
heavy systems integration to make

282
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,120
something about that were

283
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,739
that's a weak point unless you have a
lot of money to pay people to keep the

284
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,600
group coherent it's very hard induce
real systems integration across multiple

285
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:32,189
disciplines and you know keep it
together till it's done so maybe in some

286
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:38,740
future dimension will be able to do that

287
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:49,320
well william gibson called me back in
the eighties and he said you know more

288
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,809
when I have you a character based on new
in a book that I'm writing called Mona

289
00:24:53,809 --> 00:25:00,879
Lisa overdrive and I'm like ok you
drawing sci-fi writer I can dig it

290
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,460
thanks for thanks for the heads up so
there's there's a catch to this sort of

291
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:10,510
like you know reality hacking kind of
character in that book there's a pretty

292
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:17,070
good pretty good description of what the
original compound was like but it really

293
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:24,939
doesn't capture the true wild west
nature of SRL in San Francisco firstly

294
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:30,880
we never got captured either so that was
just a lucky break but you know gives

295
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,309
you an idea but if you want more
information just go to SRL door we've

296
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:40,540
been on the web since 1998 a website
says 1993 I don't know how many people

297
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:46,250
can say that but we've had a website
since 93 everyday won't go to youtube

298
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:52,230
and genuine survival research lab to see
videos of the exploits currently

299
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,890
happening at SRO thank you
