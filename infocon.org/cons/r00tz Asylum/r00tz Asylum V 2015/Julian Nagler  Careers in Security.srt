1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,529
hey guys my name is Julian and I'm lucky
enough to work on the facebook security

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:12,500
team we gotta go to work day in and day
out and protect that 1.5 billion people

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,198
that use our product everyday connected
family friends new and old and like

4
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:24,570
mines across the world this is pretty
daunting task but helping our people

5
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,480
shrink the physical boundaries of the
globe and catching all the bad guys in

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,240
the process is a pretty rewarding
endeavor I'm you today to remind you

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,830
about how important information security
really is to talk a little bit about

8
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,160
what a career in the field looks like
and to finally give you some creer

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,769
pointers on how to best prepare yourself
for really impactful job history but

10
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,850
first a couple questions raise your hand
if this is your first year at DEFCON

11
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:54,110
raise your hand if you get excited by
technology and everybody yeah raise your

12
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,230
hand if you use the internet everyday

13
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,959
all right now raise your hand if you've
heard of a major breach or attacking the

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,909
last year for some scary things are ok
so as you already are no information

15
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,950
security is incredibly incredibly
important more important than ever we're

16
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,390
putting more and more of our lives
online and in return we getting services

17
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,480
that we love to use online banking be
able to pay our bills shopping connected

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,409
to people in ways we never thought
before possible and it's amazing power

19
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,530
there that gives each and every one of
us but it also means that there's a huge

20
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:31,840
spotlight on security right now because
with these opportunities and convince

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,580
his connectivity there's increasing
risks and additional opportunity for

22
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,820
those with less than good intentions and
thanks to some very large hats and tax

23
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,619
the last couple years we've seen how
catastrophic destructive these can be in

24
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,240
the last year alone hundreds of millions
of people across the world have become

25
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,408
victim to data breaches fraud intrusive
malware in 2014 alone there's a 46%

26
00:01:54,409 --> 00:02:01,049
increase in data breaches mus 46 percent
one year so our jobs defenders

27
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,850
protectors gets more challenging as it
must be faster more flexible on

28
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,399
prevention detection response
capabilities attackers are getting

29
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,939
smarter motivated by financial gain
media fame and a new word has been

30
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:14,540
introduced into our vocabulary

31
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:20,969
cyberterrorism with all this the
complexity of threats increases and to

32
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:21,810
handle this

33
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,030
to address what is really in my mind the
defining challenge the 21st century by

34
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,000
building a safer now everybody we the
very best and brightest tackling issues

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,510
at all levels

36
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,840
unfortunately the curry out in this
regard it's very very worrying with the

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,760
astronomic rising importance information
security but demand for InfoSec talent

38
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,780
from that town has grown three and a
half times faster than the overall I T

39
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,909
job market and 12 times fasten a total
labor market and our current pace over

40
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:55,730
two-thirds of the jobs go unfilled due
to insufficient pool of talent did this

41
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,500
last year alone there are 200,000
national postings and took recruiters 36

42
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,329
percent longer to fill those in all
other job postings combined so for

43
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:10,400
example at Facebook it takes us about 15
to 20 times longer to fight to find and

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,489
hire really did InfoSec engineer as
opposed to normal software engineer and

45
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:19,010
that's really really difficult it's it's
it's really scary so in other words

46
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,340
everyone scrambling to find this really
high-quality InfoSec talent to meet the

47
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,500
growing demands of the industry and
luckily for you people in the room you

48
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,049
guys are exactly who are looking for so
if you're worried about a job

49
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:34,690
information are you worried about
longevity animation security you really

50
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,239
need not be you you guys are you were
looking for

51
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:42,690
so you all know information security is
incredibly an increasingly important to

52
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,650
the future of technology and national
security like so then what is it clear

53
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,940
to both cyclic like even myself I had a
really difficult time conceptualising

54
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,400
all the different teams and security or
do before I started Facebook at the it's

55
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,639
really invaluable County take a deep
dive and look at where different teams

56
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,049
doing a different career possibilities
out there are are out there so bear with

57
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:06,689
me for a second I'm gonna use this the
team that Facebook as a kind of model

58
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:16,449
I'm used it seems the model is how it
happened Facebook each department's

59
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:20,299
little bit different but you get the
general options out there so we have a

60
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,770
product security team are private
security team runs our bug bounty

61
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,020
program where we have white house
researchers across the world

62
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,580
world's meeting both phones and bugs
this team repose them and it works well

63
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:37,210
across functional partners to push
patches and we have a computer emergency

64
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,330
response team these the guys responsible
for detecting and responding to

65
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,068
technical threats that ames compromised
our infrastructure these our nation

66
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:49,289
states looking for protester information
these are individuals looking for user

67
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:54,750
data we have a software and team
responsible for building software to

68
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,870
protect our infrastructure a lot of its
log monitoring and and

69
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,960
anomaly detection we have an open source
security team that worked most closely

70
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,419
with our team is focused on developing
open source security products that

71
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,190
empower Facebook their goal is to
re-imagine how modern information

72
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,780
security problems are solved in Crete
free reliable software that allows

73
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,609
Facebook and other organizations to
improve their security really if the

74
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,810
industry as a whole doesn't just improve
our security posture we're kind of all

75
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,590
in trouble we have a safety protections
team these guys that are out there

76
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,669
catching the really really bad people
that use our site people with incredibly

77
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:38,490
nefarious intention we have a sturdy
operations team that you wrote mapping

78
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:45,610
budgeting project management technical
project management there goes to really

79
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,430
scale the organization in a way possible
that allows us to meet our goals so we

80
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,430
have a broad range of teams and what's
really interesting is when an incident

81
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,870
comes up with a we have a breach every
single one of these teams in one way or

82
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,800
the other is affected everything from an
open-source team they start looking at

83
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,730
ways to kind of patch a bigger problem
everything on his team gets pulled in

84
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:13,730
cross-functional manner and it's it's
really exciting to see so now you have a

85
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,950
better understanding of what the
different careers look like in the field

86
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:23,650
what can you do to best prepare yourself
for career earlier so first you use to

87
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:29,000
capture the flag competition before
awesome awesome ok perfect so we at

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,710
Facebook grand one here a couple of days
ago and it's kind of the perfect first

89
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,260
recommendation get as much hands-on
experience as you possibly can

90
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:43,080
nothing is more important than getting
hands on keyboards for every lesson you

91
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,900
learn a text book online do everything
you can to apply to recreate that lesson

92
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,729
on your own even at the college level

93
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,850
companies like mine have a really
difficult time finding students who

94
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,850
actually have the ability to do
themselves what they've learned InfoSec

95
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,780
town as you'll

96
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,260
InfoSec trickle imagine learn is far too
often

97
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,190
conceptual and there's very little time
to actually apply the concepts of

98
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,800
students are learning many colleges are

99
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,389
very against allowing students to hang
around and kind of implement what

100
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:17,610
they've learned and so any opportunity
to get hands-on experience is incredibly

101
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:23,280
incredibly valuable one at your level
I'd recommend participate in Pico CTS

102
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,900
Carnegie Mellon it's great for students
ages 13 to 15 after that their cyber

103
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,479
pitcher at the high school level of
course CCDC at the college level

104
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,099
Facebook sponsors all of them and we we
run competitions each one of them if

105
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:40,430
they're absolutely incredible I can't I
can't recommend it enough doing these

106
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,039
types of challenges lets you apply that
the aryan demonstrate your credentials

107
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:48,169
to someone who can actually code and
solve problems it gives you a proving

108
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:51,818
that you understand the best way to
apply what you've learned CTS in our

109
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:54,490
estimation are truly the missing
resource of the core curriculum out

110
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,479
there

111
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:00,800
ucts do as many extracurriculars
possibly can separate yourself from the

112
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,780
pack as you'll find when you study
information security there's thousands

113
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,659
and thousands of other students doing
the same thing so just like in any field

114
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:12,479
you separate yourself do as much the too
much experience as you can outside the

115
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,349
classroom leverage the huge repository
of online resources to increase your

116
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:20,830
knowledge of info second CES across the
board and we're totally build a

117
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,909
portfolio of your code to show people my
final recommendation here is

118
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:27,509
specialization so you guys are young
enough to have to worry about

119
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:32,589
specialization you need a color as much
as you can this point but companies such

120
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:36,779
as mine don't really look for very
well-rounded people from a technical

121
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:41,578
standpoint rather we look for
specializations so you folks have a long

122
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:45,899
way to go before you need to settle on
specific field but you're getting the

123
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,579
necessary understanding baseline in
those that try to identify and build

124
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:54,439
upon the things you get most excited
about is your learning now actually i

125
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,209
find some areas that excites you more
than everything else

126
00:08:57,209 --> 00:09:00,349
dig into that and make sure that you are
the best person in the world at whatever

127
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,300
you like right so when the company is
looking for someone to really good at

128
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:11,510
reverse engineering or malware analysis
or crypto that we can call on you and

129
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,370
you will be indispensable

130
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:18,910
specialization to channel Mark
Zuckerberg safety and trusted internet

131
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,850
or more important today than ever the
Internet is our shared space

132
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:27,990
it helps us connect it spreads
opportunity it gives us a voice it makes

133
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,079
us stronger and safer together to keep
internet strong we need to keep it

134
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:36,888
secure so in closing I request for all
of you each and every one of you have

135
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:40,410
risen the challenge come to DEFCON at
your age and you're you're taking the

136
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,339
steps that most evenings down to learn
that's fantastic keep doing it

137
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:50,800
keep doing it you clearly have we really
need more of you to stay passionate they

138
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,050
really curious never back down for a
challenge because you fear the unknown

139
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,750
that's what's juries all about we don't
know what the unknown this we don't know

140
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,649
what we need to know so literally the
only way to find out is to try take

141
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:07,259
risks and blazer on path as generic as
that sounds legitimate a candidate this

142
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:11,050
the safety and security of the Internet
in the future of the Internet depends on

143
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:18,219
you so keep studying keep learning and
apply everything you learn we will hire

144
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,959
you once you graduate thank you
