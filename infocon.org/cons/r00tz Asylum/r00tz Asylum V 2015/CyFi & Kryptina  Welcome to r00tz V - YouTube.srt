I'm group do you know the rules and

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,930
principles that we've created over the
years so so roots focuses on the

5
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:36,050
fundamental truth about the universe the
world is why we are all connected these

6
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,349
connections are growing stronger and
faster every day

7
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,809
chaos control the connections focus
control the chaos and you control the

8
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:54,260
focus and so we have some very important
value that is very important as he

9
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,829
doesn't mind in everything you do every
day very very useful so not only do you

10
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:03,670
go to cause we are here we are training
white hat hacker is the people that will

11
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,100
help fix the Internet

12
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:15,439
future goons of decline in fixing bugs
such as you might have remembered my

13
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:21,479
site by the year two contests from a
very very early on DEFCON kids asylum

14
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:28,249
and so what we did was we got all the
kids to participate in contests and find

15
00:01:28,249 --> 00:01:32,669
out that had a very certain is your day
in them and then what do you do that

16
00:01:32,669 --> 00:01:37,590
you're Daisy of reporting to us in your
email the company's telling them hey you

17
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,569
have a bug in your system in you need to
fix it and that is an example of what

18
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,189
happened in what we're doing here and so
of course I always wanna constantly

19
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:50,158
improving in always do your best to
innovate in thinking long term is

20
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,209
extremely important to the business
point in the internet his dream

21
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:59,520
everything you put on the internet is
permanent anything you post on Instagram

22
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,658
Facebook all of those pictures

23
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:05,939
anything you put out there is there
forever and is therefore good so you

24
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,850
want to be very careful on what you are

25
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,030
putting it into the internet and then of
course you always want to be positive in

26
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,150
visualize what you want virtualization
is very important if you're trying to

27
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,720
reach a goal visualization is very of
course you wanna have fun obviously

28
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:33,660
inspire others indefinitely go big and
go for your internet is a small place

29
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,549
where he gets around fast though here
are some good rules to follow so it's

30
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:45,480
very important things you own one
respect other people's items and yeah

31
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:56,220
what you gonna do not have anything you
rely on if you walk your front door and

32
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,000
long break and you don't have the key
you can't get in your house or something

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,100
but back to the rights of others that's
pretty given you want to respect the

34
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:16,460
privacy of the people and just them very
important to know the law and the

35
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,680
possible risks and consequences of
breaking it like you're gonna set up a

36
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,430
cellphone tower

37
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,659
that's kind of a very gray area so you
wanna know like the possible risk of

38
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:35,739
breaking it for breaking about life and
getting in trouble would be about $5,000

39
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:40,849
I think so are you willing to take that
risk that is what you want to know and

40
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:46,589
also another example is so do you know
that there is a law that says that the

41
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,730
American flag not touch the ground but
does anyone know the consequences for

42
00:03:50,730 --> 00:04:02,108
that breaking out there are absolutely
no consequence I just found a really

43
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:06,340
interesting because they have a lot but
no consequences and then also of course

44
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,780
finding a thief playground is very
important that is rooted style home and

45
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,719
it is in a meeting place to learn if you
have all these helpful people that can

46
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:20,079
help you on your path to becoming an
amazing happier and it's really

47
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,020
important because you don't wanna as
earlier you don't want two things you

48
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:31,590
rely on so that's what we're here for
one explain why we call it roots style

49
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:44,849
the first word through its to have full
control of a computer and it's not just

50
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:50,699
a place for crazy people and cash it is
a safe place to learn such as Edward

51
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:51,380
snowed in

52
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,639
he is seeking asylum right now in russia
from the USA government so he's trying

53
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,570
to find a safe place where he continued
to work and so here are just a few

54
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:05,509
things then passed through this island's
it is very fifth annual reads asylum and

55
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:08,729
receiver excited about this new just
want to show we're about where we were

56
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:13,570
five years ago so as you can see we have
for the first two years every this

57
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:19,349
island you're actually called DEFCON kit
and then we have a giant pile of paths

58
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:21,610
from last year

59
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:29,500
Tina Tina and I spent a long time
building that giant pyramid of cats and

60
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,560
then also you can see one of the badges
from previous year is also very

61
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,500
interesting as you can see you

62
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:46,320
and then we have the hacker jeopardy is
that we had here for the kids and I

63
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,570
think this is the year that my team won
I'm not sure though I think I think we

64
00:05:51,570 --> 00:06:00,400
did when I think that is looking back
and remember our first year free society

65
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,179
and we start off with about a hundred
people now look at us we have more than

66
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,470
a hundred and I didn't think that desk
line when doctor for started they only

67
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:20,500
had like 20 people I think so and the
route to a very good start here I hope

68
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:26,919
you enjoy our little contests and our
workstations we have like lockpicking

69
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:35,289
stations and the junkyard where you can
open phones and computers and see how

70
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:40,580
they work and what's inside so I think
that's pretty cool things you wanna hope

71
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,849
you have an amazing time here
