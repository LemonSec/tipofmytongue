1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,230
hi everyone so I'm going to talk about
the beaver project till originally this

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:13,400
stock is actually like regarding like
digital advertising had taken it but I

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,090
that's what I'm going to percent later
in the conference but I took a subset of

4
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:27,470
that and and I focused on fake traffic
so I think I kinda like that better so

5
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:33,469
let me go through it now so what
inspired me to do to stop so there are

6
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:39,739
two things that actually inspired me to
do to stop this is my job and my job is

7
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:46,260
to look at ads and determine whether
people who are looking at those ads are

8
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:55,440
actually human or their butts so why is
this even important so the idea is well

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,050
but cannot buy products so that's why we
want like you want people to be able to

10
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,250
like look at that right so and the
second thing that inspired me to do this

11
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:12,270
stock is well Justin Bieber and his 37
million Twitter followers so with fifty

12
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,670
percent it said there are fifty-three
percent his face that's still a lot of

13
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,070
followers right so so so well I can't do
it too I do Twitter too

14
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,639
so this is my Twitter account like for
four years ago for another death count

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:37,259
up and right now it's still 21 followers
not doing too well let's catch up with

16
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:45,520
Justin Bieber Justin Bieber is my
inspiration I decided to do the same

17
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,810
thing and by Internet traffic myself so
that's where the people project came to

18
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,149
fruition

19
00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:00,290
so basically the project is just a
network of websites that act as honey

20
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:06,939
pots are you guys four million honey
parts so many parts are basically like

21
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:10,090
tools that record information

22
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:16,769
basically record information for
analysis so what I did was I purposely

23
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:22,390
pointed bad traffic to those to the
multitude of Justin Bieber blog site me

24
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:29,879
so bad traffic posted to the blog it
records and I saved it for analysis

25
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:37,290
latter time so how do you actually
record like these views and stuff so you

26
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,569
do it you can do it by JavaScript and
you can do it like using other

27
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:45,149
server-side script that's why I
JavaScript client side script in a

28
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,620
server-side scripting combination of
that so you can easily like Greg get

29
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,230
like a lot of information out of those
visits then I started it up for an hour

30
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,119
this is well so I said from that aside
from the blogs I also uploaded likes

31
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,599
them YouTube video you see there

32
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:08,629
0 no pues I just did that like a couple
of days ago and of course my my Twitter

33
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:15,130
so so I might as well use my twitter
stuff for this stock right now defined

34
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,760
by so so I started like buying Internet
traffic so one thing that you can buy

35
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,209
all sorts of stuff from the internet but
please be careful guys don't do this at

36
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:30,130
all don't use your parents credit cards
to buy ice Internet traffic and stuff

37
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:37,160
like that so at first I thought it was
hard to like look for these like by

38
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:43,010
Internet traffic in the internet but
actually it was very easy and you see

39
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:48,239
like tons of vendors out there so these
are just some of the few vendors that

40
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,010
i've seen

41
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,440
like an accused and there's actually
like marketplaces where these vendors

42
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,390
actually advertised and these are some
of it

43
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:03,290
Fiverr SEO courage they found a lot of
stuff in SEO clerks and of course not

44
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,160
only that you can buy Internet traffic
and you can actually buy application

45
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:15,500
specific traffic just like you to abuse
you two blanks YouTube subscribers and

46
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:23,410
of course my favorite Twitter followers
4004 a bug so not too bad so did it work

47
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:32,400
so of course they did I would be here if
so so my my blog Justin Bieber blog has

48
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,460
like now hundreds of thousands of use
for as low as 10 bucks not too shabby

49
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:45,880
shabby bill how about me YouTube stuff
so in three days I got fifty thousand 81

50
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,510
views

51
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:52,050
hundred 80 likes actually now it's about
two hundred thirty's still growing

52
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:58,510
230 subscribers for 30 bucks a little
bit on the expensive side but not too

53
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:04,110
shabby for three days then here's the
thing is my favorite so remember my 21

54
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:12,800
father is right and Twitter now I have
4309 Twitter followers in Twitter and

55
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:20,460
two tweets I tried reading not yet to so
used to tweeting was no anyway what is

56
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:27,750
fake traffic made up mostly bugs mostly
by three so how do you know like because

57
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:34,890
the clues I really interviews so that's
where you find like what if an

58
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:39,400
impression or a view is about are not so
there are a lot of clues so where do you

59
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:45,469
find these clues you know browsers
browsers week a lot of information and

60
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:51,470
likely Cup ton of information you can
get a lot of information out of it so

61
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,770
for example in this case you can look at
like blood

62
00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:00,520
like this in some of the body won't see
that it has plug in mind type screen

63
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,270
attribute sometimes you don't even show
up it'll show up that it doesn't even

64
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:10,099
have a screen like window attributed to
show that it has like tiny little

65
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:15,389
viewports product identifiers sometimes
there is no product identifiers

66
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:16,919
whatsoever

67
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,590
navigator attributes locations
framerates browser rendering attributes

68
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,039
user ages and there's a ton of
information that you'll see when you

69
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,729
start recording these impressions and
that's where you find whether it is or

70
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:36,520
not and it's very distinct you'll you'll
see you actually see if it's if it's a

71
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,469
human or not so as I mentioned I use
JavaScript in a mixture of server-side

72
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:47,880
code so here are some of the results but
here's the thing how are these traffic

73
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,139
generated like yeah well it is generated
by traffic generators so there's also

74
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:58,169
like a ton of those what I did was
purchased traffic right but you can

75
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:03,180
actually purchase the tools that
generate traffic so so I just took some

76
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,979
screenshots of this stuff out there so I
won't be talking about like each and

77
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:12,639
every one point of that point I'm doing
is really just showing that yet there is

78
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:21,349
a lot lot of two lots of tools so so all
of these traffic generators you can

79
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:28,880
actually like make them click at a
certain location sleep at like certain

80
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,610
like element in the and stuff like that
you can set you can set user agents

81
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,860
customer offer and proxy support what
you're up these very important because

82
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,819
like what's for example you start
generating traffic and it's only coming

83
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:50,259
from your desktop your IP address so
that's kinda obvious right so you need

84
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:55,789
to use proxies like different like IP
address it so it looks like the traffic

85
00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:00,279
going to your site is coming from
different locations so that's the

86
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,680
general idea

87
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,620
that then you can also use like custom
stop there is a lot of custom stuff out

88
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:13,160
there in one of the most popular one
actually to build internet bots is this

89
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,979
called you bought studio and the thing
is you got three years actually a legit

90
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:23,310
software it's a great software actually
it's it's used by webmasters to automate

91
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:27,940
tasks but unfortunately with all good
things you can like kind of perverted to

92
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:34,849
like something bad so a lot of like
water is used this to like automated

93
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:41,709
creation of accounts like farmers
automate the clicking of stuff like

94
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:47,319
licking likes and all of that stuff then
just visiting pages so you can but

95
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:54,330
honestly this is an awesome application
it's very easy to use then very easy to

96
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:59,190
program so you bought studio and there
are other kinds of stuff that generate

97
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,779
traffic not only traffic generators in
like you but studio and stuff there's

98
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:09,020
also traffic exchanges this Chinese as
what you don't need to know trainees to

99
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,100
like that use this it's called gimli so
it's a traffic exchange so you know what

100
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:20,709
happens here so what did that he's
instead of visiting your website what

101
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:25,529
does this when you install it on your
computer you visit other people's

102
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:30,480
websites but that's going to be a great
as your other people's websites you

103
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,029
collect tokens and the more you have the
more chances other people who have been

104
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:40,620
stalling jingling in their computer
would visit your site so traffic

105
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,459
exchange rates for exchanging traffic
basically so what's new with this is you

106
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,959
don't need a proxy because the traffic
is actually coming from different ideas

107
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:58,979
already by its nature so next well
before I wrap things up I'd like to go

108
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,630
back to my tweet their stuff since I'm a
bit obsessed with that trip there think

109
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,230
so what I noticed with that winter stuff

110
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,820
is the majority of my Twitter followers
that no teens and sometimes if they do

111
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:19,160
have to eat it's nonsensical and they
have very high following out so it's not

112
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:25,069
really like very high quality followers
that that I have so in any case let me

113
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:31,360
wrap things up what is the moral of the
story can I buy fake traffic like

114
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,780
subscribers and followers yes yes we can
do that they accept credit cards people

115
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:45,760
be kind and stuff so it's relatively
cheap relative so does it work

116
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,300
yes it does work you've seen my you seen
my hundreds and thousands of impressions

117
00:10:51,300 --> 00:11:00,510
in interviews you are you seen my
fifteen thousand views that YouTube like

118
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:06,069
in three days you've also seen my for
thousands of followers in Twitter so it

119
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:13,040
yeah it does work but friends with you
about followers know so we can do that

120
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,120
so well this moral of the story really
is having a few real friends are better

121
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,350
than having thousands of us so anyway
thank you very much
