1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:08,390
well hello everybody my name is Amy and
this is mine spec and her name is Angela

2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:15,739
we are two sisters from the great white
north of canada and this is my third def

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,640
con

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,500
I've been of roots kids since that and
this is my sister's friends here

5
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,330
so today we're going to be talking about
secret messages and gravity falls

6
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:34,670
keeping within the crypto and let's get
started in many popular television shows

7
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,510
today but i usually something to keep
the watcher entertain and guessing a

8
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,010
mystery for my sister and i are watching
this particular television series called

9
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,120
gravity falls

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,870
we found many colors throughout the
episodes this management tool it much

11
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,870
more so we could decode and discover
more about the show

12
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:58,789
so the first episode in the first season
you can see that there are two seasons

13
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:00,859
up on the board

14
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:05,840
season one has been completed and season
two is in the business of completion

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:17,540
so the first exercise but we've seen is
entitled to trapped in the first episode

16
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,070
in the clinic

17
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:28,880
there's a cryptid message and there's a
message and in the credits and it has a

18
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,820
coating the bottom where where you can
become using these are safer

19
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:46,880
well technically message from my sister
and I look for words that consisted of

20
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:55,039
two or three letters to figure out the
most witches pattern as shown in the

21
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,899
coded message the to learn r WN r which
are two spaced-apart let's say 20 take

22
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:04,369
faces apart

23
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:09,709
my sister and I went over some common
two-letter words - - test on our CSI

24
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:12,709
four-wheel to see the letter search book

25
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:21,410
we need the layers for twenty paces
apart so whatever they're coming to the

26
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:26,209
other words such as as it to be
something about that

27
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:33,019
like wnr in the previous slide and T and
L are also 20 spaces apart

28
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:37,190
I have been making a table and going to
be under the w

29
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,650
and I remember where I we can now from
the decoded alphabet and then knowing

30
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,640
what the code letter route letters mean
it is now possible to interpret what the

31
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,380
message is saying so

32
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,250
family message at the bottom we find out
that said welcome to gravity falls

33
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,070
so the result was a caesar cipher one of
the forms with the encryption using

34
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,970
gravity files is the Caesar cipher the
seven cutting a strong so that won't

35
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,609
matter of the ultimate means in
different letter or decoding

36
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,020
however is always in alphabetical order
so the next

37
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,950
absolutely i'm going to type of event is
different verses manliness

38
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:20,299
well this episode was a very important
Compton message because after the

39
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,460
december that using the Caesar will you
tell us that mr. Ceaser and will be out

40
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:31,370
next week and mr. a - we'll substitute
this meant that we progress to the next

41
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:38,240
episode that secret code of the credits
of the episode will not be using these

42
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:46,910
are safer but at batch another type of
thing corruption used in gravity falls

43
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:51,680
is called at - this type of coating is
formed so that each letter of the code

44
00:03:51,680 --> 00:04:02,000
actually means the inverse when decoding
mixed show that that we found was very

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,860
important with boss Mabel

46
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:13,550
because because there was a new type of
secret message encrypted with a - this

47
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:19,090
this felt heavy is the head that wears
the fence a fence is a half

48
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:29,320
that that Stan we're in in TV series the
final type of encryption used in the

49
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,449
first season of gravity falls is anyone
that 26 these type of counting is fun so

50
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:38,139
that each letter of the alphabet is
converted into its never form

51
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,770
remember for the letter anyone because
it is the first letter of the alphabet

52
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,180
progressing to bed which would be
expressed as 26 the last letter of the

53
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,050
alphabet

54
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:53,200
so when the last episode of gravity
falls is where we found a very important

55
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,520
message which was done in the a1's at 26

56
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,969
so we found that the message at the
bottom said reverse the ciphers which

57
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,400
leads us to review season one

58
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,710
so we learned that there is the Caesar
cipher in the first episodes the active

59
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,780
so far in the middle episodes and a ones
that he had 26 cyber in the final

60
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:22,030
episodes and then we went to yourself
well why did mr. Hirsch the Creator want

61
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,888
to teach us about these diapers

62
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:27,520
well we got to thinking about season two
so let's take a look at season two

63
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:32,799
so as the series progresses the
encryptions become increasingly more

64
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,700
difficult

65
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,810
in addition to the regular coded
messages at the end of the credit card

66
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,370
including many other clues and codes
appears after while coding these cars my

67
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,940
sister and I found that these messages
uses two or more different types of the

68
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,229
encryptions that was shown in the first
season so we're going to look at the

69
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:56,650
first episode of season two called scary
okey so but not just going back a clear

70
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,099
from the final episode of season one was
reversed the snipers

71
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:01,420
so my sister and I

72
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:07,000
my first the ciphers what we are
decoding the code in this episode we

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,310
went as you can see there it is that the
batter

74
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,640
it's written in red and it's written in
a one said 26

75
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:22,420
so we took the message and we use a red
there are 26 and that got to let that

76
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,910
God is like this jumble of letters at
the end

77
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:30,040
sort of like this is not an english
spanish using bell code that was willing

78
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,240
to the papers

79
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:37,420
we took the output of the anyone read 26
and used at bash this for the relievers

80
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,740
for a bunch of letters

81
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,480
so then we decided to take the outback
effort and you Caesar and this time we

82
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,590
got us some of your words which was the
man upstairs is very clever

83
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:52,869
can he hide his fans forever so that is
another thing that we notice about these

84
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,880
cards in the closing credits is that
very reported around the track pad and

85
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,490
the endless bad part of this card so we
figure out the words include to a puzzle

86
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:09,430
because not everyone had the same paper
brother around it so that it doesn't

87
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,270
have at the at the season is still
progressing

88
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,690
there are some cards missing in the
middle which will probably be shown

89
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,850
throughout these final episodes

90
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,290
so in conclusion there are a lot of
secret messages in the show and we need

91
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,260
to know how that have ciphers work to
throw these messages

92
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,789
so thank you and tradition to this would
you like to see a school for the deaf

93
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,320
kind of badge

94
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:39,670
yes sir and so we're looking at out with
some badges master and i found this type

95
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:46,060
of we're heading at the bottom of side B
so we seem better and last other people

96
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,210
who have different color badgers badgers
to see you and take pictures are

97
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,469
and the back of their badges so we could
see the different type of messages

98
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,280
behind

99
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,409
there's that we look closer at the groom
bad message we can see the same world

100
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,340
appearing twice

101
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,568
hello sister and dad found out that this
was the substitution cipher

102
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:11,060
so the mouth of the substitution cipher
the more clues you can get and then we

103
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,800
found that these two words that are
circled them to send your letters

104
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:22,130
so we have there's not very many words
that end with the service three letters

105
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:29,210
and they're only two letters that and at
the end are usually essences

106
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:36,708
so we looked back at all the defect we
look back at all of the last two letters

107
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:41,179
every plant during the letters that
matched those dimples

108
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:45,410
we found the E and the s in all of the
women's and it's like putting a little

109
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,250
affection because you have to guess the
letter and see if it fits in seven

110
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:54,050
finally be too kind of a little def con
badge message was sent mystery is the

111
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:59,449
source of all true art and sites have no
idea what this means but apparently

112
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,930
those the death card badge message we
can get the black patch so I'm guessing

113
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,729
this has some kind of it

114
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,600
thank you so much food to our stock
