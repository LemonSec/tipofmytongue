1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,830
thank you thank you so I'm hi my name is
that you wanted in and i'm going to be

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,000
speaking about one of the most famous
unsolved codes in the world which is

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,378
called cryptos at the center of CIA
headquarters in Langley Virginia

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,020
there are four codes on it three of the
four have been solved the fourth has not

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,119
been solved yet it's what most famous
codes and you know the big brain people

6
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,630
with lots of college degrees have been
working on this for over 20 years and

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,640
have not crafted so I believe it's very
possible that it's going to be a kid

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,170
that is going to make the intuitive leap
that is going to finally crack this code

9
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,370
so that's one of the reasons I'm here to
share this information and I've got a

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,739
bunch of really cool graphics and Adam
pictures here and some stuff i'm going

11
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,010
to go through really quickly but of
course I i can always talk about it

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:53,669
later

13
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,859
i will also have a code challenge that
we can do in the workshop here after my

14
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,079
talk some of it is related to clip this

15
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,990
so this is the new sculpture I'm going
to be talking about it's at the center

16
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,798
is in the courtyard between the original
and new headquarters buildings at the

17
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,590
CIA and it's about 12 feet tall 20 feet
long has thousands of letters carved

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,229
into the copper sheets there and i'll be

19
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,009
don't worry i'll be telling you what it
says I first heard about cryptos through

20
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,000
a hacker con which is called freaknic it
takes place in Nashville there had been

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,900
a code released at freaknik three as a
challenge to the attendees of the

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,340
conference and no one cracked it so a
year later I was at a convention called

23
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,450
dragon con

24
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,680
atlanta and the hackers they were
handing out the code challenge thing hey

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,380
if anybody can solve this you win a
prize

26
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,469
and I picked it up with all the other
stuff you get a convention i took it

27
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:51,089
home and I cracked it took me 10 days
but I won the prize which is free trip

28
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,920
to a hacker con and free hotel drinks
two shirts and all that stuff and I went

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,740
to a tutorial about how I cracked it

30
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,460
and on the sheets that i'm going to be
giving out those you are although there

31
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,818
and i also have it on the sheets and so
you can go through and you can work

32
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,449
through the tutorial to see all the
different steps of the the freaknik 3

33
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:15,899
code and I also hid some codes within
the tutorial a sort of in jokes to think

34
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,849
you're welcome to look for those as well

35
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:21,390
but while I was solving the frequent 3
code it was sort of like an onion it was

36
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,768
layer after layer after layer and in
there were dead ends as well there were

37
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:30,299
red herrings and one of those dead ends
was okay you've gotten this far now go

38
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:35,400
here and it was a URL to the CIA website
and it had a picture of the crypto

39
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,140
sculptured CIA saying go solve this now
and I when I saw it I thought oh well

40
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,399
crypt us what's this

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,030
oh it's one of those famous unsolved
codes in the world haha i was a joke in

42
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,180
the frequent free code and then I went
back and I saw rest of the frequent 3

43
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,709
code but while learning about cryptos I
learned about how the first three parts

44
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:58,200
have been solved for having been solved
and this is before part 97 characters of

45
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,208
the very bottom of one of the plates

46
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:04,019
we don't know what it says so whens
cryptos well as the sculpture was

47
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,889
commissioned when the CIA wanted a new
headquarters building and when they

48
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:11,549
build a new building in washington DC
are really kind of anywhere

49
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:16,980
they generally also higher artists to
put large sculptures and other art and

50
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,388
the gardens around that building and one
of the artists that was chosen was a man

51
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:22,980
named Jim Sanborn

52
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,420
and so he decided he wanted to do a
sculpture with a theme of encryption and

53
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,290
the car he came up with the messages he
carved them into the sculpture and he

54
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,290
was that he'd learn about photography
from

55
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,640
a man named - I was the chairman of the
CI cryptographic center at the time

56
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,768
this is a picture of Jim Sanborn he's
still living he was born in 1945 and

57
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:46,849
Washington DC and i found out some more
information about him he studied

58
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:52,879
archaeology have been the oxford and the
I tried contacting his agent I said well

59
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,439
I want to solve cryptos can i find out
what else and board has ever done and

60
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,108
the agent said I don't know that would
be impossible we can make a list of

61
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:01,849
everything samples ever done

62
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:05,358
he's done too much and I said okay I'll
make a list of everything Sam . super

63
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:09,109
done and so I did a lot of research on
Donna I made a whole website about him

64
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:13,010
and started collecting work on
collecting information on all of his

65
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,969
works and and then one day I got a phone
call from Jim Sanborn saying

66
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,169
who are you and why do you have a
website about me and so then I got to

67
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:25,969
talking with them and now we're better
friends we communicate more so he's he's

68
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,560
given me some more hips and so i'll be
including those in this talk but you

69
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:30,889
know

70
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:35,870
Kryptos part 4 still has not been solved
now how famous is crypt us

71
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,099
I have a list of the world's most famous
unsolved codes on my website gawker.com

72
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:45,380
I put cryptos number 5 higher than
crypto so i would put something called

73
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,840
the beale ciphers or the Beale papers

74
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,380
there is a I think there's a documentary
going on right now about the beale

75
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,330
ciphers on myth hunters

76
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,570
if you watch that you'll see me as one
of the the talking heads talking about

77
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,080
it

78
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,270
there's the voynich manuscript and that
is a special bonus here

79
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,830
i actually created my own copy of the
voynich manuscript i downloaded all the

80
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:12,260
images from the yale university rare
book library so at the crypto workshop

81
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,380
after my talk with anybody x actually
wants to see the voynich manuscript

82
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,240
killed

83
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,460
able to do that doorbell cipher elgar
Zodiac killer and then

84
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:26,560
Kryptos this is pisses my own list so i
wanted to see cryptos and it's a long

85
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,810
story of how i got to see it because my
cousin and I after sep tember 11th i was

86
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,910
visiting him in Washington DC and and
then i would try to get in to see is the

87
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,650
end and big guys with guns turned us
away which is what they do when you try

88
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,508
to get into the CIA and you don't have a
pass and that's what I'm saying home

89
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:50,259
can I get into CIA and these big guys
were that were turning us away kept

90
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:53,560
things are you can only get in if you
have official business

91
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,979
official business when I think some
official business can i make up some

92
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:01,508
kind of official business that will let
me get into CIA headquarters and ever

93
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:04,780
said this was right after September 11
and what I did is I did a lot of

94
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,008
research on the kind of codes that
al-qaeda was using to plan the September

95
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:13,870
11 attacks and then i was wondering if i
could use that as the official business

96
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,349
that would let me get into CIA
headquarters in order to see quick tips

97
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:20,199
but then I say okay how do I get the
invitation

98
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,509
so every time I would give my talk about
the al Qaeda codes i would be doing this

99
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:29,650
universities and different hacker cons I
was a boy i'd love to give this pocket

100
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,580
CIA someday

101
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:36,909
boy I'd look at this talk and see is
some day so go to back to DEFCON i think

102
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:41,710
it was 2002 when I was at the Alexis
Park Hotel and I was giving a talk about

103
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:46,359
steganography which was in the big tent
on top of the roof of the elections part

104
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,650
and there's maybe a thousand people in
the audience or so and i was saying boy

105
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,388
I'd love to give this target CIA some
day and at the end of the talk

106
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:58,930
people come up to give you business
cards and stuff and one person from the

107
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,199
audience came up and they leaned across
the podium and they look me in the eye

108
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,469
and they said i work at Langley

109
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:10,810
i think i can get you in so it was an
undercover CIA agent

110
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,190
defcon who actually got me an invitation
to CIA headquarters I see a question

111
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:22,960
here you burning with the question how
surprising to have undercover CIA had

112
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,530
that kind of that so I i I'm a bit of
gratitude to DEFCON 2 and let me give in

113
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,638
to see CIA and it to see crypt is at CIA
and i told him i give my talk but I

114
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,080
wanted time to see cryptos and i was
able to get some rubbings of the

115
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,789
sculpture while I was there

116
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,300
so each of these is done on an eight and
a half by 11 inch piece of paper to give

117
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,830
you an idea of the size of the lowers
there are pretty gross and I was evil

118
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,620
even able to get an official
photographer to take a picture of me

119
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:56,110
next to the sculpture so hard for sure

120
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,820
help i can go from microphone Part one
starts at the top of the plate on the

121
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,389
left

122
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:06,010
come to go to the bottom of that plate
three starts at the top of the next

123
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,880
plate and then part 4 is about four
lines at the very bottom

124
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,240
the other two plates are what's called a
visionary tableau and i'll go more into

125
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:19,090
that so yeah i'll talk about a cipher
alphabet and how the key word was built

126
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:26,020
now the first three parts were publicly
solved in 1999 by a man named Jim

127
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,490
globally a California computer scientist
after he made his announcement made

128
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,810
international news

129
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,740
the CIA and now saying will weave that
someone who solved it last year and

130
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,349
internal analyst named David Stein

131
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:40,870
but we didn't make any public
announcements because it was just you

132
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:46,030
know internal CIA and that not a little
bit of news and then the NSA came

133
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,600
forward so we've got people who solved
it too but we're not going to tell you

134
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,920
who are not going to tell you when which
is a very NSA thing that the no such

135
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,479
agency so I kept pushing on that like
okay well who solved it they said it's

136
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,950
classified I'm like this is a record

137
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,790
national cyber there's no reason that
this needs to be classified information

138
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,390
that is not a secret that's important to
national security

139
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,070
so I eventually found out that it was a
four-person team led by a guy named Ken

140
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:13,610
Miller

141
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,120
Dennis McDaniels and then I said okay
well can you send me your notes from

142
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,360
when you worked on it and he said no no
it's classified

143
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,340
and I'm like again why is it classified
so again I kept pushing a bit and i

144
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,590
found out that in 1992

145
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,910
the sea is deputy director Admiral
William O student who used to work at

146
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,610
the NSA but was now at the CIA said back
to the NSA okay you guys are so hot

147
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,610
solving codes let's see how hot you are

148
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,230
and so the director of the NSA at the
time vice admiral john mcconnell like he

149
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,070
took up the challenge and they put
together a team a four-person team to

150
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,630
run computer attacks the NSA computers
to end they were able to solve the first

151
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,320
three parts by just number nineteen
ninety-two but they could not solve part

152
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,540
for either so they wrote up there

153
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,930
the report in a memo they send it to CIA
and then they were kind of done with it

154
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,920
so I like I want to see the smell I want
to see these notes and they kept saying

155
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,530
it's classified it's possible I'd like
it shouldn't be classified so I file

156
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,740
what's called a freedom of information
act request

157
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,770
voya on the NSA saying show me your
notes so i filed this in march two

158
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,569
thousand ten then said okay and are you
willing to pay the search fees and I

159
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:32,180
said yes and and then they said okay I'm
we completed your search

160
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,420
you are in the first in first out
processing queue for non-personal easy

161
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,140
cases but since there were several cases
ahead of mine

162
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,620
they were unable to respond within 20
days and I said okay this is like mrs.

163
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,810
in june two thousand ten six months
later I write back and say what's going

164
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,949
on and there's always actively being
worked but it may take a while sitting

165
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,960
over six months later I went back and
say on your the final approval status ID

166
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,770
he'll push every six months i wrote to
them finally again i started this in

167
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:07,449
March 2010-2013 i get a big thick
envelope in the mail

168
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,930
what's the report and and it was the the
memo

169
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:17,079
we're going to hop forward to Admiral
student for further info and i want to

170
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,110
say this was approved for release by NSA

171
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:25,810
I'm a 21st 2013 boy pay 6119 one that's
me

172
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,140
we got that released so again

173
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:35,470
the report said that had they have not
been able to solve part 4 and and why

174
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,950
what part of it was because they just
didn't have much to go with when some

175
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:43,090
really difficult codes are solved like
the Enigma ciphers for World War two

176
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:46,990
we are solvable because we have a lot of
ciphertext work with so we're able to

177
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,190
find those kind of mathematical patterns
to take a code apart but with part 4 we

178
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,990
just have those ninety seven letters

179
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,740
so I continue researching other ways
like researching more about the artist

180
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,490
and what else he's done and i found out
that after he created cryptos who

181
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,600
created something called the untitled
cryptos piece which is sold to a private

182
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,820
collector in California so I went to
that private collector and I said I hear

183
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,330
you

184
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,380
you purchase the untitled cryptos piece
and you said yeah it's in my backyard is

185
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,220
that ok can I come and take a look at it
and said sure so i went in and i took

186
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,690
some pictures of it

187
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:28,390
so this is backyard and you can see on
one side and I'll have some better

188
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,660
pictures one side was all the texts of
crypto spent in a slightly different

189
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,589
order

190
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,710
and on the other side was a bunch of
Russian text use what's called the

191
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,610
Cyrillic alphabet right and then that
sculpture

192
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,820
there's also another version of it which
is a little bit larger which is at the

193
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,220
her short museum

194
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,530
washington d.c that's that big old
museum if you ever go to DC so you can

195
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,030
see in the top right

196
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:55,199
encrypted text there it's not in the
English alphabet the Latin alphabet it's

197
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,770
in Cyrillic it's a different alphabet
which is produced in the Soviet Union

198
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:03,030
and then another part is a little too
kind of standard alphabet were able to

199
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,520
see and understand

200
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,930
all right then I found out the russian
text was also duplicated on another of

201
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,020
Sanborn sculptures which was called the
Cyrillic projector

202
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,010
this was used for some of his art shows
in the early nineteen nineties and now

203
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:20,250
it was permanently installed at the
university of north carolina at

204
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,030
charlotte between the friday and the
fretwell buildings and there's a light

205
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:29,430
on inside of it which beams and cryptid
text all around the courtyard and we put

206
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:34,410
together a team and we crack these codes
and i'll tell you what those say another

207
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:40,589
thing i found out that on the untitled
piece on the Cyrillic side is only about

208
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:45,060
but there's really projector only has
about three quarters of the text that is

209
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,839
on the Antipodes sculpture the one
that's at the hirshhorn museum but we

210
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,460
solved all the Russian on it

211
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,790
another thing i found out that the
sections are in a different order

212
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:59,579
so in the CIA sculpture the order goes 1
2 3 4 & on the entire piece that goes

213
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:04,740
like three four one two three four one
and then it kind of chops off and also

214
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,010
on the untitled post the one that's in
this guy's backyard there's these two

215
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,540
extra dots

216
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:16,439
so again this is part three is this is
on the untitled peace and in the

217
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,770
ciphertext there's two dots

218
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,360
I'll start of . those . do not appear on
the sculpture that's what the CIA

219
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,140
headquarters

220
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,199
the letters are all the same but the
dots do not appear

221
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,540
why we don't know but it might be an
interesting hint if they were on cryptos

222
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:45,300
so what does crypto step we have the
Visionnaire table that's the other two

223
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,109
plates

224
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,710
this is what's called a polyalphabetic
substitution cipher I know in the

225
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:54,180
previous talk to her about substitution
ciphers those used a single alphabet so

226
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,109
it's called a motto alphabetic
substitution cipher visionaries a little

227
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,640
more complicated it uses multiple
alphabet so it's a polyalphabetic and

228
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,430
there's it's named after visionary who
had a different method

229
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,239
it's a little level who invented what
but hundreds of years ago this was

230
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,530
called the Shiva and this is probably
the uncrackable cipher these days with

231
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,490
computers we can usually crack it quite
quickly so the first thing that you want

232
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,600
to do is you want to make a cipher
alphabet and anybody who's going to be

233
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,750
working on the code challenge later you
want to pay attention to this

234
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,820
so when you're making a cyber alphabet
and we heard earlier about you can have

235
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,980
a method but that you also want to have
a key

236
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,060
if you change the key changes how the
code is encrypted and decrypted

237
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,940
so here you take the alphabet A through
Z and then you take your key which in

238
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,650
this case is the word cryptos you take
all the letters of cryptos out of the

239
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,819
alphabet push them off to the left and
then flush all the rest of the letters

240
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,920
to the right so you still have 26
letters but they're scrambling in a very

241
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,270
specific way

242
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,140
so long as close to me off the word
cryptos but you can also use the word

243
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:06,600
Apple could really use the word orange
you could use the word tree now tree

244
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,180
would be a little tricky because it's
got that double letter

245
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,300
prek-2 what would you do

246
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,329
how to get the other and the answer is
you would not

247
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:20,250
so you would just take T ar e and then
wash the rest up together so double

248
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,180
letters would be removed

249
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,899
clip those they're all unique letters so
you just move them all oh ok

250
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:31,720
alright so with the crypto cipher alpha
bit you can line them up

251
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,880
Kryptos show it does not

252
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,860
so cryptos put out and then you take all
of them and you shift them by what to

253
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,480
get these nice diagonals of the cues and
the Jays everybody see the diagonals

254
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,540
there and one of the advantages of this
system is you can read the word crypto

255
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,490
sin the top line but also if you read
down the left-hand column you can also

256
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,420
read the word cryptos because everything
has been shielded by exactly 1

257
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,589
so now we're going to make it even
harder instead of reading the word

258
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:09,188
cryptos down the left column we're going
to smell a different word down that

259
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:15,459
left-hand column in this case we're
going to use the word how obsessed

260
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:18,520
so we're using the crypto side for
alphabet that's our first clue

261
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:24,579
and our second key is the word policy we
find the letters for the word palace and

262
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:28,059
we move them all over to the left-hand
column and then kind of hole in the rest

263
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:31,629
and now we have this nice grid that he
was going to heat crypto sand palaces

264
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:36,700
pounds this by the way is a word for a
scroll that has had one message written

265
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,890
on it that message was then scraped off
and another message was written on the

266
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:46,090
scroll but you can still see bits of the
old mess of showing through

267
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:51,760
that's what a palimpsest is the ultimate
so part 1 of cryptos is the top two

268
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,350
lines on the sculpture there

269
00:17:53,350 --> 00:18:00,520
so the ciphertext there starts with the
letters p mu f ph z movements and using

270
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,600
the two key

271
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,699
crypto some column sets so you think I
am your PhD and we put be online

272
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,390
the new off complete take the n you go
up to the alphabet of the top and it's

273
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,289
going to be and we go up to you

274
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:28,030
w so we mus HD comes out to the letters
be e to w un between and if you keep

275
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,149
doing that then you can pull out the
entire message

276
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,150
so the ciphertext of part one is here

277
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:40,299
the keys are the words cryptos and
Palace assess and the plaintext is

278
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:45,220
between subtle shading and the absence
of light likes the new ones of illusion

279
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,150
now slide says inclusion that's not a
type on the slide

280
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,480
that's the way its carbon and sculpture
and I have standard I said was that a

281
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,690
mistake said no he says it's deliver it

282
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,200
but it's not what it is that's so
important that's where it is the

283
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,650
orientation for the positioning part 2
starts at lying three on the sculpture

284
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,260
goes down to the bottom of that plate

285
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,580
this is the ciphertext actually he did
admit that he had one mistake there was

286
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,649
a letter at the bottom that you've left
out

287
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:19,450
this uses the same method as part one
but with different keys instead of

288
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:24,130
cryptos palin says that's cryptos Absa
Absa sighs the word for an x coordinate

289
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:29,200
on a graph on the plain text is it was
totally invisible

290
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,490
how's that possible they use the Earth's
magnetic field

291
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,860
x the information was gathered and
transmitted underground to an unknown

292
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,949
location X does Langley know about this

293
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,760
they should it's buried out there
somewhere x

294
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,090
who knows the exact location only ww

295
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:55,750
this was his last message x 38 degrees
57 minutes 6.5 seconds north 77 degrees

296
00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:00,730
eight minutes 44 seconds west ID by rows
are actually thought it said id by rows

297
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,880
until he admitted there was a mistake
and what it really says extra layer 2

298
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,470
which is a benchmark a lot more
understandable i will show you where

299
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:16,870
those coordinates . - there's part 3
starts at the top of the next plate goes

300
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,939
down to about the fourth line from the
bottom

301
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,169
this is the ciphertext for part 3 now
some of you may notice that the

302
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:26,770
ciphertext looks a little different than
the ciphertext for parts one and two

303
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,370
anybody notice anything different

304
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,649
a little out yep

305
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:39,700
right the other ones had question marks
is only letter is good

306
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:45,760
anything else another thing is if you up
over there

307
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:50,500
she said anything I couldn't yet

308
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,650
yeah

309
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,700
yeah

310
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,620
what

311
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,830
she said she sees the word team

312
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:12,360
good point it looks more like English
here then the other two did because we

313
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,760
see lots of vowels in here we see ease
and a's and b's if you do a frequency

314
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,950
analysis of the English alphabet the
most commonly used letter is e followed

315
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:27,480
by team because there's a lot of odds
and there's an English so this is a

316
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,050
different method from parts one and two
parts one and two it was a

317
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,649
polyalphabetic substitution cipher this
is not substitution

318
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:38,460
this is what's called a transposition
cipher all the letters of the plain text

319
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,830
message or they're they're just
scrambled

320
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,309
so we need to figure out the method that
was used to script to scramble and then

321
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:45,540
unscramble them

322
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,750
so this is one method that i came up
with which is you take all the letters

323
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,860
from part 3

324
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,240
you line them up and then start at the
far right in the middle where that s is

325
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,850
and then count down count down by 4 1 2
3 4 wrap around the top again they'll

326
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:05,639
count down another for you get 0 W and
you keep doing that and you start

327
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,900
getting a message

328
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:11,850
slowly desperately and you get these
lovely diagonals and the entire message

329
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:17,520
comes out what it says is slowly
desperately slowing the remains of

330
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,320
passage debris that encumbered the lower
part of the doorway was removed with

331
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,580
trembling hands

332
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,559
I made a tiny breach in the upper left
hand corner and then widening the whole

333
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,480
a little i inserted the candle and . in
the hot air escaping from the chamber

334
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,250
cause the flame flickered the presently
details of the room within emerged from

335
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,090
the mist

336
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:48,000
x can you see anything q does anybody
recognize that passes i have a grown-up

337
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:56,990
any kids ok ground up and in HP
Lovecraft it

338
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:02,030
it is it is not Lovecraft but it is from
a book that was written

339
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,600
ok any other ideas

340
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,980
no telltale heart it is not fiction it's
actually from a nonfiction book

341
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:25,210
loud is it about Tutankhamun's tomb

342
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:30,580
exactly you at it this is a paraphrased
extract from the diary of the

343
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:37,540
archaeologist howard carter on the day
that he discovered King Tut's tomb and I

344
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:43,750
was november 2619 22 and the question
from can you see anything is yes

345
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:51,460
wonderful things or yes it is wonderful
so other methods for solving part three

346
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,380
is you could take the word cryptos and
it generates a numeric key one four

347
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,250
seven three six two five the way that
works is you would take all the letters

348
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:04,570
of cryptos and you would alphabetize
them and if they were alphabetized them

349
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:09,220
you would number them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and
then if you put it back the way it was

350
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,210
and bring the numbers with them you get
the key of one four seven three six two

351
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:18,130
five and if you look at my slowly
desperately slowly that's the order

352
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:25,810
comes off from Row 1 Row 4 row seven row
three row 62 and five starting with that

353
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,840
first one is one it's just another
method of doing it but it's interesting

354
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:37,060
because it lets you use the word cryptos
as the key and then there's also a

355
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,350
mathematical formula which i won't go
into the details of here and there is

356
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,100
also double kilometer transposition so
we come back to part 4 can't tell you

357
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:52,120
what it says we don't know okay we do
know that the words that the letters -

358
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,510
Krypto us are in their golden sort of
close to each other

359
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:59,920
we know that if you take everything and
put it in seven letter Rose you can and

360
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,350
you look for every letter that is
doubled

361
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,040
there's only six double letter pairs
five of them are all in the same columns

362
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,040
might be related might not the chances

363
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:15,040
statistically that you might have that
is like one in a thousand and of course

364
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,269
seven-letter Rose would be

365
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:20,169
crypto seven letters so I'm now going to
go very quickly through the Cyrillic

366
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:21,099
projector

367
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:24,968
I've already told you through some of
this how we cracked it was three steps

368
00:25:24,969 --> 00:25:28,239
we transcribe that we decrypted it and
then we translated it

369
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:31,959
we had that we have a discussion group
where we took a bunch of pictures of it

370
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:34,839
and then work from those pictures to
make a transcript which was a very

371
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:40,839
lengthy and painful process because
we're working from polaroid pictures of

372
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:45,279
russian text that was backwards on a
cylindrical sculpture

373
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,429
so we have lots of pictures and trying
to match them all

374
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:51,249
we actually have three different people
in the group all make independent

375
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:55,629
transcripts and then we compare them to
make sure we had a hyper accurate one we

376
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:58,539
worked on it for a while we didn't get
much further and then we all have like

377
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:04,149
realize to go back to use we kind of
went on and I posted this on my website

378
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:09,070
and then I got an anonymous message to
my day job is I'm a computer games and

379
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:13,029
we have a feedback form that people can
send us anonymous feedback if we want

380
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:16,209
they want for the games well one day
customer service comes over to my desk

381
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:18,999
and they say how long can we have a
message

382
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:25,389
we think it's for you and it said i have
managed to solve the cryptographic

383
00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:27,218
portion of the cipher

384
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:31,479
it is as advertised not terribly
difficult because i am doing this

385
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:34,029
anonymously because i have a sense of
humor

386
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:38,229
so I figured it was probably related to
the Cyrillic projector that it was

387
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,059
anonymous I didn't know who sent it

388
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:43,809
and then it's an interesting things
should they get credit for solving all

389
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:50,799
right and the answer is no credit will
go not to the first person to solve

390
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,539
something but the first person who can
prove that they've solved it by

391
00:26:55,539 --> 00:27:00,158
supplying enough information that an
independent party can verify it

392
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,929
it's the standard scientific method ok
it's not that you do it but can you do

393
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:08,769
it can you repeat it can someone besides
you repeat that same thing can you

394
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:10,239
communicate the method

395
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:13,719
it can't be duplicated it's probably not
real like those people of years back he

396
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:15,579
said they were cloning humans

397
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:18,119
okay great can any other lab besides

398
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:22,079
you do the same thing as what you're
doing and no one could it fell through

399
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,849
so it's just something you know if you
want credit you have to publish you have

400
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:29,158
to tell the world and you have to
communicate

401
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:33,359
I get people riding me about once a week
saying they saw a crypto sir they saw

402
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,989
one of the other unsolved codes and they
expect that I'm immediately going to get

403
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:41,429
on the phone to CNN and say hey
somebody's all of this code but no I go

404
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:45,299
back to them and say give me like the
first one with the plain text or the

405
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:49,259
last word give me something that will
prove you've done it and we can time

406
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:53,429
stamp it and then Sharon you have to
share enough of the method so that

407
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:57,299
somebody else can duplicate it and then
i'll call CNN but so far no one's done

408
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,039
it right

409
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,839
so this what happened with the surly
projector and again i'm going to be kind

410
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,139
of speeding through this is that i was
reading my weblog is one day because I'm

411
00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:10,918
interested in who links to my website
and i saw a really interesting link

412
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:12,839
which was home daughter think that net

413
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:16,799
somebody's name CP solution that hdmi
that CP solution that's really

414
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:22,649
intriguing URL and I when I found myself
was obviously a visionary table and the

415
00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:26,998
anonymous solver have been creating this
page that they were going to pull it out

416
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:30,629
on the world and kind of give us another
hint about what they've done but what

417
00:28:30,629 --> 00:28:34,438
they didn't know is that a pop they said
that transcription is here

418
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:38,519
they link to my site as soon as they
link to my site I could go back and see

419
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:41,669
where their website was it was an
earthquake site which had their main in

420
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:45,719
the URL so immediately I could get their
email address and go back and write to

421
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:50,819
them and say hey congrats you know what
does it say there's a long not sure then

422
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:56,039
had solved the cryptographic thing but
it came up with a mushroom russian text

423
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,359
that they couldn't read

424
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:01,259
so now the race was on we had a method
we had a mushroom russian text but we

425
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:04,829
didn't have a plain text yet so we're
like reaching out the IRC and trying to

426
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:08,009
find someone who can translate this
Russian forest

427
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:12,809
does anybody here speak Russian ok if
you don't speak Russian

428
00:29:13,469 --> 00:29:17,339
this is really hard to read because it's
it smashed together there's no word

429
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:20,819
breaks their spelling errors here isn't
this is not the plain text but this is

430
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:21,840
an example of

431
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,149
the problem this sentence might be
easily understandable to a native

432
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:31,230
English speaker that someone not
familiar with English would have a great

433
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,640
deal of trouble reading or translating
it plus the fact that there isn't any

434
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,919
punctuation isn't any help either

435
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,820
we can read this is where native English
speaker someone is not a native English

436
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:47,370
speaker probably would not be able to
read that we did finally find a native

437
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:52,049
speaker was about to tell us came out to
the extracts from classified KGB

438
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:53,158
documents

439
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:57,270
I won't go and read all of it but we did
find out that they're going to Soviet

440
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:01,139
defector that had brought a bunch of
classified KGB . and we found one of

441
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,460
them and part of the ceramic projector
came from the top of this memo it was a

442
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,500
KGB memo from 1982 about the Soviet
dissidents soccer of and concerns that

443
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,480
his comments at the pub wash conference
we're going to be used by the Americans

444
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,559
for an anti-soviet agenda so they were
debating getting rid of them

445
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:24,510
and this is the criminal secret it was
classified so getting back to cryptos

446
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,640
the latitude/longitude coordinates

447
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,020
I'll speed through this so this that
white building with the funny-shaped

448
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,370
roof does the cafeteria between the
original headquarters building in the

449
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:39,090
new headquarters building as the new
headquarters building there on the left

450
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,350
was being built

451
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:44,668
they had a courtyard there so that from
the cafeteria there's a line of windows

452
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:47,909
the CIA employees can look out the
windows see this courtyard

453
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:50,909
Kryptos

454
00:30:52,999 --> 00:31:02,479
there's also a duck pond there and some
other slides the artist also like here's

455
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:07,819
another view and he be honest also did
some slabs out front that have Morse

456
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:13,639
code messages in them these so things
like SOS shadow forces loosen memory t

457
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:16,938
is your position on the cum challenge
that i'll be getting you later I'll show

458
00:31:16,939 --> 00:31:22,399
you the other Morse code messages if you
want to translate them so the

459
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:29,178
coordinates from part 2 we believe
points to an area in the courtyard about

460
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,999
a hundred and fifty feet southeast of
the sculpture

461
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:35,359
we've been there there's nothing there
there's lunch tables that could be like

462
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:40,609
drag around but it's possible that it's
not within the courtyard remember that X

463
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:44,629
layer to see is actually a series of
levels there might be something at a

464
00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:49,639
lower level but again we don't know how
but also we discovered about cryptos

465
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:53,899
there's an extra L on the Visionnaire
terrible side and down the right-hand

466
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:54,619
column

467
00:31:54,619 --> 00:32:00,259
it should be identical to the alphabet
should go f g h i j l and politico's e f

468
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:07,099
g h i ll so to the lines and without why
we don't know it's possible that Sanborn

469
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:10,968
was trying to draw the eye to that line
as a way of giving a hint

470
00:32:10,969 --> 00:32:14,029
he sort of did this with the Cyrillic
projectors really projector was a

471
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:20,089
visionary system Holly alphabetic but
use the keywords of 10 and Medusa 10 is

472
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:22,069
the word for shadow darkness

473
00:32:22,069 --> 00:32:29,209
Medusa the mythological creature or the
jellyfish and if you look at the words

474
00:32:29,209 --> 00:32:32,209
that are being beamed out for the
sculpture

475
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:44,500
that word Medusa's in the Latin alphabet
not in the Cyrillic alphabet there is no

476
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,190
s in the Cyrillic alphabet there is no d
at least not written like that

477
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:53,049
so where does that were introduced to
come from on the sculpture it goes from

478
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:55,660
the third line up from the bottom of the
plate

479
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:59,080
well if you go in the daylight and you
look at that plate the red line up

480
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,309
there's actually an extra Bible on that
line it's a little hard to see here but

481
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:06,100
if you look from the other side and
sculpture it's really obvious there's a

482
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:11,168
bolt they're only but like that on the
sculpture so it's possible that Sanborn

483
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:15,100
put that bolt there is a way of saying
hey there's a hint here look at it

484
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:20,049
so shy

485
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:24,789
I talked to him as well I'll be seeing
him again later this year and he said he

486
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:33,850
did things to mask the English in part
for you said we cannot solve it by

487
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:37,330
waiting the English language said the
first three parts were solved with the

488
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:41,949
advantages of the English language we
knew like vowels and double letters and

489
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:45,250
the frequency he said we removed that
advantage for part 4

490
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,500
so he said the first thing we need to do
for part 4 is figure out the masking

491
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,140
technique that was used

492
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:56,200
not sure what it means but i'm sharing
it with you guys he said he used a

493
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,730
little bit of stego steganography which
is way of hiding a message but he have

494
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:04,809
said that it is in English that they
didn't put it in ancient Ethiopian or

495
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:09,159
order or something he says it isn't an
English plain text and he says it uses

496
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,450
all the letters

497
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:16,178
so it's like we just remove some of the
letters that are unneeded now

498
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:21,250
sanborn give us a hint he said in 2010
you said i'll give you one of the words

499
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,989
that word is Berlin

500
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:27,819
so where it says NY pvt that's the word
Berlin the city brewing

501
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:32,260
so big flurry of activity international
news especially in Germany wondering why

502
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:36,820
the word Bruins on the sculpture at the
Senators think of CIA headquarters and

503
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,970
we did find that we can get the word
going to show up there with a

504
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:42,310
polyalphabetic system with if we use the

505
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:46,540
keys of shifted and binary Berlin pops
right up

506
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,890
but we don't get anything intelligible
before or after it also we can use lots

507
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:55,299
of other keys that will also generate
the word berlin at exactly that location

508
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,450
but nothing intelligible before after

509
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:01,899
so sad and boring over and we also said
okay well as a pearl and there's a

510
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,160
number of Link's you know there is amber
line there's other ways that women could

511
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,180
be there but sam rosen know that means
brilliant means the city

512
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:13,690
he said that all 4 parts of crypto so
important and he said he'd give another

513
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,190
clue in 10 years

514
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:19,600
well he did give another clue in 2014

515
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,630
where he said ok right afterwards says
Berlin

516
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:27,040
there's MZ fpk so that's the word clock
in clock

517
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:31,660
so now we have about ten percent of the
plane tix report for we still haven't

518
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:36,940
solved the thing i don't know i'm
eagerly awaiting the next clue

519
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,040
it's just a few other things we noticed
about it part 3 there are a few letters

520
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,660
that are slightly out of alignment and
see those letters why A&R and that when

521
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,230
I should decide the same morning said
it's important we don't know why

522
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:55,240
also something interesting you said as i
showed in one of the slides and usually

523
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,959
the picture of crypto that was used was
the one at the top left and he said

524
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,350
don't use that one it's from the wrong
side

525
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:06,910
that one's ugly I said what does that
mean what do you mean what what picture

526
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:10,839
do you want he wanted the one that was
down at the bottom right is that that's

527
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,100
the way to look at it

528
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:20,799
that's the front ok and a little bit
more about Berlin

529
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,810
possibly he's referring to the berlin
wall which was falling the anybody of

530
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,470
the kids have you heard of the berlin
wall or the fall of the room

531
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:32,160
wall okay good so that was following
right around the time that he was

532
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,140
carving the sculpture and so and some of
the pieces of the brew in wall were then

533
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:41,759
shipped to the CIA where there's a
monument at CIA to the bruin wall and

534
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,000
that was the plans for that were being
done right around the same time that Sam

535
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,500
was creating a sculpture

536
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,599
so it's possible that he was referring
to this in part 4 we don't know the

537
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,950
coordinates which point to the central
courtyard are possibly wear that

538
00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:04,740
monument was going to be in actuality
it's going on here but this is all just

539
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:09,810
just fearing so there's no heart for
don't know what it says

540
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,900
one other thing about the the brewing
wall before anybody gets too excited

541
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:20,040
about the the graffiti that is not
original graffiti from the Berlin Wall

542
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:25,800
the CIA received blanks labs and then
hired an artist to paint fake or Fiji on

543
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,070
the slabs to make it look like it was
from the building like just thought I

544
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:29,580
tossed them

545
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:34,348
ok so anyone has made many other
sculptures I have a lot of this

546
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:39,480
information on my website he's done a
lot with binary and asking like there's

547
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,630
the sculpture on the right from the
University of Connecticut

548
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:46,440
so there's use the other ones and zeros
that are being projected the bet the

549
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,180
circular bench there is that

550
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:53,009
martinsburg at the internal revenue
service center and then just another fun

551
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:58,020
thing to the kids

552
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,230
how many of you have heard of this book
davinci code

553
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,560
ok grown-ups davinci code right

554
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,599
dan brown um there are five puzzles that
are hidden in the artwork of the book

555
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,290
jacket

556
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:13,680
dan Brown does this because he's giving
clues about the subject of his next

557
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,580
novel

558
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,720
two of the puzzles in this book jacket
of da Vinci Code refer to crypt us

559
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,160
believe it or not now because it was a
clue that was next book was going to be

560
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:29,520
about Washington DC so on the back of
the book there's a fake terror and then

561
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,650
there it says only WWE

562
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:35,880
those referring to that part too and I
don't know if you can see it in this

563
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,200
light

564
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:44,339
but along the left like red I'm dark red
or a series of numbers 37 degrees 57

565
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:50,520
minutes 6.5 seconds north 77 degrees
eight minutes 44 seconds west referring

566
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:56,460
again to part 2 encrypted so they were
referring to Washington's just sequel of

567
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,390
the davinci code called the lost symbol
which features crypto says the theme

568
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,620
throughout the novel

569
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:05,790
I actually helped dan brown with the
research for the novel he called me up

570
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:09,180
and say is anything you have been
discovered about cryptos and in thanks

571
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,970
one of the characters in this book is
named after me

572
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:15,839
my name is lanka there's a character
named nola k which is a scrambled

573
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:21,870
version of Lanka so summery cryptos and
has four codes on it

574
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:25,560
three of the four and solve for that has
not been solved yet why hasn't been

575
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,200
solved well one is very short

576
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,279
we generally don't need a lot more side
for text to work with it may be messed

577
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:32,700
up

578
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:38,009
he made a mistake but he's reviewing a
pretty thoroughly by this point it's

579
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:41,250
also possible there's a clue on CIA
grounds and encrypt this was never

580
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,910
designed as a public challenge it was
designed as it was designed as a

581
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,220
challenge to the employees at the CIA

582
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,040
so maybe there's something on the
grounds of the CIA that we just don't

583
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,790
have access to as possible we were
misdirected and shy

584
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:57,990
let's and one in China have said that
the answers in English maybe it's in

585
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:04,350
French or Egyptian or Ethiopian or maybe
when Sanborn said the plaintext we have

586
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,670
Berlin clock

587
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,150
maybe it doesn't really say blue in
there maybe he's just telling is that to

588
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:13,260
cut to try and throw us off the set but
they have bumps said that it is solvable

589
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,950
my own girl people simply long one so
cryptic as I say no I

590
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:21,299
wanna see it solved so if i can help see
it solved by sharing as much information

591
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,400
as I can with other people

592
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,400
that's what i'm going to do if you want
more information

593
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,040
I do have a book which you can get on
amazon for probably like a buck now

594
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,849
secret codes and cryptograms there's a
chapter in there

595
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:41,040
i'm also going to be giving another talk
about cryptos at the freaknik hacker con

596
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,359
and nashville we think is now in its
nineteen year that will be november 637

597
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,029
you can go online

598
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:52,410
my website is you wanna calm / cryptos
there's a yahoo group you can join the

599
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:52,980
discussion

600
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,880
anybody can join the discussion even
kids all you got to do is send an email

601
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,210
to cryptos - subscribe yahoogroups com

602
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:04,260
and I want lots of ideas but i think
it's going to be lots of ideas that get

603
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,520
this thing solved

604
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,030
there's documentaries there's what I
know that of course you can just google

605
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,980
and there's more information out there

606
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,650
there's also this book called secrets of
the Lost Symbol there's a couple

607
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:19,020
articles in there with much more
information about cryptos and any

608
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,329
questions

609
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:24,329
yes

610
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:37,400
yeah is it possible that it's been
solved and whoever solved it just didn't

611
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,960
want to say the solution

612
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,850
um it's possible i act like i said i get
people ready to me once a week thing

613
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:47,810
they've solved it but they're not going
to tell me but I think now they did they

614
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:51,049
didn't solve it they just want the
attention

615
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:55,730
most often people ask they say look
someone at the NSA must have solved this

616
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,520
by this point and i don't think so

617
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,110
I i organize a dinner like every couple
years where anybody was working on

618
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:06,410
cryptos can come in and can meet Jim
Sanborn me Ted shy

619
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:10,910
we have some NSA people come out last
time and I believe that someone at NSA

620
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,060
it solved that someone would be coming
up to me one of these centers of my

621
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,410
badge not J

622
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:20,330
nobody's all leather no but now instead
they're like Angry there I pissed off

623
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:24,259
that it hasn't been solved yet so I
don't believe anyone is solved it and

624
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,560
and no one has ever given me any reason
to think that it might have been solved

625
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:34,460
any other questions yes

626
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:38,690
yeah

627
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,170
yeah

628
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,880
ok

629
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,809
and the question was is the code
publicly accessible the the text is

630
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:50,319
definitely accessible online and has
been published in various cryptography

631
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,279
magazines

632
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:56,619
the sculpture is not publicly accessible
I do have contacts in the CIA and a

633
00:42:56,619 --> 00:43:00,549
right to be kind of an honestly and say
what do you want me to go look at and I

634
00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:06,130
said go look under this lab or I asked
one to measure the thickness of the slab

635
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:10,329
and he didn't want to get in trouble so
what he did is he took from an aluminum

636
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:14,589
gum wrapper and he went out there on his
lunch break and he quietly put the

637
00:43:14,589 --> 00:43:18,339
rapper up against the the sculpture and
kind of priest it and then put it in his

638
00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:21,549
pocket and then he went back to his
office so you can measure with the

639
00:43:21,549 --> 00:43:25,538
thickness of the slab was and then send
me the information so so we've got

640
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:28,990
people that are looking but so far
nothing interested in coming out of it

641
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:33,700
any other questions you like i said i'm
going to be here for a while on the

642
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:37,689
workshop got the school crypto challenge
here and anybody else has any questions

643
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,970
you're welcome to come up at any time

644
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:40,569
thank you for listening
