what you see when you browse the web or

there and collect what you're doing on

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,630
the web so they just sit there and they

26

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be there in which we'll talk</font>

31
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,900
about in a moment

32
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,479
ISPs are very important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attacks like</font>

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,100
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because of that governments</font>

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:31,320
like to have very strong relationships

35
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:33,298
with ISPs<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what is a nice p is p is a</font>

36
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">is your internet service provider so</font>

37
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,890
they take you send<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to</font>

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,320
google.com and it figures out where that

39
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,390
is and it takes you there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it returns</font>

40
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,839
everything and it gets all your requests

41
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,000
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so why do they do this they do</font>

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,250
this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs are in a very</font>

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,670
interesting position because they are

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:57,090
between you and where you want to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:00,990
illustrate this<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have what i have an</font>

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:04,710
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> so now back to my original demo</font>

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">listened to and that's somewhat</font>

51
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:16,220
interesting information for government

52
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:20,420
like and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and governments</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

53
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">click this from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time to time and use it</font>

54
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,869
to learn about people and as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

55
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">imagine if you watch all of someone's</font>

56
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,260
traffic for days or even years<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

57
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,849
learn a tremendous amount of information

58
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,739
about them

59
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:33,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">additionally you can also see everywhere</font>

60
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:41,690
they go on the internet so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I go to</font>

61
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:43,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">my website as you can see ok</font>

62
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,349
it shows my<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic but anyways you can</font>

63
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,720
inject things into the browser and

64
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:49,970
that's that's one of the reasons that

65
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,590
the position of an<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very important</font>

66
00:02:49,970 --> 00:03:01,010
to someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do mass</font>

67
00:02:51,590 --> 00:03:05,599
surveillance

68
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:07,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">so anyways moving on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so just to recap</font>

69
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,780
the position of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isp is important</font>

70
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,250
because you can see everything that

71
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,409
someone does and you can inject stuff

72
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,459
into what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> see you can both see what</font>

73
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:20,179
they see and you can change what they

74
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:22,730
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> ID so one example of this happening</font>

75
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,620
is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that done by GCHQ which is</font>

a<font color="#CCCCCC"> British</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> intelligence agency and that</font>

everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> users did try to figure</font>

out who they were and what they did

as a way of getting useful analytics so

00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:02,120
how they do it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> two words and they're</font>

00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:18,228
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font>

97
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,449
infections happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> generally on a mass</font>

scale and generally only<font color="#E5E5E5"> by very corrupt</font>

00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:26,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">government so Syria and other people</font>

100
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:29,090
that are trying to maintain control

101
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:32,090
their citizens so this and it becomes

102
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:34,130
very scary<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they will use them for</font>

103
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:38,150
so generally it's used for more enhanced

104
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:41,870
data gathering<font color="#E5E5E5"> so things like how you</font>

105
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:44,150
can you can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone's passwords</font>

106
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,820
with something called the keychain<font color="#CCCCCC"> dumb</font>

107
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:50,570
so what that does on<font color="#CCCCCC"> OS X is it allows</font>

108
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:53,120
for an attacker to get all the users

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:47,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">but yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so these are a</font>

122
00:05:44,880 --> 00:06:02,350
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> exploits for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> older versions of</font>

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:14,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i run it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will show a page</font>

but basically what it would do is it

127
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,550
would allow me to when it that machine

access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the page it would allow me to</font>

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,440
control that computer and make it do

130
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,880
whatever I wanted to and that is

131
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,350
something the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been known</font>
