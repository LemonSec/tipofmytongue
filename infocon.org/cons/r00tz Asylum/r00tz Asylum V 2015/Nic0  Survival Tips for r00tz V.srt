1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,870
silent talk about a couple things here
really quickly which is essentially

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:13,139
there's a set of safety tips that we
give to everyone coming into routes

3
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,460
especially people that are there for the
first time at DEFCON and so I'm gonna go

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,010
over a couple of them really quick and
just give you a couple examples and and

5
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:27,519
what we're doing and why so the first
one is essentially if you've got any a

6
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,390
pass for or credit cards with the chip
in it and RFID chip that can easily be

7
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,550
cloned so you want to keep that in a
Faraday cage a Faraday cage essentially

8
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,110
a metal cage that isn't going to let out
any wireless signals were gonna teach

9
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,390
you how to make those here got some
fancy ones but essentially what you can

10
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:53,739
do as well is used tin foil and then put
it in a plastic bag and and that works

11
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:57,589
really well too but pretty much any
wireless connection that you're sending

12
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:04,309
off could be a danger even though your
keycard also has a magnetic strip on it

13
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:09,210
so someone can sniff that from afar but
they can come up in bump you and then

14
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,350
clone your key card and get all the
information off of that to do you want

15
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,600
to be really careful with any devices or
information that you're bringing in here

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:26,199
so that was the key card next one bad
things so it's really important to you

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,799
to look at your phone and turn off
Bluetooth and WiFi and your geolocation

18
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,229
I'm you'll notice to when you do an app
update on your phone though usually turn

19
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,439
those back on C want to check them
pretty often but all of those can be

20
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:49,360
sniffed even from far away with blue too
and also to also the wifi here I don't

21
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,250
ever use wifi when I travel at a hotel
but specially not DEFCON unless you

22
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,990
really know what you're doing because
it's a playground people are getting on

23
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,298
the wifi and they're here to hack so
you're ready to get into that playground

24
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:07,020
go ahead and do it but I'm is probably
the most hostile WiFi network in the

25
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,530
world I'm your cellular connection is a
lot safer than a wireless can I

26
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,240
action first of all it's harder to hack
but it's also a lot more illegal to hack

27
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,970
so I think your your cell connection if
you must connect is gonna be safer so I

28
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,990
carry around a MiFi with me instead of
using wifi whenever I travel places but

29
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,690
I have to connect to any WiFi network
and a VPN won't stop you from

30
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,989
you'll still get bugs if I using a VPN
on wifi so that's not gonna be good

31
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:43,620
enough especially here so am i fires
just essentially like a hot spot it's a

32
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,430
little device that you can get from one
of the carriers like AT&T or a partner

33
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,800
and it connects your phone and you can
send data through there and you usually

34
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,550
can get a little better data plan that
way then if you're using a hot spot on

35
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:06,769
your phone so if you are checking email
here make sure that you're using SSL

36
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,230
that you're not sending your passwords
in the clear how many have you heard of

37
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,799
the wall of sheep alright great we had
them here a little bit before and on

38
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,220
Sunday they're gonna keep their wall of
sheep in the main DEFCON open for us to

39
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,690
go over there that anyone wants to learn
how to do this but if you are sending

40
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:29,109
your password in the clear your password
and username will go up on a wall for

41
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:34,160
everybody here to see if the conference
now why would we do that because it's an

42
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,400
educational conference and we're trying
to show you that you're sending your

43
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,250
your your information in the clear we do

44
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:45,230
obfuscated a couple of the numbers are
numbers or letters in the password so

45
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:51,399
not can you not completely but something
to watch out for and I suggest that's a

46
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,700
great thing for all of you to go visit
it sometime while you're here so cover

47
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:04,630
the front front facing your inner facing
camera on your laptop your phone your

48
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:09,650
Smart TV two years ago we should all of
you how to turn on the inner facing

49
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,310
camera and microphone on your TV

50
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,140
this is an attack that happens quite a
bit extortion is becoming mainstream I

51
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,740
mainly see it with reporters these days
it's being used quite a bit but I think

52
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,530
for everyone you know but I ever seen

53
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:32,099
facing camera looking at me ICICI ball
looking so just be aware of that and you

54
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,860
can just use electrical tape to cover it
and we've also got some removable

55
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:42,580
stickers but electrical tape or so also
if you see a phone charger around and

56
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,349
you really need to charge your phone
don't do it I we have fake photo

57
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,850
archer's all over the place here and
when you plug into one of these we can

58
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:57,140
get all of your data off your phone now
DEFCON we have more of these unusual but

59
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,120
these exist all over the places people
are putting them up to get data off

60
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,150
phone so only charge your phone with
your own with your own device and

61
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:16,500
electrical connection use cash only I
suggest the ATMs here too I don't

62
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,100
recommend them often they are fake ATM
that are brought in did you know that

63
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:28,200
you can buy an ATM on on eBay and
install it so a few years ago I haven't

64
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,039
seen a couple years but we found one a
few years ago I fake ATM that was the

65
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,590
stalled you know everyone's put their
foot in their information in and it was

66
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,960
it was pretty awesome because it was
right next to the security office at the

67
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,780
hotel

68
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,469
why do you think it was there it was the
one blind spot where all the cameras

69
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:54,360
they couldn't see it so ATM fake ATMs do
exist they exist all over the world but

70
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,800
here you're going to find the more than
anywhere so I suggest using cash

71
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:04,300
everywhere but don't use the ATM so go
somewhere else and get get your money

72
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,880
encrypt your hard drive and make sure
your phone got a password on it if you

73
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,100
do lose your your computer or your phone
you want to make sure that it's still

74
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:19,820
hard to get into assuming your room is
bugged and all rooms are bad now a lot

75
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,039
of people say okay Nico you're really
paranoid here I mean I don't think

76
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,310
that's really the case I so last year we
bought a bug finder and we found two

77
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,690
bugs in our suite it's really happening
it's probably and there's probably not

78
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,689
just one bag in your suite there's
probably numerous

79
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:41,699
agencies organizations have bugs all
over we are in a new hotel this year so

80
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,709
it takes a little while to get it bugged
but just assume you have no privacy

81
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:51,269
pretty much anywhere including a room
and another interesting point there is

82
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:56,969
in the shower they usually have bugs in
the shower why is that not because

83
00:06:56,969 --> 00:07:02,329
they're pervs know people go into the
shower top secret conversations because

84
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:06,949
the white noise people that know that
there's bugs out now they bought the

85
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:22,209
showers to assume that anything you do
or buy in your room can be seen by

86
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:25,479
everyone I mean might have remember two
years ago when major showed us how to

87
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:30,029
hack into the hotel system but
everything there is pretty much public

88
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:37,499
for anyone to see I suggest changing
your passwords both before the events

89
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:41,089
where little late there now but after
the vent too soon as you get home change

90
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:44,449
all of your passwords as well and we
will talk a little bit about how to how

91
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:46,679
to fix a passwords little bit later on
today

92
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:52,409
wealth little too late for you guys that
already came here but you know have you

93
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:56,879
noticed that they don't send kids and
pilots for the sniffers and hackers

94
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,649
don't go through them either it's not
that big of a deal but the database can

95
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:07,619
be hacked and there's some information
there you probably don't want out so I

96
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:13,099
get a massage every time I go through
TSA assume someone is always looking

97
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:17,669
over your shoulder this is a hacking
event whenever i type my password I do

98
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:21,799
with my wall to the back or have a
privacy screen people are watching you

99
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:28,739
you're not paranoid don't trust people
by default

100
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:36,360
social engineering is a big part of
DEFCON and and so this is a place where

101
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,818
you kind of allowed to lie for fun
sometimes in good ways it's part of the

102
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:47,589
game here so don't take anything at face
value

103
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:53,710
and tinfoil hats make friends I'm in tin
foil works for wireless signals I think

104
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:58,720
there might be something to the tinfoil
hats I'm you might see several usually

105
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,120
couple attendees at DEFCON that we're
only tinfoil you may see them around
