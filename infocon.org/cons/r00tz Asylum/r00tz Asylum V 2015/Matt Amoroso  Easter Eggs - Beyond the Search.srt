1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,509
has already doing music video games are
games out there were actually already

2
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:12,130
the game development booth and I have
you got a chance to go over there but

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:18,660
you can go there make some around levels
it's good time so my name's marrow so

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,859
computer science major at Lehigh
University the co-founder of time reach

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:33,190
reductions and and to teaching talked
about Easter eggs so you don't know

6
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:40,649
anything I guess it's a like a hidden
feature in most mostly in software but

7
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,809
not limited to it and it's it's usually
like a little hidden message or a hidden

8
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,468
feature like for those of you who have
used Microsoft Excel you know there's a

9
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:54,460
flight simulator hidden in the program
that's a perfect example of an easter

10
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:54,800
egg

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:04,750
so anyway what is really to hacking they
actually share a lot of the same

12
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,850
concepts in the sense that and he's
doing takes a little more thought and

13
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:16,580
effort on the part of the user directly
access and see what these derek is so

14
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,658
what I'm gonna do as I may take you
through some examples of some Easter

15
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:23,979
eggs and video games and television and
we're gonna look at how they've been

16
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:27,830
used for different purposes over the
years and kinda where they come from

17
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:33,740
in some cases a particularly sneaky
easter egg or a forgetful programmer can

18
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:39,850
actually cause a easter egg to pass
their product testing on scene which as

19
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,369
any hacker nose is a potential security
vulnerability for the software in

20
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:51,079
question so officials are going to talk
about is from again called adventure on

21
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:57,740
the Atari 2600 which I'm guessing you
can't really don't know what that is but

22
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,500
that's a very early game console

23
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,320
and this is a very early on sides
growing middle game where you move a

24
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:14,000
cube around so atari this time didn't
actually allow the programmers to put

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,910
credit in the game and take credit for
the work that they did so this guy

26
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,690
Warren Robinette who worked on adventure
decided he was going to put an Easter

27
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:30,040
egg in his game and it was it's rarely
considered the first Easter egg in a

28
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,250
video game ever and it's him you just
get this little cube somewhere early on

29
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,720
the game he carried through to the end
and his name appears at the end

30
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,880
kind of like you know what I told him he
couldn't do it he did it anyway that's a

31
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:52,350
pretty hackery start to Easter eggs and
gaming if you ask me so I can talk about

32
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,850
some game called halo 2 I hope everyone
knows that that is one of my favorite

33
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:03,870
games of all time to talk about the
Scarab gun easter egg which is actually

34
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,080
just a normal guy and they can pick up
their very complicated series of tasks

35
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,870
that you have to do in one of the levels
to shoot the same cannon blast as one of

36
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:20,290
the giant tank enemies in the game and
this is a perfect example and he's just

37
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,540
being used

38
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,970
just a little bit of fun to the game but
this one particularly is very very hard

39
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:33,170
to access it's not just glaring in the
face you do a whole bunch of stuff just

40
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,670
to be able to experience it but it is
well worth it if you if you have the

41
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,839
time to do that

42
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,400
boil and still this game honestly has
more Easter eggs in it than it has game

43
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,070
content it's just chocolate Easter eggs
and much like Halo that I just talked

44
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,790
about the Easter eggs are generally just
for fun

45
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,410
their pop culture references reference
to other game things like that

46
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:06,900
that but they're much much easier to
find and access than the one I talked

47
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,540
about a lot too and that's because the
developers of the game actually decided

48
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,750
consciously that they're going to make
the easiest part of the gaming

49
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,769
experience that a player would naturally
come across them and see them in the

50
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:26,700
environment and just add to the fun of
the game Halo ODST and I'm favoring halo

51
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,390
little bit but a great game so we
haven't played it doesn't go play Halo

52
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:38,550
but Halo ODST came out in 2009 at that
time bungee had not announced any news

53
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,290
about the game at they're working on
which is destiny which came out in

54
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,230
September of 2014

55
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:53,080
so that's five years before it was the
first mention of it as an Easter their

56
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,280
official announcement of their
partnership with Activision and working

57
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,989
on the game came two years after the
actually is there and it was a very very

58
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,720
successful way of building up hype for
the game before the announcement showed

59
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,460
up so this is a great example of
Bungie's an Easter egg as kind of a

60
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:18,430
little homage to a future game that's
coming out I'm very very same concept as

61
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,870
the budget thing but they they messed it
up a little bit so they developers a

62
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:31,870
naughty dog they planned on releasing
uncharted 3 actually after they had

63
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,669
announced their new game The Last of Us
so they put this little Easter again the

64
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,820
newspapers like a little information
about the game and so that everyone knew

65
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,650
naughty dog was working on a new title
but no one knew anything about it

66
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,219
and 103 actually ended up getting
released before they announced last the

67
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,240
rest they totally forgot to take out the
little my Easter egg in the newspaper

68
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,190
and some clever gamers put two and two
together and suddenly you know all this

69
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,580
information about the last of us before
the announcement

70
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:09,800
Metal Gear Solid another classic game
other plastic Easter eggs in this boss

71
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,729
fight against Psycho Mantis you would
write oh man he would actually reference

72
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:20,039
games that you have played before
somehow and players or this was you know

73
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,659
it was it was new it was surprising it
was very cool but he would just read

74
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,449
your memory card in your Playstation and
those were simpler times where your

75
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:33,830
memory card wasn't all that private like
you didn't really care if anyone reads

76
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:39,969
in memory card but nowadays it became
incorporated something like this

77
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:45,060
have some malicious game developer
decided to put in a feature that can

78
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,460
actually read the data from your console
or computer it as an Easter eggs ok past

79
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,638
your product testing they could actually
get a lot of information you might not

80
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,470
want them to have you know it's just an
example of how an Easter egg could

81
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,400
potentially be a security vulnerability
if not completely product tested and

82
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,900
everything so we only talked about video
games doing so far but my favorite show

83
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:17,109
is scrubs anyone's ever watched it so
this easter egg i think is just one

84
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:23,060
that's a little bit funny it's a little
bit comical the surgeon turkey changes

85
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:30,570
his number one episode 2 1961 916
Coulter and if you actually call that

86
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:35,240
number it'll go to like a scrubs phone
and while they were filming they had the

87
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,270
phone on set and sometimes people pick
it up so you know this isn't a security

88
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,049
vulnerability but more just something
that kind of fun and creative

89
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:51,060
the part of the developers of the show
now the TV show Archer very good show

90
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:57,770
kids don't watch it without asking your
parents permission so particularly

91
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:04,310
eagle-eyed viewer happened to catch in
all of the episodes that one of the

92
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:10,039
computers had a hex code on the screen
so when you translate this tax code and

93
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:16,719
actually leads to a YouTube video URL
and then the YouTube videos some sound

94
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:21,490
wave that makes no sense but if you play
the sound wave through a sonogram that

95
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:28,139
actually leads to a venir cipher that
you can actually equipped and then that

96
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:32,269
leads to a Craigslist ad that has
another cypher on it that leads to a

97
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:36,828
reddit page that leads to a Flickr
account and finally it leads to this

98
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:42,328
webpage algiers often that which is the
personal webpage of like the mad

99
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:47,849
scientist guy on the show and it's you
know it's just a little information on

100
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,270
there is still stuff on that page that
people haven't figured out how to access

101
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:56,199
so it's just a really good example of
the makers of the show putting a lot of

102
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:02,360
time and effort into this easter egg as
a really good example of that so we'll

103
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,399
ask these are going to talk about is a
problem I don't know if anyone has ever

104
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:16,020
done any PHP working probably recognize
it but the PHP picture is there a few

105
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,279
add that little thing in the bottom to
the end of a URL on a site that uses PHP

106
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:28,720
it'll come up with one of these pictures
and luckily in years past they've

107
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,079
actually changed it so that will only
happen if the developer decides to make

108
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:42,760
PHP visible but this is very obvious
reasons could be a very very overlooked

109
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,800
security vulnerability fair a developer
of a site you may want to hide the fact

110
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,349
that they're using PHP

111
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:56,590
and for whatever reason if some attacker
has a specific attack that works against

112
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:01,840
web site using PHP and the developers
had forgotten to make this hidden they

113
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,220
could just add this to the end of the
URL and find out if they're using PHP

114
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,590
immediately do their attack and do
whatever they want to the website so

115
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:17,920
luckily the PHP developers thought this
and did not have that but it's very

116
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,849
possible that they could have happened
and you can see now how easter eggs

117
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:28,370
really need to be brought about and
thought through on how we're gonna do

118
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:32,530
with them had them into our game have
been to a TV show whatever makes it a

119
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:36,240
security vulnerability to make sure
they're fun they're interesting whether

120
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,290
they want to be part of the game like
Borderlands or just a hidden thing that

121
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:46,020
the developers have to make a video
showing how to do like in Halo but you

122
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:54,449
know I really like video games like
Easter eggs at all I have for you if you

123
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:59,170
wanna ask me questions are coming over
booth video game development booth once

124
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,810
again my name is Matt tomorrow so you
can subscribe to my YouTube channel and

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,229
check out my website to see information
on courses in game development illness

126
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:13,120
