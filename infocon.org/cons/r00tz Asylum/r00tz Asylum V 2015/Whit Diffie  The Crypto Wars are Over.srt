1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,929
my situation report on the trip because
they aren't over there will never be oh

2
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:14,750
we are in a stage of human history what
we doing something that hasn't been done

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:21,279
in five or seven thousand years seven
thousand years ago we began to move into

4
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:28,550
city and for the first time people could
really good fraction of their lives amid

5
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:34,309
you omit things built by human beings we
get to the point of modern city you

6
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:40,250
could not actually walk on on the ground
you could not go very long time slot

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,180
being outdoors you can be an air
conditioning etc

8
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,019
things that will matter of natural law
became matters of human policy

9
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:56,680
convenience decision and now we're doing
it again we are moving our culture as

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,579
rapidly as the venture capitalists will
lend us the money we are moving it into

11
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:10,299
into cyberspace and who controls
cyberspace is going to be a major aspect

12
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:12,030
of

13
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:28,280
of the next so what are the crypt awards
as they stand at the moment it's allowed

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:37,530
by the FBI various other people that
they should have a right maybe with a

15
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,500
court order to get access to any
information that you that you have

16
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,110
outside of your head and so they get
your cell phone

17
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,409
they want to be sure that they can so to
speak pry it open and see what senate

18
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,619
get your communications they want to be
sure that they can't be gripped it in

19
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:03,479
such a way that they can and they have
been lobbying for something that we on

20
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,819
the other side of this considered very
dangerous which is a set of back doors

21
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:14,630
cracked or sometimes the ball towards
the formal formal garden at the moment

22
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:21,120
this exceptional access

23
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:31,230
I mean I think we're clearing out right
now but the most pleasing thing for me

24
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:39,839
at this moment they wouldn't something
like pieces doesn't go week without some

25
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,599
major organization that we depend on
whether some piece of the government or

26
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:54,230
some some chain of stores some banks
being broken into and the basic problem

27
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,099
but security system

28
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:05,078
complicated we don't really know how we
don't know how to persuade ourselves

29
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:13,650
that anything was secure except for the
very simple and if you all for this

30
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:22,049
exceptional access you make them more
powerful and so that's exactly the wrong

31
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:29,160
thing at this moment when it seemed very
secure in these people want to make

32
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:37,250
everything less secure by adding
mechanisms that they did you just

33
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,680
incidentally I think that basic
sentiment explains a lot of insecurity

34
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,450
in the Internet to that because the
government on the only people who are

35
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,399
the most effective filled with doing
everybody

36
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:59,019
which I mean who will Apple Microsoft
etcetera one should be secure everyone

37
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:04,150
but then so if you have automatic
updates on your computer for example

38
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,440
that a certain ways makes you more
secure but it makes you utterly ballroom

39
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:17,829
the Apple and Microsoft or whoever is
provided and it is just basically you

40
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:23,590
big words the fact is what companies
want they want to dominate the customers

41
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:28,530
they want fundamentally that control of
their customers computers they don't

42
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:34,909
want what I would also which means I can
run any version of the software that I

43
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:44,120
like all open source code I can copy
anything I like I noticed incidentally

44
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,420
earlier said the Internet is gravure
important to note yeah anything you say

45
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:57,500
may be kept forever by somebody with it
isn't likely to be available to you and

46
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,360
a lot of people don't want that also
would like the same to Ruby and not let

47
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,540
to copy so they can have whatever
marketing strategy that like about

48
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:12,720
creating an emergency so

49
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,640
my view of security is least I don't
know how widespread it is but it isn't

50
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:23,570
affected me widespread nobody knows how
to make money and therefore get lots of

51
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,490
products out so forth

52
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:31,230
out doing the kind of centralizing
controlling things that all of the

53
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:36,650
successful operations are doing and you
can look at the cold war with the

54
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:53,260
government case is just well let me so
that I wasn't told my title until

55
00:05:53,260 --> 00:06:27,280
I was given some suggestions about what
I like to do with just about like I hope

56
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,888
you're bored

57
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:40,310
I have at least awful one reason I don't
believe it is generally over arts

58
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,599
believe the Young scored think they're
going to live forever quite simply no

59
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:48,050
better than the unpredictable up and you
know get old and die with everybody else

60
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:55,550
and I believe you know I'm old I'm going
to die I don't believe all of you know I

61
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,409
don't literally mean you think you're
going to live forever I doubt anybody

62
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:02,188
will live long enough to see the
collision with the Andromeda galaxy

63
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:06,169
vibrant I don't know what that would
mean but I think there are probably

64
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:08,628
people sitting here who me alive

65
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:17,110
hundred to 500,000 now we will track
meet people I don't know I used to be

66
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,439
designed human being for the end of the
first century and now I think we in the

67
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:26,469
first quarter and the first sort of
simple cases are already seen you know

68
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:28,370
didn't get the right mitochondrial

69
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:34,229
mother they can replace the mitochondria
when you are just a few of conceived and

70
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:38,710
give you a better mitochondrial so they
don't suffer

71
00:07:38,710 --> 00:08:00,560
so we're going to world writing
something very long and by which I mean

72
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:48,170
when you talk like that

73
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:54,760
twenty years ago about time because you
studying and you can talk intelligently

74
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:04,310
about that person take they lose track
you can gain

75
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:09,089
possible the old and gain all the
virtues of you but you can be young and

76
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:17,170
gained a lot of the virtues of a I
recommend that's all I had in my hand

77
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:23,430
somebody once asked questions ferris
wheel

78
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,469
asking questions

79
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,970
somebody else over
