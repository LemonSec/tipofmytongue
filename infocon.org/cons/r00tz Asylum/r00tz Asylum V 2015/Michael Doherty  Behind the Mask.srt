1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,950
good morning I'm a little out of a
democrat let me know what you guys up

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:12,509
really quickly in a general sense about
what happened to me and how that affects

3
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:19,660
you and dealing with bullying and how
many people here have probably been

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:25,609
bullied I but I've been bullied and
what's so whatever went to xtube always

5
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:40,260
try to use terms like physical so what
happened to me later my folks the bull

6
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,430
is getting more sophisticated than
natural your kid on the playground he

7
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:53,480
sometimes they can believe what they all
smiled and they'll be really nice talk

8
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,980
about the rights you might think you
don't have and then a blast through some

9
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:08,240
of this because this is a 45 minute talk
last week and so when I was when I was

10
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,030
being bullied by the government

11
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,479
I felt like I was on the Titanic I would
say I was the guy that was screaming

12
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,950
iceberg iceberg on April 12 shut up
because they were having a great time

13
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:24,729
dancing on the deck and I stepfather was
my job to run everybody and sometimes

14
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:29,670
when you're being bullied you seen as
the victim and and people are kind of

15
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,210
polite about victims in in a in a way of
these say they don't say they don't want

16
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:41,369
to believe you when you say something
bad about someone else people who want

17
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,020
to believe it when they see for
themselves so ironically victims of

18
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,350
bullying and have a difficult time
people don't see the billing themselves

19
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,429
so one of the ways I thought proper
outcome of the great things about what's

20
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,760
happening here

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,760
here it is so important for you guys to
have knowledge which are doing a young

22
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:07,250
age which is awesome said that you have
power to do and he you know deal with

23
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,039
the boys and in mind since the
government was the belly but not

24
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,950
everyone in the government's inability
to me i've met congressman a congressman

25
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,500
came to my book signing yesterday and
I've met people that press

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,220
everyone into a bully but please don't
have a lot of knowledge and technology

27
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:30,520
don't have a lot of knowledge right now
as we can see so we have a little more

28
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,550
babies needed mcgovern right now without
their knowledge so ok so I said in my

29
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:41,910
earlier toxic doing anyways many masks
more dangerous than mask of virtue a lot

30
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,549
of bullies later in life talk about how
they're here to help and they just want

31
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,250
to be nice and that's how they get you
to relax and not realize that the more

32
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:56,500
sophisticated and I come from medicine
for thirty years I was in medicine and I

33
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,840
see such a such a similarity in
technology now I think technologies with

34
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,739
medicine was about a hundred twenty-five
years ago or just on the guys and it's

35
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,040
exciting it's impacting everybody and
yet it's gonna be rock in the beginning

36
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,920
and and sometimes you've got people
coming in that don't have knowledge but

37
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,559
they have power in the government and
it's important that we be proactive and

38
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,760
learn early in life like your guys are
doing so that things can be set right

39
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,480
and we don't have to have all things
like this massive breach we had OPM or

40
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,090
that when we have big regions and in
companies that damaged everybody that we

41
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,310
work collaboratively not pulling each
other and finger pointing is that

42
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,560
doesn't help us in the future and
technology and when the temperature

43
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,750
about technology I think that is that
makes it more difficult than even

44
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,280
medicine

45
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,430
is that medicine we could see the
patient on the table can see the blood

46
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,569
we could see the disease in technology a
lot of its invisible so it's hard to

47
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:56,350
convince people with 22 trust the
knowledge you have so you have to work

48
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,260
really hard and educating its even
greater challenges we can see right now

49
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,810
I don't think you saw the government
trying to regulate medicine like crazy

50
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,000
a hundred years ago and you like they
are no they were doing a laser to get

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,010
out of its way and bureaucrats that have
scant experience that the world they

52
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:18,039
regulate so again the fact that you guys
are getting now it's so early in life

53
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,220
that you can use it for good I think
wait thanks so let's talk now and now

54
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,940
I've got watching a movie here so I got
two books I'm gonna give away so I'm

55
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,510
gonna sign him and so you pay ten some
of the stuff is we're going to test

56
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:38,659
question so we had won his first start
to me was like possibly happen that the

57
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,010
government's coming after me I mean
don't I get to go to court don't have my

58
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,099
rights don't like don't we get to hear
this out and I couldn't believe that my

59
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,270
lawyers were saying the government can
come at you and technology because

60
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:57,960
Congress has made a rule that something
may go on and if it doesn't go on you're

61
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,890
still guilty you can have nothing has
gone wrong happened but it could be set

62
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:07,110
up wrong and you're going to have your
your reputation ruined and and what I

63
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,280
realize was everything I will talk about
the government was half the true we have

64
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,479
three branches of government executive
branch which is the present the judicial

65
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,530
branch which are courts and then we have
the founding fathers really an agenda

66
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:29,590
that power in laws were really
especially difficult to put on the backs

67
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,299
of the people's right to be tough so not
didn't just make a legislative branch

68
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,340
date they took the legislative branch
they snapped into and we have a house

69
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,190
and the senate so congress believe it I
hear people complain about congress all

70
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,190
the time it's supposed to be a big man

71
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,100
yes it's supposed to be hard it's
supposed to be difficult to to get on

72
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,650
our backs the problem is it's also
difficult to fix this stupid things they

73
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,500
do it so they created a government
agency about a hundred years ago and

74
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:03,460
what they've done is they've taken the
power the separations up our way like I

75
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,640
i think we are supposed to be an open
hand and our freedoms to keep the power

76
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,840
of diluted as the space between the
fingers but when you take this

77
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:19,570
separations of the powers away you
create a fast friendly right so what

78
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:23,520
happens is you get the lead and then you
said calm before you get your due

79
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,010
process and that's why we have to
understand about these agencies what I

80
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:33,640
find people shocked about it they've got
this power they have their own courts

81
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,219
they have their own rules and Congress
says they can do that so the just the

82
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:48,250
judicial system can't intervene so that
creates corruption and what happened to

83
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,570
me specifically what the books about a
90 minute I that's up and ask questions

84
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:58,840
be sure to read overview the break is a
really read like a novel like a story

85
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,650
because when you communicate to others
it's better to speak in story because

86
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,520
that's how brains are wired for brains
are wired to tell a story of each others

87
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,070
lives and then we're not confrontation
with each other we don't get on the

88
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:17,790
opposite side and we consciously were
thinking when someone starts telling you

89
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,919
stuff you said council thing what does
it matter to me what naturally on the

90
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,609
other side but when you tell stories
like movies or books then you're on the

91
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,500
you can't get in each other's shoes you
can see each other's thoughts of you so

92
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,700
I read a book like a novel because i my
whole thing was I wanted everyone to

93
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,150
know hey this is unbelievable I can't
believe what they taught me in school

94
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:44,130
was wrong I don't get to have my day in
court and they get to win you drive by

95
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,889
having to spend billions on boilers and
they

96
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:49,699
the reputation get assassinated the
press the precious things about

97
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:53,310
government says it that way so probably
as and then we'll hear things like that

98
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,490
we don't stop our day and give someone a
trial we wait for the courts to finish

99
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,110
and then five years goes by your dead
it's just a tough you know and then what

100
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:06,219
gets fixed you know we really focus more
on understanding thats not helping

101
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:10,229
anyone just ease these guys keep their
job and we haven't focused on the right

102
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:22,789
things so i think is comes in many forms
one of the ways is overkill meaning

103
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:32,838
intimidating you to settle there is a
part that very day we've seen the

104
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,419
results are now charging technology here
in the way it is right now we have such

105
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:41,708
weeks in July so much information and
then bed people can get that power never

106
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:46,219
really understood how the current setup
we have these regulators really hurt us

107
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:53,350
I'm gonna stop right there because I
like 15 minutes 45 but that's how can

108
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,880
one do you guys understand that what you
doing fantastic that knowledge is power

109
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,209
and we understand how things are really
set up you can change and help change

110
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:08,969
you guys you guys are the leaders in the
future so here is a test question why

111
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:48,800
did the founding fathers separate the
legislative branch

112
00:09:48,800 --> 00:10:01,969
33 government
