1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:09,290
so I'm Dennis I don't think anyone knows
me here yet but I'll be talking about

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,059
access control systems have said little
demo there some of you guys have seen

3
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:22,019
something like this just a straight into
it so this is a thirty minute talking

4
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:25,459
it's made for 50 minutes walk you gonna
see me go little passed through this and

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,640
I'm gonna be skipping a lot of kind of
the more technical information just to

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,110
save time but I don't want to just
enough all talk I'll be giving it

7
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:41,739
tomorrow at 12 at DEFCON 101 trek so I'm
didn't want that so long as well thats

8
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:44,419
like but that's me I'm on twitter

9
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,699
1 I'm security researcher at Kelsey
consulting do a lot of stuff like

10
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:51,989
hacking access control systems or
whatever they tell me how so

11
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,530
so what is a physical access control
system so physical access control a lot

12
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,809
of you guys have seen this if you lived
in an apartment complex gated community

13
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:06,420
visited some commercial or shared office
spaces you see in the box kind of like

14
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,220
this where you know maybe you walk up to
it

15
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,970
type in a number and call someone they
press nine on the phone and lets them in

16
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:22,250
so that's an access control system they
do things like they controlled or they

17
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,730
can open and closed doors gates
elevators barrier arms you know stuff

18
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,560
that you see around downtown or an
apartment or you know some of higher-end

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,770
homes so how do they work well to open
these doors that they control they have

20
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:43,140
a physical you know there's a bunch of
weight again you can type on that keypad

21
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,130
over there there's little transmitters
you can do this you know if you have the

22
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,770
right key will let you in when you press
the button

23
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:55,399
there's RFID there's no there's plenty
of ways you can do to allow get this

24
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,970
device to allow UN and quick recap talk
about this democrat quick I have here an

25
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,650
axis controller it's just like when you
see an apartment it's hoped that the

26
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,090
same way the only difference is that I
don't have an actual door I have four

27
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,670
numbers and each number represents a
door so when you see one light up like

28
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,470
that two or three has now

29
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,400
or dare to believe it's lit up there you
go

30
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,220
is now open so you'll see you know those
doors you actually never see door one

31
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,510
open because during my experimentation I
didn't really read the manual and I blew

32
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,500
up the relay that controlled or 12
literally exploded so you'll never see

33
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,090
one light up that's right you not gonna
need to so let's moving on

34
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,180
where do you see these things you see
these again like I said gated

35
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,780
communities parking garages apartments
hotels you know pretty much anywhere

36
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,530
where they want to control access to
certain places so you have many

37
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,810
different vendors like the one I have
here you have Doorking is a one vendor

38
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,510
you've probably seen some of these
Chamberlayne syntex is all these are all

39
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,390
starting to look familiar if you guys
ever used one or walked up to one and

40
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,329
then you have linear just like this one
over here is linear brand they have many

41
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,340
different models so here's some use
cases here's my take on the field of

42
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,580
these are outside downtown Austin you
can just walk up to the building and

43
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,170
start using them they take keypad
something RFID cards whatever you want

44
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,530
right here is some of the one in front
of an apartment complex and another one

45
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,290
in front of an office building where
cars drive up and either type in a

46
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,799
special code or swipe their badge
against the reader

47
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,880
more examples of other you know units
you've got elevators a control of

48
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,600
interest to you and here you see what in
a networking closet there's three of

49
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,480
them these three boxes their setup they
have no keypad or anything to them

50
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,310
they're just set up to 22 interface with
card readers on doors and other

51
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,990
locations so they all come to one
network closet inside those gray boxes

52
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,710
are little device like this it's pretty
much the same thing as I have here on

53
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,970
this table but without the display
without a keypad is just use per maybe

54
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,050
RFID scanning or maybe expanding off of
this to add more you know

55
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:12,570
ability to control more doors so this is
pretty funny because you can you'll

56
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,380
never guess where I found this one right
there in a toilet so honest and of

57
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,680
course I'm building in the bathroom

58
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,830
there's a little gray box so curious
curious what's in it I open it and sure

59
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,620
enough it's a little access control that
controls access to the building so I

60
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,520
thought that was pretty funny so linear
access control so now that we talked

61
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,380
about what access control really is I'll
talk about a specific vendor reason why

62
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,700
I am focusing on this number is not to
say how bad they are but just the

63
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,240
interest of time I only had a lot of
time enough time to focus researching on

64
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,750
its been a plus too expensive this box
cost $1700 the buying your own so not

65
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,740
gonna buy more than one of those so
linear has many different models they're

66
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,550
all the same I won't go into detail
because they're all pretty much the same

67
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,330
this one here is the one used on the
left 81,000 there's a 2000 which is the

68
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,070
same thing just a bigger screen and 8
a.m. three-plus which again is the same

69
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,790
thing just with no screen so these these
are pretty cool they have a lot of

70
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,990
functionality they utilize a telephone
line so you can call someone to let you

71
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,120
win

72
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,970
they also support thousands of users of
the great for large installations like

73
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,040
big apartments or shared offices their
network today can be networked with

74
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,949
other controllers so that you can you
know have more than one of these in

75
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:36,979
different locations and have ability to
control more doors and such and the best

76
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:39,880
part is and will be talking about a lot
is a can be configured and even

77
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,820
controlled through a PC serial
connection let's talk a little bit about

78
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,419
how it connects so we're not gonna talk
too much about this but this is the

79
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:52,669
device that uses to turn a serial
connection and to a conventional tcp/ip

80
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:57,609
connection and this is what would this
is what is normally used in most big

81
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:05,260
installations to allow management to
remotely monitor control the the access

82
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,370
control system from wherever they are so
typical installation is a habit like

83
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,740
this you've seen these on the walls
whatever here's what's happening behind

84
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,530
the scenes you have the eighty-one
thousand plus controller and thats hope

85
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:22,109
that through a serial cable to the
series of TTP device that would allow

86
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:27,080
this controller to connect to the
network devices connected via ethernet

87
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,330
cable network router or switch or
whatever network you want and then you

88
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,070
have another management PC anywhere in
the network or even on the internet

89
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,190
because this can be able enabled for the
internet you have that manager at PC

90
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,520
communicating with the controller and
pushing you know new users to it or

91
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,950
opening doors from the computer but so
on so forth so how does that manager PC

92
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:53,219
communicated with the controller well
uses software call access based 2000

93
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,460
it's a software developed by the guys at
linear where you can add or remove users

94
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,489
you can you add entry codes you can add
specific transmitters to allow them

95
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,099
access to the device you can manually
toggle relays and target the relay is

96
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,500
what controls the door so when you
toggle relay you open or closed that

97
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,210
door depending on you know what currency
the doors are you can view log reports

98
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:20,630
these things do logging as pretty well

99
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:28,550
communicates through serial you know the
computer talks to the serious a TCP a

100
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:35,880
device like I have here and then it
interfaces with a controller and it does

101
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:42,040
require password to authenticate you do
need a password in this application and

102
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,580
that circle bucks over there you type in
a pasture in this is interesting because

103
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,050
the password is required to work with
the controller but the pastors only six

104
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,630
digits exactly six digit numbers only
that means there's only a possibility of

105
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:00,890
only a million passwords exactly right
so we'll talk about that in a second so

106
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,120
how does communicate exactly well when
someone's using the software on the

107
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,280
computer

108
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,989
they they use a softer and softer sends
a specific request a string of data to

109
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,140
the controller and the controller will
respond back either acknowledged meaning

110
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,700
the data the command is good and it did
a job or not acknowledge me the command

111
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,789
is bad and it didn't do anything

112
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:26,110
invalid checksum if the if the message
is broken somehow that's a bad

113
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,370
connection bill comes back invalid
checksum the messages envelop or no

114
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,349
response if you don't have that password

115
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:38,070
it's not gonna respond at all so that's
that let's let's just dive right into

116
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,620
the attacks don't spend too much time on
techno stuff so let's go to tech so how

117
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,670
do we take these controllers with as
many ways you can target these right

118
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,969
you've you've all walked up to one
driven up to 10 whatever physical access

119
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,090
is probably the easiest thing to get
cities controllers because they're meant

120
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,730
to be walked up to and to press you know
mess with so one thing you can do is

121
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:03,500
possibly look program them locally there
is functionally we can program them

122
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,300
locally you don't have to use a computer
and that's where much smaller

123
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,420
installations

124
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,810
there's also a serial port inside of
these controllers if you do want to

125
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,150
program it from a computer so let's talk
about local taxes talk about how we can

126
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:21,750
do stuff like local programming or
hijack the serial port so 24 password so

127
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,860
you have the 8500 8500 is pretty much
smaller version of what I have on a

128
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,690
table its it only supports two doors and
said a whore and it cannot be controlled

129
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,030
from

130
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:36,720
computer because it's made for much
simpler installation 6811 door one game

131
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,640
in front of some very rich house or
something like that

132
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:45,310
so these things can be programmed route
from the keypad themselves and so how do

133
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,910
you do that you hold 20 into and when
you do that you get a password prompt

134
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:53,350
asking you for the password you type the
default password 123456 what I've

135
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,670
noticed is that in the documentation the
state's 123456 is a default password and

136
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,199
who changes that right when you're
installing this who thinks the change it

137
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,520
obviously the install is that you're
paying you know the lowest bid contract

138
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,550
for is not going to worry about security
so they haven't changed it and to be

139
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,170
honest most of these that i've seen in
the fields are always the default

140
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,020
password so trying to put password if it
doesn't work you can try common passes

141
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:23,370
like 11 want to do so let's say deposit
or so 123456 pound now we're in

142
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,100
programming mode now we can do whatever
we want so we do is we input a command

143
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:34,020
to add a new entry code and that's gonna
be 30 1999 pounding and I'm fine and I'm

144
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:39,579
power so that the next light what that
means and once once you're in all you

145
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,990
have to once you done with that all you
have to do is type 9999 which is your

146
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:49,380
new entry code that no one knows about
and access granted so what do we just do

147
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,960
let's recap that so first thing we did
is we did 123456 we entered programming

148
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,300
mode by holding 02 and doing the podcast
and pressing pound as enter pound is

149
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:05,520
your answer screen next week we entered
entry code programming mode by typing in

150
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,010
thirty one pound that that allows us to
enter a new entry code then we enter

151
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,270
enter code in this case I chose 9999 you
can do

152
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:18,780
1337 1111 whatever you want the next
thing you have to do is just confirm it

153
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,850
just type it again just so it knows that
you make a mistake and then 99 pound

154
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,490
exit programming mode now you're out all
you have to do is type your new entry

155
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:32,529
code and you're in show you how quick
and easy to do that so i didnt hear

156
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:49,350
and let's do that so there was this was
like completely flashed to default

157
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,870
settings I don't have an intricate
before in less than 10 seconds I was

158
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,620
able to quickly put in the password
program and recover and get in and it's

159
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,449
that easy so what's the use of these
devices it's not really protecting you

160
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:07,540
just you just gotta be careful with
making sure you change the password and

161
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,670
you you know you don't want to be
vulnerable to something like that so

162
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:16,240
another problem what is the password is
not depart and it something else well

163
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,850
when I found out his master key these
devices there's little key slot on this

164
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,589
device here to lock it so people can't
get inside and mess with the internal

165
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:30,480
components well I found out that after
acquiring this device it came with a key

166
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,930
like holding here in my hand and the one
here in picture which is by the way the

167
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,910
same key and they're all the same this
box 81 thousand-plus that I have right

168
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:44,279
here on this table if you see anyone in
front of your apartment or whatever it's

169
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,389
gonna be the same key you most likely
they come ship the fault with the same

170
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:54,689
key so I had to keep my hand I can get
in your apartment if it's using that not

171
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:59,180
only the eighty-one thousand plus other
models am3+ that I found in the bathroom

172
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,430
same key

173
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:06,099
you can you can purchase this key of
course you wanna spent $1700 you can buy

174
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,710
that and it comes to the key or you can
actually you know if you like to try to

175
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,990
find the key on ebay or find maybe
someone selling to the enclosure a

176
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,160
plastic little enclosure itself that
lots incomes of the key that's only be a

177
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,589
hundred bucks because it doesn't come
with any components so try to find the

178
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:25,300
key or if you want you can pick the lock
I'm sure people have talked about

179
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,699
locking here already

180
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,390
you can this is a fairly easy locked pic
so nothing special and when you open it

181
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:38,770
gives you full access to device so let's
go into real quick before that like I

182
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,300
said that is the key so this PowerPoint
is me upload it you can always just you

183
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,290
know go over there and make a copy of
the key from what you see in that

184
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:52,140
picture so but I wouldn't recommend
doing that so what does opening this box

185
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,880
with the key give you it gives you
physical access components so what can

186
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:02,240
you do well in the stairs manually
manual relay last month so let's say

187
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,980
something happens and the door stuck
closed or stuck open and pressing this

188
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,339
button doesn't work let's say that would
work well so we can go in there and

189
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:38,830
press the button to just open the doors
all too real quick

190
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:45,150
alright so you can also lock their state
when you press that button now that

191
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,180
bundys Press forever until you press the
button again or turn off and turn on the

192
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,800
controller so just you know if you want
to keep the door open or gate opened the

193
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,000
community the complex you can have your
party come in the apartment without

194
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,800
having to let people in the right way
remember I said really want exploded

195
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,459
that you kind of see it there is little

196
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,570
hardness over there yet that that
happens

197
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,610
programming but there's also programming
buns in this device located where that

198
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,820
ever was and you can use that to program
it and certain circumstances or if you

199
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:25,470
just wanna be mean you can you can just
erase the firmware and you know make it

200
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,960
forget all the devices

201
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,920
there's also an active phone line if you
want a message that and a serial

202
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,219
connection to the controller and we'll
talk about some attacks can do with that

203
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,140
next another thing is there's a
temperament

204
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,460
monitor the little bag down the side
that's going to allow you to us that's

205
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,780
gonna that's used so that people can
know when a device is actually been

206
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:51,189
opened with a key or not so the thing is
no active alerts it's really hard to

207
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,910
actually know that someone's opening you
have to go pull the logs manually

208
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:59,140
another problem is it can also be
bypassed by big magnet so let me show

209
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:04,410
you how to do that so again there's a
temporary blips on button click there go

210
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:08,810
the temperature inside the little white
thing and so you see as I open the

211
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,469
controller it lets me know that the
control has been opened and closed all

212
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,370
update life so I'm gonna do with them
and carefully put this eighty-pound bank

213
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,960
has eighty-pound of pulling force this
magnum the slide gloves to protect

214
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:26,070
myself and that went over the controller
even seen nothing happens the logs have

215
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:32,680
no idea that the control has been open
so I open it and no no update those of

216
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,719
the old entries close again nothing
happens the controller has no idea it's

217
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,920
been open because the magnet is
literally disabling that tamper

218
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,630
detection switch so the same old same
old so moving on so we've talked about

219
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,520
this now sorry about the fun stuff

220
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,520
let's talk about how to remote access
talking to these devices on the network

221
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,250
wetherbee internal year maybe you plug
into a cable and the leasing office and

222
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,050
apartment

223
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:03,270
external these things are connected to
the Internet which as they often are

224
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:09,829
again these devices communicate through
through a network connection instead of

225
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:14,800
having to specify serial port you can
specify an IP address and port which

226
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,980
makes things a lot easier to make slows
you use it on Linux or Mac whatever you

227
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:24,660
can communicate with this effectively
the same thing the computer does to

228
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,030
communicate the killer a bad guy can do
the same thing to if they find the IP

229
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,560
address of this device let's talk about
some remote attacks so first I'm gonna

230
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:40,120
quickly do a demo so here is the
application texts not very good there so

231
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,100
hopefully you guys will be understand
anyway but to connect to it you have

232
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,810
this application and just click this
button here to connect the device but

233
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:51,919
you see the problem is that back to use
it says wrong password

234
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,070
not going to connect because the
password is incorrect member we need

235
00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:00,689
that password so how do we how do we
solve that issue as an attacker can I

236
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,580
can I get there you go

237
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,679
force attack remember the password is
exactly six digits numbers only we can

238
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:12,690
brute force is easily there's no rate
limiting so I can keep getting there is

239
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,500
no rate limiting so I can send it as
fast as the connection will allow

240
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,920
there's no pastor lockout
second-guessing and again it's small I

241
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,870
can only one million possible passwords
and you can skip this you can just keep

242
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:28,510
sending this data and it'll respond back
whether the bastards good or not so let

243
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:34,270
me quickly demonstrate that out of time
here so we'll go quick hit the wrong

244
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:40,160
password so I whipped up a transcript of
this a cat brute force so what it's

245
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,310
doing now is it's getting the password
it's it's trying combinations and then

246
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,230
it's gonna start from 2000 2009

247
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,380
whatever you see it's trying more than
once because what is doing is it keeps

248
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,880
trying a password till it gets a valid
response whether it's incorrect or

249
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,620
whether it's correct and I want to get
an actual valid responses that the past

250
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,678
is incorrect it moves on it increments
and keeps getting the bastard yes it may

251
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:07,390
take about four days if it goes to the
entire case basis but it's still doable

252
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:13,720
so as it's as it's before saying it'll
report they go success the massacre in

253
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:20,429
this case is 0000 51 let's try that we
go to set up network to hear type in the

254
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:28,900
password 12345 one and they're now
connected with the with the tax basis

255
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:35,419
hours after I can go here and for
example trigger the relays of not the

256
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:39,570
doors are now been opened and I have
access to the complex I can also I want

257
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:48,649
to you added you know delete users right
so that's brute force attack so what

258
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:53,799
else can we do well these things in a
password right turns oh maybe not really

259
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:59,220
they need a password to use that
application but it turns out if you send

260
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,770
a specific request on your own without
the software he said that request to the

261
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:08,030
controller it won't respond back it
won't tell me that the request is good

262
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,660
because I don't have the password but
it'll still execute that request you

263
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,330
know it it will still take an
unauthenticated command and perform the

264
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,678
job that it was told to do and I mean a
symbol that authentication is not really

265
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,380
needed so I'll send send send data into
you know forget the password to school

266
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,299
right around the right so what can I do
with that

267
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:30,059
open doors remotely of course send one
simple commanding in this case that's a

268
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:37,690
command to open a specific door and the
controller just execute it just does ok

269
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,610
door open

270
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:44,360
sure it won't tell me that the doors
open at the doors open who cares for

271
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,189
movie cell scenes you resent that movie
where you know you got a hacker in the

272
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,130
in the van

273
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:54,060
and there's a bunch of jewellery these
trying to get in and the hackers is

274
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,129
going presses

275
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,900
something on his keyboard and then the
jewish these are in the museum without

276
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,410
having to to to break any windows and
also on the declaration of independence

277
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:09,620
of stolen so that I don't you can do is
you can lock doors you can lock these

278
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,600
states that the states of the door so
you can keep them closed and keep them

279
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,139
open and the only way to fix it is to
unlock them or reboot the controller so

280
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,250
some scenarios and when you walk in they
won't respond to anything right now

281
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:27,810
there are two opening but once a lot the
relays nothing would happen and so you

282
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:32,790
can keep all the doors or gates lots of
people can get in or out or you can keep

283
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:36,260
them open so anyone can get and you can
have that super awesome party that your

284
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,720
parents would allow you to have so again

285
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,970
persist until manually unlock door and
another thing you can do is if you do

286
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,830
want the password so you can use a tax
base 2000 software you don't need to

287
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,080
know the passer une tu brute force it
you can just change it turns out you can

288
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,669
push a firmware update to these devices
that has still contains the password or

289
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:03,390
any password you want and it will take
it it'll change password and it'll

290
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:08,380
remain functional working with the
normal you know people that are allowed

291
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:14,880
to be using it so why even brute force
it you can just change it so moving on

292
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,110
then our service last last tackle talk
about is if you want to be really mean

293
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:26,709
and just you know deny access to that
you can take a database update and now

294
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,690
also that's no longer able to be used
you know once if it's if it's trying to

295
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,650
do a database update I sent a message to
do a database of it but never never tell

296
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,630
to stop and once it's doing that it
won't take them and it's a database that

297
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,710
is done and to fix that you have to
reboot the controller and other goodies

298
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,059
you can override device firmware and
that will completely just erase

299
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:50,928
make it completely unusable someone
fixes it like we talked about you can

300
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:55,129
lock the relays lock the doors so I'll
quickly just go over a quick and easy

301
00:22:55,129 --> 00:22:59,889
tool that I just created just to do for
all those attacks that we've talked

302
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:13,389
about so I have a tool here it's ok so
happy to hear it's really easy it's it's

303
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:17,830
kind of pointing clickers point for
command-line this doesn't authenticate

304
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:22,259
with any password it's just I pointed to
the IP address the controller and I can

305
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:25,309
do now I can do anything here so trigger
release

306
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:30,740
let's do that so all I have to do is
type 1234 and you see all the relays

307
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,169
except one cuz it exploded all they
really have open and as simple as that I

308
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:38,659
found this device on the network were
found on the internet I use this tool

309
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:45,580
and everything's open you can lock the
doors so let's say a lot a lot to open

310
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:51,289
to now stays open until I reboot the
device or manual like it and if I try to

311
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:56,669
do anything nothing happens it stays
open let's lock it closed now let's look

312
00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:02,779
to close out Tuesday's close and again
nothing will work nothing will open and

313
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:07,809
then if I do want to fix it because I'm
not that mean like it was a lot and you

314
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:13,720
can be opened again one another thing
you do is if you upload the Department

315
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,039
figuration I'm not gonna take some time
to replace the protesters and of course

316
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,619
another service so you have one you have
had this thing working properly

317
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:29,090
2013 right if you deny service it's been
set now you can't see it but if you

318
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:33,110
walked up to the screen in a database
update in progress in OC that forever

319
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:39,629
until I told to stop and nothing happens
no lights no doors open and so it

320
00:24:39,629 --> 00:24:42,559
completely makes it unusable and let's
stop it so let's stop it

321
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:49,029
10 everything works again so that's the
quick talk I'll be working a lot more

322
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,300
and that's all

323
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:55,919
it's a prototype for now and so I'll
close it off cause I'm starting to get

324
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:03,080
over time I didn't do this talk to to to
just say that this vendor is bad because

325
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,060
they're not I just wanted to you know
kind of bring attention to these issues

326
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,889
because of one vendor has issues other
vendors are gonna have similar issues as

327
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:16,640
well so just keep in mind that just
because you don't use linear doesn't

328
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,440
mean you're not you not you know you
don't have security issues in europe

329
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,420
complex on this is ongoing research I'm
not done at all I'm doing more research

330
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:29,020
on this device on other vendors as well
as ongoing that's what I have released a

331
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,570
tool it's currently still just a
prototype but I'll continue to make

332
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:37,290
updates anyone can also contribute its
own get hope you can reach it there and

333
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,290
despite the site will be updated as well

334
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,909
the full version of these lights are
shut down for more than 30 minutes off

335
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,670
the full version will is online I'll
actually be giving the spool talk

336
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,550
tomorrow at DEFCON 11 at 12 or 15
minutes if you guys want to come out for

337
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:56,220
more information about it I'll be there
and that's it so I'm not a time so if

338
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,340
you want questions I'm gonna pack all
this up now you can treat me you can

339

around for a bit then walked down and do

340
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,820
more practice for the stock and that are
