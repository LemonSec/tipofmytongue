1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,740
all right

2
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,820
good afternoon everybody thanks for

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,719
coming

4
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,720
everybody awake after lunch

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,180
somewhat I took it easy so I'd stay

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,560
awake too

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,019
my name is Brandon Knute I amateur radio

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,900
call sign Kea KNX that is not something

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,060
clever it's uh

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,880
sequentially assigned by the FCC

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,700
uh the next one is k-a-k-n-y if you

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,260
think real hard you can probably figure

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,480
out the one before me

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,340
uh I'll be discussing amateur radio

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,620
today this will be the extent of my

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,700
Limited

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,460
knowledge but it's a fun hobby and I'd

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,079
like to get into

19
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,360
what how why

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,260
that kind of thing

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,960
quick definition radio frequency in

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,579
relation to amateur radio is the

23
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,620
oscillation rate but alternating

24
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,799
electric current which energy from an

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,260
oscillating can radiate off a conductor

26
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,860
into space as radio waves how most of us

27
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,960
work in kind of a tech field where we

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,360
work with uh

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,820
electrical frequencies going down wires

30
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,000
this is just that leaving the wire

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,040
now we're going to use you'll hear hear

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,640
terms like meters waves

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,880
uh bands those kinds of things you know

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,720
we're using the the two meter band well

35
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,659
what that means is uh if you look at the

36
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,220
receiving

37
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,100
animation there

38
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,619
um the distance between the Peaks and

39
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,180
those those left and right so it's

40
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,400
positives and negatives the greater the

41
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,500
distance the uh

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,060
the lower the frequency the amount of

43
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,799
times that that changes from positive to

44
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,780
negative

45
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,000
these are kinds of examples of how

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,880
these this is a basic wire intent how

47
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,500
are received so if

48
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,560
you'll hear terms like polarization so

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,759
if the

50
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,399
the antennas turn 90 degrees away from

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,840
the radiating Source it's not going to

52
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,979
pick up as well

53
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,020
and on the transmitting one this is kind

54
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,819
of kind of shaped like uh I tried to

55
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,800
find a 3dm an animation but it didn't

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,660
really work out too well that's kind of

57
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,420
how it broadcasts out so if you picture

58
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,220
this wire antenna kind of 90 degrees off

59
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,480
from that transmitting one it's not

60
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,400
going to pick up

61
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,840
as well

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,560
if at all

63
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,420
now this is the kinds of electromagnetic

64
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,480
radiation we look at all day uh basis of

65
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,400
this one's kind of on the far left

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,500
and uh radio frequencies I'm sure

67
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,360
everybody's familiar with uh

68
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,220
a microwave

69
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,360
and uh similar to your your cell phones

70
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,800
those are just radio frequencies used to

71
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,379
either transmit data or resonate with

72
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,239
water molecules to heat up your food and

73
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,620
it goes on as the as these things

74
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,300
get in higher frequency you get into

75
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,519
visible light that we can see uh

76
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,019
infrared light if anybody's following

77
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,060
around the James Webb Telescope all the

78
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,459
neat images that's putting out infrared

79
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,700
light we our eyes can't physically see

80
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,920
it but it's just a different wavelength

81
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,319
that x-ray is to find all your boo-boos

82
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,180
and gamma rays that turn people into uh

83
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,860
Incredible Hulk and and such

84
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,239
boring terms then we'll get into more

85
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,480
fun stuff I promise the uh

86
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,580
quick shot of the radio frequency chart

87
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,220
almost every bit of the

88
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,040
available radio frequency in every

89
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,099
thing is is taken up you'll see uh

90
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,400
military your fm broadcast from rock 105

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,659
and all those that's the blue one on the

92
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,799
top right uh television channels and

93
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,720
cellular bands all these things are are

94
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,659
taken up by something and they all

95
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,220
require different licensing different

96
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,379
permissions and all that stuff you'll

97
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,440
see the in the middle row amateur two

98
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,080
meter band

99
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,319
and that's right in between two military

100
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,000
frequencies this is why there's

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,379
uh Power limits and limits on why or how

102
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,420
somebody can transmit because if you

103
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,798
start interrupting military

104
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,660
Transmissions then

105
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,459
people in uniforms knock on your door

106
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,940
and pretty easy to find

107
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,320
this is the radio allocation for amateur

108
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,740
radio operators you'll see two meters 30

109
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,259
meters this is that's the the distance

110
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,360
between the Peaks on those radio

111
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,419
Transmissions so they're 17 meters apart

112
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,220
now that correlates to the size of your

113
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,720
antenna some of these antennas can get

114
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,919
pretty huge

115
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,500
uh two meters

116
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,740
you see that that's what about six feet

117
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,120
thereabouts

118
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,460
roughly translated

119
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,820
so the the peak and the valleys are

120
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,860
two meters about six feet apart when

121
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,320
those invisible wavelengths this is a

122
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,660
quarter wavelength

123
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,540
antenna so it's a quarter of that

124
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,780
wavelength it's just kind of a visual

125
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,460
reference

126
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,800
yes it's a bow thing radio don't don't

127
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,000
judge me

128
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,560
forces

129
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,180
uh

130
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,620
colors and a lot of different

131
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,780
information on here is is generally what

132
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,880
is acceptable to use on these

133
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,080
frequencies you can do about anything

134
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,560
but if you try to use you know talk on

135
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,380
something that's generally set aside for

136
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,240
morse code than

137
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,880
uh somebody will complain but

138
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,860
it's really not that useful until you

139
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,639
actually get into it

140
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,560
now what is ham radio and same thing as

141
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,380
amateur radio pejorative term used in

142
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,580
professional

143
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,280
uh telegraphy in the 19th century to

144
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,259
mock new amateurs

145
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,080
uh who were not as good with Morse code

146
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,960
or ham fisted because this is a

147
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,780
relatively new uh I guess over 100 years

148
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,740
now

149
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,900
but they were it kind of spawned off of

150
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,720
professional Telegraph operators

151
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,580
uh it's use of radio frequency of

152
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,199
purposes of non-commercial exchanger

153
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,020
messages

154
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,280
experimentation cell training proper

155
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,020
Recreation

156
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,940
and emergency communication con

157
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,699
contesting lots of activities

158
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,919
when we say non-commercial uh your

159
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,380
terrestrial radio and television anybody

160
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,800
still has rabbit ear antennas for the TV

161
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,440
uh radio in your car that's all in radio

162
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,020
frequency but it's just licensed

163
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,880
differently

164
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,280
uh your satellite services you know

165
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,139
Internet TV there are amateur radio

166
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,520
satellites but again they're on

167
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,160
dedicated

168
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,300
frequencies with transmission modes

169
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,360
business two-way communication also uh

170
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,639
mostly

171
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,280
VHF Communications cabs tow trucks or

172
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,319
cabs even using radios anymore

173
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,180
maybe not tow trucks are anyway those

174
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,440
are separate

175
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,600
frequencies separate bands set aside for

176
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,100
other uses and your cell phones

177
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,780
excuse me cell phones are just ultra

178
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,060
high frequency transceivers when you get

179
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,740
down to it that's all they that's all

180
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,539
they really are they transmit data

181
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,539
compressed voice and all that

182
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,060
uh Wireless experimentation this is an

183
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,460
image of a program called whisper uh

184
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,699
weak signal propagation reporter

185
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,940
uh it's an Internet connected automated

186
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,979
system that people connect to the radios

187
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,199
and see how far away their signals can

188
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,900
be picked up and how far away uh they

189
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,720
can receive signals this is a station in

190
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,400
somewhere in Europe buried in signals

191
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,080
but it's picking up from the United

192
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,139
States from appears to be maybe Russia

193
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,419
China South America it's

194
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:48,660
really low signal power digital mode

195
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,780
where it's not it's just transmitting a

196
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,259
little bits of data just to see where

197
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,419
your signal possibly could be could be

198
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,840
picked up

199
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:02,280
all right

200
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,060
it's an image of a antenna modeling

201
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,759
software that can be used to test out

202
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,740
because new antennas are being made all

203
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,539
the time it's more than just a

204
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,759
a wire or a metal rod stuck up in the

205
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,599
air

206
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,419
all kinds of different methods this is

207
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,039
cheaper and easier to kind of get a base

208
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,979
to before you get out into out into the

209
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,660
field

210
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,280
and test out your new antenna

211
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,599
uh

212
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,479
this is a program called FL Digi it's a

213
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,039
digital mode it's kind of keyboard to

214
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,360
keyboard

215
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,219
over the radio

216
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,219
now it's all kind of proprietary not

217
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,320
proprietary the open source

218
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,720
and coding because encryption over

219
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,140
amateur radio is I guess the lull

220
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,420
but encoding

221
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,959
something like this this is a

222
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,120
I'm not sure which app like this

223
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,220
which one it's actually using there's

224
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,779
all kinds of different methods to

225
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,580
transmit Digital radio

226
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,420
uh it's it's a lot more stable than

227
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,980
trying to transmit voice because they're

228
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,360
just

229
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,339
kind of a narrow focus on what's

230
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,500
actually being transmitted

231
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,320
and then five points for whoever can

232
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:20,700
we'll put it go

233
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,420
I broke it

234
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:26,119
broke it again

235
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,240
no

236
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,180
no sound that's all right

237
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,300
Adam Morris code uh snip it in there

238
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,040
just want to give a prize to whoever

239
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,080
could guess it

240
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,300
no big deal but you're familiar with

241
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,339
Morse code at all SOS

242
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,440
I was supposed to stay secure did you

243
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,080
somebody didn't hear it okay it was

244
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,360
Secure WV in Morse code it's still

245
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,519
pretty popular uh people like to make

246
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,959
little devices called Bugs which

247
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,279
actually aren't much

248
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,200
larger than this but they're complete

249
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,899
transceivers they'll throw a wire on a

250
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:07,019
tree and see how far they can reach

251
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,640
with just a little device like that

252
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,860
that's beyond my

253
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,100
patience to learn I'm sure I could but

254
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,660
I guess I'm too geeky for that I'd

255
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,279
rather use the

256
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,940
a Raspberry Pi to do the same thing

257
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,640
uh it's mostly self-training kind of a

258
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,100
way to get into it there's cram sessions

259
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,600
where they go through all the questions

260
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,040
and

261
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,980
roll right into the test

262
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,060
I I went through ham radio for dummies

263
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,860
that was my entry into it and it's an

264
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,779
aptly named title because

265
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,519
anybody that knows who knows it applies

266
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,660
Club Gatherings radio clubs do have

267
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,579
I don't know of anybody any of the meat

268
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,620
in person anymore I know the local ones

269
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,180
they're all virtual now

270
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,459
but they're uh they always have a topic

271
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,040
to go over uh something to build

272
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,720
something to talk about

273
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,820
uh Nets they're just club meetings kind

274
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,700
of on the air they can meet from

275
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,560
anywhere anywhere your radio can can

276
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,300
receive most of them are

277
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,700
are regular and uh Jamboree on the air

278
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,620
it was

279
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,579
to last week that's uh my scouting uh

280
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:17,220
Scouts BSA event where Scouts from all

281
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,980
over the world try to contact each other

282
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,480
on that day

283
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,060
cutting it to participate this year but

284
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,740
it's uh it's pretty neat especially to

285
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,779
have the world Jamboree going on a few

286
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,519
years ago radio operators were checking

287
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,800
in from all over the place trying to

288
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,899
reach uh reach the scouts that came here

289
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,680
to visit West Virginia

290
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,300
can be typically a private event you

291
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,800
know solo

292
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,959
activities just sitting in your ham

293
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:49,339
Shack and trying to make contacts

294
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:50,760
experimenting with different

295
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,800
Technologies and like I said people are

296
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,839
are inventing new technologies all the

297
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,420
time more more efficient ways to

298
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,760
transmit more efficient ways to to

299
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,860
receive that's both in hardware and

300
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,660
radios and antennas

301
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,180
and software that actually decodes and

302
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,279
encodes all of the all the digital

303
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,680
Transmissions

304
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,660
and trying to make uh

305
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,579
a big thing is it's contesting if you

306
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,740
see oh there it again

307
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,880
on the right side there's a uh called a

308
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,360
qsl it's a postcard made from

309
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,519
uh contact from

310
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,800
from anywhere around the world

311
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,200
I've only got two I think but I'm not as

312
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,580
active as I'd like to be

313
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,279
[Music]

314
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,500
radio sport more active ways to get into

315
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,720
amateur radio radio Direction finding

316
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,640
called uh fox hunting oftentimes

317
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,639
somebody will hide a transmitter in the

318
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,200
woods in an urban environment somewhere

319
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,500
and use your radio radio equipment to go

320
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,639
find it

321
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,160
uh Summit on the air it's hiking

322
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,920
mountain peaks and making contacts from

323
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,139
from there activating those both

324
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,899
receiving and uh and sending to get some

325
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:02,700
of our

326
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,820
less healthy radio operators out and

327
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,880
active and this picture is called a sort

328
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,240
of a d Expedition or a distance exchange

329
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,120
Expedition they'll go to remote Islands

330
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,300
remote places to make contacts activate

331
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,240
these islands and people will block them

332
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,339
on their Maps log the contacts

333
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,260
and it just becomes a big thing to

334
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,519
travel to

335
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,880
a Midway Island to uh getting a contact

336
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,180
from the Vatican is is a super rare one

337
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,040
uh you know just going through the

338
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,440
procedure to

339
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,420
get licensed in these countries and then

340
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,000
activate them get the the postcards from

341
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,320
all these places log them into your

342
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,459
logbook

343
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,120
what a point of Pride there

344
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,899
contesting is one of the more popular

345
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,519
things all frequency of transmission

346
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,940
modes low power levels

347
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,920
locations you know filling in

348
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,139
every county in the state every state

349
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,360
and the

350
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,519
country every country in the continent

351
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,380
trying to make contacts from all over

352
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,740
the place

353
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,079
a big thing for amateur radio

354
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,959
emergency communication there's lots of

355
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,459
different

356
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,740
organizations for this the amateur radio

357
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,420
emergency service

358
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,180
that's uh they have local groups all

359
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,620
over the place I know the local one here

360
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,420
meets once a month

361
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,880
uh I had their name I thought it was in

362
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,720
here

363
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,820
and there's one that's Loosely tied to

364
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,820
the federal tied to FEMA the radio

365
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,740
amateur civil emergency service a lot of

366
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,740
these things came out of

367
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,420
people just wanting to help

368
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,399
and then the military auxiliary radio

369
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,899
system I don't know as much about that

370
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:44,100
but it's supposed to be an interface

371
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,120
between the worldwide military

372
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,940
Communications and ham radio in the

373
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,959
event of

374
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,480
catastrophic communication failures

375
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,600
some of these examples uh September 11

376
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,260
2001 attacks the police and fire

377
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,940
repeater

378
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,160
Towers were on the top of

379
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,339
the north or south tower

380
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,699
colleague told me about it and uh

381
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,019
amateur radio operator stepped in to

382
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,420
assist in Communications with that same

383
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,440
with the other

384
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,899
Hurricane Katrina there was no power

385
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:18,180
anywhere and a generator underwater

386
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,699
doesn't generate much power

387
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:23,220
and all these things the communication

388
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,199
systems that you know relied on were

389
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,820
taken down and so amateur radio

390
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,579
operators stepped up to stepped up to

391
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:30,899
assist

392
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,720
Dr Elvis why do it at all

393
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,779
uh it's good for geeks I think uh buying

394
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,180
testing building soldering experimenting

395
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,620
there's always new stuff coming out

396
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,720
there is uh

397
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,060
old stuff all the vacuum tube radios

398
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,100
I've got two of them I'm still I still

399
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,560
Tinker with every now and then kits that

400
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,720
were made in the 70s that came in a big

401
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,760
box of capacitors and resistors and you

402
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,199
had to solder together

403
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,760
and that was how that was some of the

404
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,620
entry-level equipment now called boat

405
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,000
anchors because it's

406
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,800
I mean easily

407
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,440
this and up it's it's just a huge device

408
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,680
that something like this can do now more

409
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,839
efficiently

410
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,279
but there's just I think there's a

411
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,139
little bit of something for everyone

412
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:17,360
especially in in our Tech fields

413
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,620
uh if you're one of those that are into

414
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,079
uh computers like I said they mentioned

415
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,519
before there's digital modes where it's

416
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,040
just keyboard to keyboard contacts

417
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,500
and uh integration integrating your

418
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,180
computers to your radio so you know I

419
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,279
turn in dials and knobs and all these

420
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,959
things it's just

421
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,760
you type in what you want you move the

422
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,759
move the knobs with your mouse

423
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:41,579
a lot easier to to make the contacts

424
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:44,940
and uh if you're interested in more the

425
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,980
kind of Niche Niche groups you can

426
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,899
decode information from weather

427
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:52,259
satellites directly uh raw the enormous

428
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:53,820
raw images that can come in from the

429
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,880
satellites NASA information the search

430
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,160
for extraterrestrial

431
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,380
what's the I stand for

432
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,959
intelligence probably

433
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,819
you can receive those signals and

434
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,740
process them as well with

435
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:12,059
basic amateur radio equipment

436
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:15,780
and if you're into competitions like I

437
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,160
said mentioned earlier there's always a

438
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,500
contest running

439
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,179
it's hard to tell what is going on right

440
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,220
now the

441
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,179
qst magazine AR Pro posted by the

442
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,679
American radio relay leagues one of the

443
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,120
best sources for that I think it comes

444
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,340
with both digital and print if anybody

445
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,419
wants to take a look at any of this

446
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,720
there's always a project or something to

447
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,240
something to build and these these

448
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,039
magazines

449
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,059
and uh

450
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,400
so yeah there's qst magazines monthly

451
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,200
publication

452
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,780
uh emergencies if anybody remembers the

453
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,760
2012 the ratio

454
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,340
I know the two cell phone towers near my

455
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,700
house were completely blocked up but the

456
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,580
amateur radio repeater stayed active the

457
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,679
whole time people were given weather

458
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:06,840
updates and emergency response things

459
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,360
and and all that but we've proven that

460
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,120
uh cell phone tower is unreliable

461
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,260
now I enter we've seen some of the

462
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,280
malware events that has taken down isps

463
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,380
and who does anybody have a telephone

464
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,220
line anymore like a house phone

465
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,700
one two

466
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,100
and then the

467
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,500
the use is declining so maintenance is

468
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,820
going to decline everything's going to

469
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,380
an internet-based model so even that

470
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,880
service that was

471
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,520
formerly the most reliable is is still

472
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,320
declining

473
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,059
but uh there's no there's no

474
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:47,820
infrastructure in amateur radio

475
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,160
unless you're I mean repeaters yes but I

476
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,140
mean radio to radio there's there's

477
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,679
nothing there

478
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,539
where is ham radio it's all over the

479
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:59,580
place uh groups of Life like-minded

480
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,500
individuals research groups

481
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,900
uh the several hams involved in 304

482
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,220
Geeks

483
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,100
our survivalists and veterans

484
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,840
you know hard-pressed to find a true

485
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,460
survivalist without a handheld

486
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,380
transceiver even if just

487
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,740
to be paranoid and and listen he's got

488
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,059
something

489
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:19,440
and uh

490
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,299
almost all veterans

491
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,400
use the radio at some point that's what

492
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,380
really got me into it was I was an Army

493
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,460
Aviation

494
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,799
and the high frequency radio would

495
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,679
transmit uh GPS position uh we had

496
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,980
canned text messages to to send out you

497
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,840
know over the horizon it would bounce

498
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,039
off the

499
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,860
bionosphere propagation and uh that's

500
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,720
really what kind of sparked my interest

501
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,059
into it you're familiar everybody knows

502
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,520
that you get too far away from your

503
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,799
favorite radio station and you lose

504
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:52,020
signal but the high frequency rating

505
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,179
would bounce around and connect back to

506
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,360
base

507
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,900
uh you can get more into it in

508
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,880
conferences like this I know this is the

509
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,620
second time that secures WV has helped

510
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,660
had me for for this talk

511
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,820
and uh they used to do testing but I

512
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,320
don't think

513
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,460
if they're doing it they haven't

514
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,960
mentioned to me about it

515
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,780
uh the post-covered world uh testing I

516
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,559
think can be done online

517
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,380
but uh I'll have to look more into that

518
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,200
there's online forums Facebook uh slack

519
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,740
Reddit ham radio it's pretty popular uh

520
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,480
questions answers testing help there's

521
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,000
all kinds of information there

522
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,820
and uh the local Club

523
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,260
used to hold testing you're gonna have

524
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,520
to check on that just to double check

525
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,160
this before I even started

526
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,000
uh First Responders one of my

527
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,820
dad used to work in a uh

528
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,700
dispatch for hospital and after 9 11

529
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,820
when

530
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,559
they lost Communications a lot of First

531
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:58,440
Responders and dispatch operators

532
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,419
got into amateur radio so he was

533
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:02,460
licensed before before I was they they

534
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,039
keep and maintain an amateur radio setup

535
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,860
in the dispatch office

536
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,520
and uh anybody read the book World War Z

537
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,080
not the movie

538
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,460
the book far better

539
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,660
it's pretty good one of the things

540
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,760
learned from that was uh communication

541
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,000
is key uh the society collapses in a

542
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,919
zombie apocalypse and but I mean the the

543
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,620
Nations and organizations that stayed

544
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,020
whole and tried to maintain the best had

545
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,659
the best communication that's the big

546
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,740
lesson that I took from it

547
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,980
now licensing we mentioned before it's

548
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,140
uh it's a paid test through the Federal

549
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,620
Communications Commission

550
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,539
thought so blank on it

551
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,200
about 15 is the typical uh typical fee

552
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,580
that can go up and down depend on who's

553
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,580
hosting the test uh the entry level is

554
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,380
technician that's one of the easier it's

555
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,299
more of uh the testing is more rules and

556
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,820
regulations so you know what to transmit

557
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,640
and that's mostly limited to very high

558
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,700
frequency and above so uh

559
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,520
devices like this handhelds

560
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,299
not some of the larger long distance

561
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,100
radio ones

562
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,900
test isn't too difficult I figure all

563
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,200
out with ham radio for dummies

564
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,940
and that kind of gets your your feet wet

565
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,220
but the general license is

566
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,320
I think the most popular it gets you

567
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,000
into the high frequency work the long

568
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,700
distance the bigger antennas the digital

569
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,179
modes contesting

570
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,620
distance exchanges then uh amateur extra

571
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,720
I personally think is more popular

572
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,260
because you can get shorter customized

573
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,640
call signs

574
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,159
there's a formula for

575
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,280
who gets what depending on

576
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,980
your license status because the amateur

577
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,200
extra opens up a little bit more

578
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,200
frequency use but not a whole lot and

579
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,120
anybody can listen to any radio

580
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,559
frequency we just have to have the

581
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,960
license to transmit so just listening on

582
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,299
the amateur extra blocks is almost

583
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,460
always quiet I think people just want

584
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,140
the extra

585
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,440
call sign customization

586
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,780
but that's just me

587
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,780
uh self-study I've got a general

588
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,340
handbook and the ham radio for dummies

589
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,260
but there's all kinds of

590
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,900
mobile apps books

591
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,780
online cram sessions you can learn in

592
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,360
the clubs they'll they'll sit and read

593
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,299
through every single FCC question twice

594
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:43,679
you mark them read them then they'll go

595
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,940
right into the test

596
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,340
so you don't have to actually have to

597
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,980
no it just spit it back out

598
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,260
and uh I think YouTube is one of the

599
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,679
better ones if you're a multiple

600
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,440
method learner like me got to see it do

601
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,659
it hear it read it for it's actually

602
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:02,280
stick so

603
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,960
uh there's lots of different channels on

604
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,520
there one I'll recommend that at the end

605
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,100
is my favorite

606
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,020
uh the equipment part of actually

607
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,940
getting on the air it can be pretty

608
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,220
cheap to get into but as it as you get

609
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,780
into more

610
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,419
uh

611
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:20,039
tire and Equipment it gets very

612
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,679
expensive cheap handhelds ht's handheld

613
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,360
transmitter if I've said that already

614
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,220
that's what it stands for handheld

615
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,020
transmitter

616
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,120
uh cheapest and easiest way to get on

617
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,280
the air this one I think was 25 dollars

618
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,140
with a

619
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,720
an upgraded antenna but you can get into

620
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,240
local repeaters and talk to people all

621
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,380
over the valley with something like this

622
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,140
and I think it's fully illegal now

623
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,480
General friend upon before this can be

624
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,299
programmed to

625
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:53,039
FRS radios little handheld

626
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,960
walkie-talkies

627
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,760
you're not supposed to not supposed to

628
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,020
be able to do it I don't think the new

629
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,280
ones can do it now that's why I like

630
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,600
hanging on to this one

631
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,780
uh emergency situations or just greater

632
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,620
reach

633
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,419
it's fun to have

634
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:08,159
more capabilities

635
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,440
they can tune into Weather Radio and

636
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,580
again that's one of those things that

637
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,960
you can receive but you can't transmit

638
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,120
on those those frequencies

639
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,400
uh mobile units

640
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,600
anybody seen a CB citizens band radio

641
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,700
looks about like those mounted in your

642
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,340
car that's what I have in my my house is

643
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,559
my kind of base station it's just a

644
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,720
mobile radio a little more power a few

645
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,840
more uh bells and whistles

646
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,880
and uh

647
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,260
easier to interface with the computer

648
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,200
these can link into a computer but I had

649
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,419
a whole plan for a demonstration but I

650
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:43,860
couldn't find one of the specialty cords

651
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,140
I needed to link to the computer and so

652
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,820
that's not going to happen

653
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,159
and uh the larger base stations I mean

654
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,200
they can get into the thousands and

655
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,179
thousands of dollars but

656
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:55,860
uh they can reach the limit so the

657
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,840
frequency capabilities fully computer

658
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,740
integrated I mean if you want to reach

659
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,840
every corner of the world then you're

660
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,600
going to need the equipment to do so if

661
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,799
the conditions aren't right for it

662
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:12,419
oh with this equipment you get what you

663
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:15,840
pay for you can get a complete software

664
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,779
defined setup where it's all integrated

665
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,120
circuits there there's

666
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,700
uh all computer

667
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,580
controlled and ran or what I mentioned

668
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,039
before the boat anchor the vacuum tube

669
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,020
radios it's got its own kind of

670
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,880
following to keep these these old radios

671
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,500
still going I've got a couple of them

672
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,539
that I tinker with every now and then

673
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,580
parts are getting harder to find

674
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,620
uh there's there's a big market for

675
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,260
vacuum tubes and the guitar

676
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,740
industry I'm musically challenged I I

677
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,820
wouldn't know what they're for I guess

678
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,760
it sounds better I don't know

679
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,620
and uh

680
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,500
your antennas I've heard

681
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,919
anybody uh rifle shooters

682
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,960
gun nuts

683
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,059
you can put your hands up fine too they

684
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:04,380
say You're supposed to spend as much on

685
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,880
your scope as you are for the rifle

686
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,779
right

687
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:10,260
heard that same thing with antennas and

688
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,500
your radio uh the the best radio will

689
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,840
not perform well without a proper

690
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,140
antenna uh they're not difficult to make

691
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,539
you can buy very expensive High

692
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,520
performing ones again you get what you

693
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,100
pay for but in the end it's all it's all

694
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,620
radio frequency it's uh

695
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,239
it's all down to down to the math

696
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,799
and that's where it gets way beyond my

697
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,480
skill because uh

698
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,340
the technician it's all rules and

699
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,100
regulation the general exam it's about

700
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,900
half and half you get into amateur extra

701
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,320
it's into the theory of amateur radio I

702
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,299
don't know of any clubs that do the cram

703
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,820
session for amateur extra because they

704
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,000
want you to actually know the theory of

705
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,320
the theory and the the physics of

706
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,320
electromagnetic radiation

707
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,760
small resources mentioned before it's my

708
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,860
favorite one ham radio for dummies

709
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,100
anybody interested and welcome to flip

710
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,900
through the book I'm probably going to

711
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,940
leave it in the book exchange later

712
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,520
just a great place to start I got a gift

713
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,440
card for Christmas I bought that book

714
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,419
and an older model of these radios and

715
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:22,679
that was my first step into amateur

716
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:23,820
radio

717
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,679
uh Pinterest of all things anybody else

718
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,059
use Pinterest

719
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:30,299
lots of amateur radio product projects

720
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:33,120
on there cheat sheets flash cards

721
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,659
uh antenna builds videos it's a good

722
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:38,520
place for a lot of it uh my favorite

723
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,500
YouTube channel relating to amateur

724
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,779
radio is uh Dave casler

725
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:46,020
uh call us on ke0og

726
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,600
calls his fans auggies he's got all

727
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,600
kinds of videos explaining testing and

728
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,100
antenna modeling

729
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,320
what it costs to get into amateur radio

730
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,000
and all these just about everything you

731
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,860
could you could uh want to know about

732
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,900
amateur radio he's got it on there he's

733
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,000
always going to ask Dave Series where

734
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,500
he's just answering

735
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,179
our questions

736
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:09,539
uh the ARL the American radio relay

737
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,720
League exam manuals

738
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,700
one of these is the one I use for

739
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,840
General

740
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,640
well done through but if anybody wants

741
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,380
to flip through it

742
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,360
have at it

743
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,080
the license has changed every four years

744
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,179
three years they rotate

745
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:28,919
so I think that one's out of date now

746
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:32,159
but it doesn't change all that much

747
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,340
probably just a scam to sell books

748
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,779
to delete that on YouTube they're gonna

749
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:37,860
get at me

750
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,020
and then qst magazine another another

751
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,960
place for uh information you don't have

752
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,120
to be uh

753
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,820
licensed to subscribe to their magazine

754
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,840
or

755
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,000
be a member of the American radio relay

756
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,779
League

757
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:53,640
but there's always a project in there to

758
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,899
build there's always interesting

759
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:56,700
information on some of the D Expeditions

760
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,340
or these places people go

761
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,899
just to play with the radios I mean

762
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:04,799
Antarctic Antarctica some insane remote

763
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,559
Islands out in the Pacific

764
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:11,159
the the the I mean passport requirements

765
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:13,200
and trying to get license in these

766
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,140
obscure countries there were one country

767
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,059
might claim territory over this island

768
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:19,620
but they really want to get that stamp

769
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,000
on their

770
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,799
uh

771
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,380
postcards so just the links they go to I

772
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,059
just find it that's interesting

773
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,460
that's all I've got anybody have any

774
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,500
questions

775
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,580
concerns comments

776
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,418
criticisms

777
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:41,159
importance of the FCC put the line

778
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:43,500
between what's encryption

779
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,539
open source uh if you if you create a

780
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:51,000
encoded or encrypted solution you have

781
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,500
to present the uh method by which it's

782
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,640
done

783
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,279
so everybody knows how to decode base64

784
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,899
now it's pretty well pretty well out

785
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:03,240
there but uh I mean I don't think

786
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,700
anybody's transmitting in shot 256 that

787
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,539
I

788
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,760
I'm aware of there was a real

789
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,260
interesting article where somebody sent

790
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,880
Bitcoin over amateur radio from

791
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,820
California to Canada

792
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,240
uh but uh that that ran a foul with some

793
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,940
FCC laws it was a fun read though

794
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,320
they it's

795
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,360
whatever you can design whatever you can

796
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,580
come up with they can just be your your

797
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,200
name handwritten it could be something

798
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,620
Fancy with your your call sign your name

799
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,700
the the radio you use the transmission

800
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,260
strength that anything in between

801
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,140
right you'll you'll make a call out on

802
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,760
the radio and somebody will answer hey

803
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,340
I'm in Minnesota nice to meet you you do

804
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,200
your cards yeah I mean you have to

805
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,820
initiate the conversation with your call

806
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,899
sign and transmit every 15 minutes

807
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:05,340
if you're talking

808
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,740
so I mean but but all everybody's call

809
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,380
sign is registered with FCC anyway so

810
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,179
it's easy to find their their

811
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:13,320
information

812
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,880
a lot of these things are done by the

813
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,320
computer anyway so you just type in

814
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,080
their call sign it pops right up

815
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,240
and there's a

816
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,640
website and ended up and a standalone

817
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,440
application called logbook of the world

818
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,600
where it's all done digitally you'll

819
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,659
send images of your whatever

820
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:33,299
postcard you've uh you've designed

821
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,220
and everybody's profiles in there it's

822
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,360
like a radio social media not quite as

823
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,580
I guess open and

824
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,039
visually interesting is Facebook or one

825
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:44,940
of these others but that's that's

826
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,779
basically what it is

827
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:56,460
climbing named uh named Peaks or

828
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,200
it

829
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,899
somewhere on the air hiked to the top of

830
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:03,659
a mountain and you can make it be known

831
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:05,520
that you're hiking it or

832
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,279
any of these uh state parks it's common

833
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,720
as Seneca Rocks you know the highest

834
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,360
peak in West Virginia

835
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,419
uncommon among this amount on I can't I

836
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:16,260
don't think there's anybody up there

837
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,620
today but it's uh you're I always loved

838
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,000
this one around when we're camping with

839
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,559
state parks used to listen to see who's

840
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,659
who's out doing what

841
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:27,779
uh it's really popular at watoga state

842
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,580
park because there's a bunch of a bunch

843
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,200
of Peaks out that way and they can reach

844
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,179
really far but you have to be careful

845
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,399
not to run a file with a radio telescope

846
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:37,320
the Greenback Observatory

847
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,600
so we have that's just one concern it's

848
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,340
it's a little more difficult to make the

849
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,519
Peaks make the contacts and uh

850
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,860
with that involved

851
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,639
added challenge

852
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,039
not not very not around here at least I

853
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,840
don't know of any I know the local the

854
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,880
local club that I used to

855
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,219
attend and do it very often but maybe

856
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,080
once a year that's kind of more

857
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,080
specialized

858
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,960
something there yeah we'll still set it

859
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,639
up on a weekend somebody go hide their

860
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,639
their transmitter and then say all right

861
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,719
go find it winner gets a get surprise

862
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,980
practice for the

863
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,960
FCC tattletail Squad I think

864
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,820

865
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,199
Observers

866
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,000
hams that just sit around and listen for

867
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,580
violations and then try to find who did

868
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,260
it

869
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,940

872
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,659
