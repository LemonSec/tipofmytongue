00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,260
the big round for when when I'm done

18 years working for a little German

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,860
company called Siemens I did a lot of

29
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,240
things everything from database

30
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,939
Administration to programming to

31
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,979
networking to network security building

32
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,159
vpns built up our whole infrastructure

33
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,500
for remote access for monitoring our

34
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,479
power plants we're kind of like the

35
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,659
OnStar for power plants back then

36
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:38,340
and uh got into security and somebody

37
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,439

38
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,479
I went my CI what and that was 14 years

39
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,280
ago and so now I've been working in

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,439
security ever since and about three

41
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,619
years ago actually three years ago today

42
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,380
I started at no before so today's my

43
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,520

[Applause]

47
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,759
let's hope that doesn't keep doing that

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,600
um

49
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,000
so yeah with being a no before pretty

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,560
well I get to talk about cyber security

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,379
all the time every day everywhere I do

52
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,480
it at college with the students kind of

53
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,120
helping that next generation of uh

54
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,459
professionals who in here is a student

55
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:21,840
not a student alike but a college

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,959
student Okay cool so those of you that

57
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,400
had their hand up everybody else make

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,080
sure you connect with them because one

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,400
of the things that I strive with my

60
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,379
chapter and one of the things we always

61
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,180
talk about is getting connected getting

62
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,280
connected with the people in your

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,900
community because you never know who

64
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,040
you're going to meet one day that's

65
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,780
going to help you get that job down the

66
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,120
road because my job at no before is a

67
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,340
result of Eric Crone and Javad Malik

68
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,040
both are other Advocates both came to me

69
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,660
and I've known them for years meeting at

70
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,519
conferences became good friends and they

71
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:51,780
said hey we have this opening for an

72
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,280
evangelist you want to come and do this

73
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,819
I'm like heck yeah let's go and lo and

74
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,920
behold but because of networking and

75
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,660
getting to know folks and meeting the

76
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,760
people in your community and in this

77
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,980
industry uh it certainly goes a long way

78
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,080
so I encourage all the students in here

79
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,599
get to know the other folks and meant

80
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,800
whether through mentoring or whatever

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,840
else so

82
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,180
um I also run a podcast I'm I produce

83
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,040
our security masterminds podcast to know

84
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,379
before lots of fun with that uh our new

85
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,120
episode came out today but I'll talk

86
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,800
about that later on

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,720
um of the working Professionals in here

88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,900
anybody have no before you or use no

89
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,159
before for security awareness training

90
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,599
cool all right

91
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,420
so most or some of you so the rest of

92
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,900
you potential customers great now

93
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,700
um my job is in sales and that's one of

94
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,900
the reasons I love this job is I'm not

95
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,280
here to sell you anything my job here is

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,840
to light the firing and what we're

97
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,040
talking about today with regard to

98
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,620
ransomware and Conti but with being at

99
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,480
no before the big thing for me is

100
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,640
enabling people to make smarter security

101
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,920
decisions every day bottom line plain

102
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,060
and simple that's what I want to do

103
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,620
whether it's working professionals

104
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,120
whether it's students whether it's kids

105
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,319
whether it's

106
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,540
we say senior citizens but I like to say

107
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,879
the life experienced because they don't

108
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,260
like being called senior citizens I

109
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,519
guess

110
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,080
but getting them to make smarter

111
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,060
security decisions and so it starts with

112
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,000
all of us and helping educate uh you

113
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,340
know we hear the phrase

114
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,320
humans are the weakest are the weakest

115
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,760
link you know they're always clicking on

116
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,918
links opening up attachments and for me

117
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,860
and I throw this back at it and infosec

118
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,240
folks when they say that is like they're

119
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,220
the biggest attack Vector if you think

120
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,419
they're the weakest link then we're not

121
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,220
educating them enough so

122
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,840
um that's certainly what I try to do

123
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,960
when I'm uh out and about and visiting

124
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,620
so today the the presentation and I've

125
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,759
been told I've got like two and a half

126
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,320
hours which is great because I've got

127
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,199
400 slides to get through no

128
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,340
no

129
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,220
um I've got another 50 minutes to go so

130
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,540
um what we're going to go through and

131
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,000
talk about today is ransomware and

132
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,580
specifically looking at the ransomware

133
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,520
uh that the Conti group we're doing

134
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,040
earlier this year based off of the chat

135
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,020
information that got released and other

136
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,240
information that's been made available

137
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,979
um over the last couple years

138
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,800
and just to give you some insight with

139
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,960
regards to how they do their attacks how

140
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,199
they operate uh Society likes to think

141
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,720
that the hackers and I like to say cyber

142
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,160
criminals because hackers are good

143
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,180
people too

144
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,620
hackers are people that like to take

145
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,419
things apart figure out how they work

146
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,460
and put them back together again

147
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,180
so Society has the stigma of the hackers

148
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,620
or the people sitting in their basement

149
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,479
their parents basements with the hoodies

150
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,880
on and that's certainly not the case

151
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,400
that we've found with regards to conti

152
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,259
and the other cyber criminal groups that

153
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,520
are out there

154
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,740
so when we look at you know kind of The

155
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,780
New Normal when like I said I joined no

156
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,639
before three years ago and it was in

157
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,699
November of 2019 where we started seeing

158
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,419
a shift with regards to ransomware

159
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:54,240
ransomware has been around since 1989 Dr

160
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,020
Joseph Papp did one where he put out a

161
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,720
um he had a floppy disk those of you I

162
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,520
see some people in here know what a

163
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,660
floppy disk and I think some other

164
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,699
people in here probably were born after

165
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,180
floppy disks uh were stopped being used

166
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,100
but he had a floppy disk and he was

167
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,780
going to a conference it was back then

168
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,180
in the late 80s age was a huge epidemic

169
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,280
going on and he showed up to one of

170
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,720
these conferences he had 50 of these

171
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,060
floppy disks and he showed up to this uh

172
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,759
age conference and he had a document on

173
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,120
there at that point I think it was um it

174
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,759
wasn't word it was Word Perfect doc but

175
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,620
he had written some code that was behind

176
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,020
it that if somebody put the floppy disk

177
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,580
in their computer it would run a program

178
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,620
and it would keep track of how many

179
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,900
times that program ran when the program

180
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,880
got up to about where the application

181
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,259
had been opened the word doc had been

182
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,680
opened about 50 times it he then went

183
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,280
through and encrypted and I do that in

184
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,600
air quotes for a particular reason

185
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,120
because what he did is he just changed

186
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,940
the extensions on all the files so all

187
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,539
the doc or or

188
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:02,400
WPF files PDF whatever it was it just

189
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,919
changed the extension back in 89 a lot

190
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,780
of people that were just starting to use

191
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,039
computers didn't really have a good

192
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,960
understanding of the extensions and so

193
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,280
they thought their files were encrypted

194
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,199
and he gave you he left you a little

195
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,000
note that said hey if you want your

196
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,139
files decrypted send 400 or 500 to this

197
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,080
PO Box in Panama

198
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,240
and so the first time he went to go

199
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,460
collect his money from the PO Box in

200
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,759
Panama the FBI were waiting for him

201
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,639
uh interestingly enough he got off on an

202
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,360
insanity plea I I'm not he ends up uh he

203
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,860
ended up dying I think about 10 years

204
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,080
ago but he uh ended up doing a whole

205
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,819
study on butterflies after that how he

206
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,979
goes from one to the other but that's

207
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,479
kind of that first case of ransomware

208
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,580
and it's come a long way once we had the

209
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,380
change with

210
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,419
cryptocurrency coming out once Bitcoin

211
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:52,620
starts coming on the scene cyber

212
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,240
criminals are realizing hey we instead

213
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,460
of using asking for gift cards or asking

214
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,800
for Western Union wire transfers we can

215
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,720
get them to do Bitcoin because at least

216
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,139
then it's not very easily uh can be

217
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,240
traced we can have a certain an amenity

218
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,880
with it and then once we get it in we

219
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,080
can then start moving the money around

220
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,720
between all the different exchanges so

221
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,460
Bitcoin comes in they're using

222
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,039
cryptocurrency now for the ransoms but

223
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,000
even then early 2010s teens they are

224
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,819
encrypting the systems and they're

225
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:24,720
getting but they're doing it very

226
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,520
quickly they're getting in

227
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,319
they uh they get into the system whether

228
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,979
through RDP whether exposed systems that

229
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,080
are unpatched whether phishing social

230
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,219
engineering

231
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,219
and they get in uh find the data drop

232
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,080
the malware and off they go

233
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,700
some of them were doing it as quick as

234
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,399
30 minutes from time of getting into

235
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,860
dropping the malware the ransomware and

236
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,560
getting out after a while everyone's so

237
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,120
everyone's talking oh my gosh you know

238
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,500
make sure you get your backups make sure

239
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,060
you got your backups have backups and

240
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,160
you'll be all right from ransomware oh

241
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,200
yeah don't forget to test the backups

242
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,940
because a lot of times people would go

243
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,640
and recover from their backups and they

244
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,620
would be missing six months or it would

245
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,899
it would fail on them

246
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,899
so now you've got them coming in it's

247
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,339
more of a nuisance attack with

248
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,680
ransomware because it's it's it you lose

249
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,540
one system or a couple systems then we

250
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,320
get wannacryan 20 2017 and then it

251
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,700
escalates with worms and so they're

252
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,380
getting they're evolving the ransomware

253
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,360
game as they go along

254
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,420
then we get to November of 2019 and we

255
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,880
start seeing a lot of changes there with

256
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,220
Maize with klopp

257
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,560
um Revel was on this was coming on the

258
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,420
scene as well and what ended up

259
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,040
happening was is they were getting into

260
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,560
your system and now they start

261
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,540
exfiltrating your data now they start

262
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,640
looking at okay let's take your data and

263
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,399
hold that for ransom and this evolves

264
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,140
and starts changing the game completely

265
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,720
now we're to the point where they're

266
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,339
doing multiple types of extortions

267
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,320
they're coming in they're stealing the

268
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,480
databases they're stealing client lists

269
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,580
employee information they're going after

270
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,500
c-suite they're actually contacting the

271
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,180
c-suite they're contacting employees

272
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,040
that work for the organization saying

273
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,899
hey we've got your data if you give us

274
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,600
300 bucks we will uh we'll delete the

275
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,980
information

276
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,779
because if the organization's not going

277
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,180
to pay you even had some doctors uh

278
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,680
medical practices it was in South

279
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,920
Florida a plastic surgeon where the uh

280
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,959
the ransomware group got in stole all

281
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,760
the patient information they got like

282
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,680
X-rays and all kinds of sensitive

283
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,660
information and they went to the doctor

284
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,279
and said all right hey you're gonna you

285
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,440
know it's you know three thousand ten

286
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,700
thousand fifty thousand whatever the

287
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,640
ransom was and they didn't want to pay

288
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,860
so then the the Cyber criminal said okay

289
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,080
so then they went after the patients and

290
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,580
they said to the patients we've got all

291
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,019
this data on you and this guy was a

292
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,820
plastic surgeon so no doubt they've got

293
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,339
before and after pictures

294
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:49,980
and they basically said pay us give us

295
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,380
300 bucks and we'll delete your data and

296
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,820
that's kind of the extent of where they

297
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,220
are now now as we got at the end of last

298
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,100
year with Q4 we saw we started seeing a

299
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,899
decline and everyone's thinking all

300
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,399
right we gotta ransomware beat you know

301
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,320
we'd start to decline and then in the

302
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,180
new year it ran back up again I think

303
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,320
they were just taken off for Christmas

304
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,399
but they they were the increase comes up

305
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,560
but while we're not seeing as many we're

306
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,300
seeing more targeted types of attacks

307
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,160
we're seeing Target specific to

308
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,380
organizations going after supply chain

309
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,300
going after organizations that provide a

310
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,980
lot of services you know we think back

311
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,140
to solarwinds a couple you know right in

312
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,060
the middle of the pandemic uh but the

313
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,339
solar winds with attacking the supply

314
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:30,959
chain and being able to get into so many

315
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,880
organizations cyber criminals are

316
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,079
starting to do that

317
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,660
as well but what ends up cropping out of

318
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,779
that is what we have is ransomware as a

319
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,600
service you know you've got a lot of a

320
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,800
lot of these different groups that have

321
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,540
the expertise but now you get to the

322
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,980
point where it's like okay I don't need

323
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,899
to know how to you know launch the

324
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,820
ransomware malware I don't need all I

325
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,620
need to do is provide a list of names or

326
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,959
email addresses and they can have the

327
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,700
whole application that can do it so now

328
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,860
it makes it even easier for me to launch

329
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,600
a ransomware attack against an

330
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,820
organization where you've got like menus

331
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,620
and then you've got different tiers that

332
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,720
are set up for those you can sit there

333
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,519
and you know depending on how much money

334
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,320
or how much how much of the program

335
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,820
you're going to use will depend on how

336
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,899
much you get

337
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,180
and you know to the point where it's

338
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,579
like all right we'll get you get 70 of

339
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,440
the money but we're keeping 30 for you

340
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,120
to use the tool

341
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,339
so it makes it a lot easier for the

342
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,260
Cyber criminals out there that don't

343
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,839
need a lot of technical experience a lot

344
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,880
of technical expertise

345
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,200
um and they've even got some of them

346
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,060
even have YouTube videos uh Philadelphia

347
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,920
one of the groups has their own YouTube

348
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,540
video that you can find it was out in

349
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,480
2017 that demoed how to actually use the

350
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,700
program so these groups actually even

351
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,459
have their own marketing folks as well

352
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,620
has anybody experienced the ransomware

353
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,180
attack

354
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,220
that wants to admit it got a couple okay

355
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,320
cool thank you for being honest so what

356
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,639
I'm going to show you here real quick

357
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,680
it's playing good

358
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,899
um this is a video that I recorded it

359
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,700
with my class that I teach and every

360
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,660
semester I do a uh section on ransomware

361
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,000
and I decided one year what happens if I

362
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,079
could you know if I could actually

363
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,180
launch a ransomware attack on my own

364
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,639
virtual machine and show them what it's

365
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,560
like and so that's what I'm doing here

366
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,120
and what you see here in the the folder

367
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,540
in the front is the ransomware samples

368
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,399
that I downloaded out of the through

369
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,680
torrent and I love it I launched the

370
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,120
application and then it goes are you

371
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,380
sure you want to run this because this

372
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,360
doesn't look like it's safe

373
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,459
so I launched the program here at this

374
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,279
point and I've got about 40 gigabytes

375
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,040
worth of data on this hard drive and you

376
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,019
can see the icons and they just changed

377
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,139
so pretty well less than 10 seconds it

378
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:43,200
took to encrypt the data on this virtual

379
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,000
machine about like I said 40 gigabytes

380
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,579
of data and it goes through

381
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,500
and I actually had a I don't do it in

382
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,940
this video but I actually had a text

383
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,459
file on the desktop that got encrypted I

384
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,019
opened it up and the students could see

385
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,000
yep all the data inside is actually

386
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,459
encrypted you can access it I show them

387
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:00,839
you get the little ransomware note

388
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,579
because cyber criminals want to get paid

389
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,920
and so there they end up they give you

390
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,360
the note they give you the instructions

391
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,339
they give you the key you got to go get

392
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:09,720
the tour browser

393
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,060
you got to go get some Bitcoin uh or

394
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,560
ethereum or however they want to get

395
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,660
paid they give you the address and they

396
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,519
give you all that to you I mean it's

397
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,019
more customer service than you get with

398
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,779
some other organizations that are legit

399
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,880
I mean some ransomware groups even have

400
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,980
a online Call Center that you can chat

401
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,800
with people online to get

402
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,380
um to get whatever it is pay up

403
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,600
negotiate or do whatever so pretty well

404
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,579
within about a minute my whole system

405
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,680
has now been infected uh hit with the

406
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,380
ransomware so it moves pretty quick and

407
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,180
when we have dwell times and systems

408
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,480
that are you know 80 days and this gets

409
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,240
done in a matter of minutes so

410
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,279
just wanted to give everybody an Insight

411
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,760
on how quick it actually happens

412
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,860
um there is technology out there you

413
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,959
know the big I know we got sofos here

414
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,060
you know that they can stop a lot of

415
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,139
this you know they see the files

416
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:02,399
changing so they can stop it on one

417
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,079
system before it spreads and gets around

418
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,980
to other systems so that just to kind of

419
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,899
Baseline everybody there with regards to

420
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,760
ransomware now the title of the

421
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,620
presentation you saw is called uh

422
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,220
ransomware Ransom war and ransomware so

423
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,139
what I'm really curious is does anybody

424
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,660
know how the hackers got away from the

425
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,279
FBI

426
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,620
yeah they ran somewhere

427
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,420
thank you thank you thank you very much

428
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,339
I'll be here all week

429
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,459
um

430
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,440
I'm not going to confirm or deny there's

431
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,940
more of those in this presentation so

432
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,040
you just kind of have to wait and see

433
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,079
all right

434
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:44,519
and I have plenty more that's inside

435
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,079
this deck I have a whole YouTube channel

436
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,540
of me telling dad jokes so I'll share

437
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,639
that with you at the end as well

438
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,860
um I have a sign in my office at home

439
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,920
that says dad jokes told here and my

440
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,959
daughters gave it to me so it's it's a

441
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,220
you know you know you're doing right

442
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,440
when the kids give you things to support

443
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,740
your crazy habit so anyway so we're

444
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,699
gonna go through we're gonna talk about

445
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,620
Conti kind of they're overviewing their

446
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,440
organization how they uh how they get

447
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,139
things their tactics uh in techniques

448
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,519
and and procedures how they were doing

449
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,380
their ttps and then we'll talk about

450
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,240
some defensive things and also some of

451
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,519
the reasoning behind uh why they did

452
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,920
what they did with regards to

453
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,160
the ransomware attacks so let's look at

454
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,779
Conti overall

455
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:31,380
Conti is a russian-based

456
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:31,980
um

457
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,779
cyber criminal group essentially bottom

458
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,519
line plain and simple

459
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,139
um they were making well over a hundred

460
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:39,120
million dollars a year in the years that

461
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,339
they were operating uh

462
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,800
their biggest Heist I think was 180

463
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,019
million they got out of one organization

464
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:49,560
with regards to that uh with a lot of

465
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,820
the Cyber criminal groups that are out

466
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,800
there especially in ransomware they all

467
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,360
have particular sectors they like to

468
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,380
Target

469
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,899
when you look at crowdstrike's got a

470
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,639
great map that they have available you

471
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,259
can Google it and go check it out where

472
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,779
it shows all the different groups and

473
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,160
what they like to Target whether it's

474
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,140
energy whether it's in critical

475
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,880
infrastructure whether it's Healthcare

476
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,220
education government systems

477
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,079
each of these different groups have

478
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,540
their own particular sector they like to

479
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,640
Target we'll hit anybody but usually

480
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,740
they find that they will go after a

481
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,559
certain sector to get what they want

482
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,959
with regards to it

483
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,780
what we have here is kind of a breakdown

484
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,220
of how the different groups were doing

485
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,640
monetary wise

486
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,200
Conti basically had over a thousand had

487
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,160
hit over a thousand different

488
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,700
organizations by January of this year

489
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,919
and the payouts were always in the

490
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,080
millions and millions of dollars

491
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,299
um I'm going to talk about a little bit

492
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,039
later on but Costa Rica was one of the

493
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,320
last big ones that they hit

494
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,240
the actual country

495
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,120
uh the government of Costa Rica when we

496
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,160
look at who they were targeting a lot of

497
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,960
the times it was the U.S 50 percent of

498
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,700
the attacks here are looking at U.S

499
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,220
Canada the UK European basically the

500
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,320
West uh there's a statement I'm going to

501
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,360
show you here in a second from them

502
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,919
which kind of explains what they were

503
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,440
doing but when we look at the industry

504
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,600
they were going after manufacturing

505
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,700
legal retail

506
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,700
construction and finance now when we

507
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,020
look at

508
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,120
how organizations do based on a sector

509
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,860
Finance does really really well because

510
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,780
they've been trying to keep the bad guys

511
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,580
cyber criminals out for years because

512
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,500
cyber criminals are in it for one thing

513
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,720
and one thing only and that's to make

514
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,620
money

515
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,320
and so you know why do bank robbers rob

516
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,419
banks because that's where the money is

517
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,039
and so cyber criminals like to go after

518
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,419
the finance that's why we've seen so

519
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,400
many attacks recently on crypto change

520
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,380
extern

521
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,500
crypto exchange uh organizations because

522
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,880
that's where the money is and they can

523
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,919
go in and you know gain access steal

524
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,539
credentials and and look at stealing the

525
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,280
money but for Conti they were going

526
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,039
after the manufacturing organizations

527
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,140
um Law Offices you know a lot of these

528
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,220
these particular sectors don't have

529
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,160
a lot a a deep

530
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,260
um set of Information Security

531
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,940
Professionals in the organization RIT

532
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,360
they might be using an MSP or a managed

533
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,799
service providers

534
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,080
to handle all the I.T and security stuff

535
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,720
uh and so for them they they found that

536
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,760
they were able to get get access into

537
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,100
those particular organizations and so

538
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,660
continue to Target them manufacturing

539
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,640
being the big one so

540
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,440
uh

541
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,440
then on February 24th that's when things

542
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,020
changed as we know that's when we had

543
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,000
the the beginning of the the Ukraine and

544
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,760
or when Russia marched into Ukraine uh

545
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,220
and the start of the

546
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,200
Ukraine Russia War that's going on

547
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,380
the next day we get Conti coming out and

548
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,559
defending Russia and basically saying we

549
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,059
we fully support the Russian government

550
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,980
and what they're doing if anyone attacks

551
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,679
Russia we will strike back

552
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,419
um and

553
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:58,799
I think there's some people in their

554
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,919
organization weren't too keen on that

555
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:03,179
but essentially they ended up coming out

556
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:06,600
the next day and going okay well we're

557
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,220
not allying with any particular

558
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,039
government per se but we are going

559
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,840
against all the Western War mongers

560
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,340
because of what America stands for

561
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,679
later on I'm going to show you a uh an

562
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,400
interview uh with one of with a one of

563
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,380
the ransomware operators

564
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,640
and they have a comment in there which

565
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,140
is hysterical and but I don't want to

566
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,640
spoil the surprise

567
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,320
um so basically they're going through

568
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,780
and they're saying that you know we're

569
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,640
not allying with Russia but we are

570
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,440
against you know anything that goes on

571
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,080
in the west because they don't like it

572
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,980
uh what ends up happening after this

573
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,799
the next day on February 27th is we have

574
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,900
this Twitter account that pops up called

575
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,320
Conti leaks and they basically released

576
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,840
160

577
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,620
000 uh entries with regards to uh their

578
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,240
chat program their internal chat program

579
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,799
that they used in Conti which was called

580
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,179
Jabber

581
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,160
they released all of it

582
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,320
um and then they started posting all the

583
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,240
files and having links using an

584
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,340
anonymous file service they started

585
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,980
posting all of the the data that was out

586
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,860
there and from that we got a an

587
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,580
excellent glimpse into the world of the

588
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,860
Cyber criminal ransomware operators how

589
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,660
they were operating what they were doing

590
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,820
how they were set up

591
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,280
uh and essentially

592
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,380
um with these 160 000 internal messages

593
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,360
they went all the way back to January of

594
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,280
21 all the way through to pretty well

595
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,980
that day they were able to uh release

596
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,900
all that information along with data

597
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,340
relating to the source code for their

598
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,400
malware uh videos

599
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,720
um pretty well everything that they were

600
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,940
using to operate with regards to their

601
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,380
their environment

602
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,720
so when we look at Conti they were

603
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,159
essentially a ransomware as a service

604
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:55,559
group they were providing the tools and

605
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,440
capabilities for cyber criminals to

606
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,240
provide the email addresses or the

607
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,820
access into an organization and then

608
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,919
these guys would take over they would or

609
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,659
and they would have their software that

610
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,520
would be able to go in so they were

611
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,380
always managing the malware they had

612
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,539
their ransomware malicious software that

613
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,980
would be in there they were always

614
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,700
updating it because uh as we've seen

615
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,980
pretty well over the years when you've

616
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,200
got cyber criminals coming in with their

617
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,360
antivirus then the patterns get updated

618
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,580
by the antivirus providers the EDR

619
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,320
providers so then they've got to update

620
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,000
so they were it's constantly a cat and

621
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,400
mouse game and so they had people that

622
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,600
were going through and updating that

623
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,820
maintaining the onion website so they

624
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,460
could post all the information that they

625
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,659
had stolen

626
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,760
uh they had their Affiliates you know

627
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,080
you think of this like a business

628
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,460
because that's one of the things that

629
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,860
came out of this was this group operated

630
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,340
like a small to medium business and they

631
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,280
had an HR they had marketing

632
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,020
uh they even had like a partner program

633
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,299
where they'd have a folks affiliated

634
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,100
with them that would go out and get that

635
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,659
access for them

636
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:03,780
but when we look at a breakdown of the

637
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,120
of the chats and this is kind of like a

638
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,860
mind map of all the different uh

639
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,440
Communications of everybody and what we

640
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,720
had here you have a variety of different

641
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,400
folks you've got Stern

642
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,500
who's doing a lot of the talking in here

643
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,120
and pretty well he was the leader of the

644
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,880
organization and you've got Defender one

645
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,620
of the tech administrators you got

646
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,780
Berkeley who's the developer doing r d

647
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,539
work you had mango who was kind of like

648
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:31,260
a team lead and then you had Boz who uh

649
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,360
another lead

650
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,100
one of the things that when I first got

651
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,720
into

652
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,500
uh into I.T many many years ago back in

653
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,200
the 90s one of the first jobs I had was

654
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,360
working at a tech call center I worked

655
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,860
for an outsourcer we did tech support

656
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,600
for Dell

657
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,880
and the turnover rate in that place was

658
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,919
quite high but I managed to stay there

659
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,020
for about three years because the

660
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,460
building was only 10 minutes from my

661
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,140
house and any other job I was getting

662
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,940
was always on the other side of town and

663
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,220
not for any more money so I ended up

664
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,539
staying with this organization for about

665
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:06,659
three years and worked my way up and as

666
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,179
I look at the the business model for

667
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,220
this I see a lot of similarities to what

668
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,679
my time was like working at this call

669
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,360
center working at the Dell tech support

670
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,280
call center

671
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,860
and you know you have these different

672
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,780
groups you have just like any

673
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,640
organization you got an HR you've got

674
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,620
your coders your testers you got your

675
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,539
sys admins you know people that are

676
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,460
maintaining the systems overall with

677
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,260
regards to the web servers and and their

678
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,059
other and their where they're storing

679
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:34,440
their data

680
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,299
um you get your code reversers you've

681
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:39,539
got your researchers pen testers you've

682
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,039
got folks that are doing is doing ocean

683
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,500
work and then of course you have your

684
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,360
third party so even these organizations

685
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,700
have third party uh groups they're

686
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,260
working with that handle the spamming

687
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,419
the different uh Bots that we're using

688
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,059
whether it was trickbot arima Tech so

689
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,039
they're collaborating just like a

690
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,360
smaller medium business that we would

691
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,600
have in the everyday world

692
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,480
for me looking at this

693
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,179
when it came to you know these different

694
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:07,559
groups and looking at it with my

695
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,539
experience at a call center you know you

696
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,700
had people that your level one tax and

697
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,380
then you had your level two text and

698
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,419
then you'd have your level three and the

699
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:16,679
same thing applies within these

700
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,500
organizations within Conti they had 60

701
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,880
to 100 people

702
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,980
and essentially you would have them

703
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,240
going through and you'd have your one

704
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,740
folks that would get you access into the

705
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,360
organization then you'd have the other

706
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,620
people that would come along and they

707
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,720
would be doing the level one uh

708
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,700
exploitation doing the lateral moves

709
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,980
throughout the network then they would

710
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,299
be doing other you'd have your level

711
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:37,919
three ones if they ran into a brick wall

712
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,260
and so on and so forth so you've got all

713
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,140
these different levels of expertise uh

714
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,940
as well as recruiting you've got an HR

715
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,440
department going out looking for people

716
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,179
to come and work

717
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,860
and we would always think that oh my

718
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,360
gosh the level of sophistication that

719
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,220
must be on this with regards to these

720
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,179
folks

721
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,159
um isn't as quite as high as we might

722
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,140
think that it is

723
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,000
um this is all information that we're

724
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,740
finding out based within the chats the

725
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,000
communications between the different

726
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,340
groups

727
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,860
and essentially realizing that holy cow

728
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,200
this is just like any other type of

729
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,659
business yeah I apologize the lights

730
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:14,460
kind of make it difficult to see on the

731
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,039
dark but basically this is a chat one of

732
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,380
the snapshots of the chat but this is

733
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,120
focusing more on where they want to

734
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,799
harvest the data this is early days for

735
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,419
them where they're they just want to get

736
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:25,980
out there get as much data as they can

737
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,480
rather than targeting specific

738
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,340
organizations

739
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,620
um and their look and basically this was

740
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,000
a conversation with regards to a

741
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,520
particular organization the the name was

742
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,580
mask this came from Orange defense when

743
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,700
they went through and did their analysis

744
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,679
and basically coming back and saying

745
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,940
that

746
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,340
um this particular organization they're

747
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,380
looking just to get as much data as they

748
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,900
can maybe we can get it and then they

749
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,760
decide to move on

750
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,580
it's not all virtual so with this

751
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,039
particular conversation you know

752
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,860
they had offices they're not just all

753
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,480
working from home and sitting in their

754
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,039
parents basements no there were actual

755
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,360
buildings that they had that they would

756
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,279
go to work over the time it was

757
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,140
discovered there were like three or four

758
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,600
different offices and here you have a

759
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,039
conversation by somebody who's texting

760
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,600
in going hey can somebody open the door

761
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,520
hit the door hard

762
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,580
just be careful it's painted don't get

763
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,799
dirty that's the conversation now

764
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,179
granted that's been translated from

765
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:26,520
Russian but you know trying to get into

766
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,620
the office and you know experience you

767
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,600
know we go up and we badge in and we our

768
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,340
badge doesn't work well they were trying

769
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,480
to open the door and they just have to

770
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,799
bang it hard

771
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,720
um the other one is uh like talking to

772
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,140
your mom she's a big romantic uh big

773
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,120
smiley face in general we were impressed

774
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,740
by the meeting so you know everyday

775
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,539
conversations that we would see even in

776
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,520
our own work environment are certainly

777
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,919
happening uh within the the group as

778
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:50,880
well

779
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,159
here we have another conversation

780
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:54,000
um

781
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,380
since you didn't know about the band

782
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,740
they didn't issue a fine next time I

783
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,600
will issue okay but it's not a hospital

784
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,700
so here we have them targeting

785
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,320
particular hospitals and I remember in

786
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,419
Coven I think folks may remember as well

787
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,279
you had certain cyber criminal groups

788
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,380
that were saying okay we're not going

789
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,520
after the healthcare organizations

790
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,900
because they're making the working on

791
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,460
the vaccine for us so that we don't get

792
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,480
sick

793
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,919
but then you still had other cyber

794
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:18,179
criminal groups that didn't care because

795
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:20,880
they they enjoyed that was their sector

796
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,320
that they went after they went after the

797
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,419
health care and

798
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,460
um this one within this conversation

799
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,539
we're seeing that well they're not

800
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,640
really resuscitation it's a sports

801
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,460
hospital so it's not you know working on

802
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,320
the vaccine kind of thing

803
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,260
um but we studied them you know when

804
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,840
they go through and they end up figuring

805
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,240
out which group that they've got in so

806
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,159
if they find out an organization that

807
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,020
they've gained access into they have a

808
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,460
whole other department that does all the

809
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,279
oceans the open source intelligence form

810
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,620
and basically what they're doing is

811
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,320
looking at that organization looking at

812
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,960
who works there they're looking at what

813
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,820
their profit loss is or looking you know

814
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,039
looking up information on Google using

815
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,840
all the open uh information that's

816
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,000
available online and figuring out about

817
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,500
as much information about the

818
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,120
organization so they know how much they

819
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,500
can charge them when they hit them with

820
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,940
the ransomware

821
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,760
down in Broward county in Florida

822
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,679
uh I I don't think it was Conti but

823
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:17,940
there was another ransomware group that

824
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,220
hit him up and wanted to charge them I

825
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,679
think it was four million dollars and

826
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,779
this was a school system and they had

827
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:26,340
seen that the budget for the school was

828
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,159
about 400 million and so I'm sorry it

829
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:31,140
was 40 million because it was 10 percent

830
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,760
they were hitting them up for 40 million

831
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,200
so when they bring in the lawyers and

832
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,360
the third party organizations they're

833
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,760
negotiating with the Cyber with the

834
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,899
Cyber criminal group and they're saying

835
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:42,120
look we can't pay you 40 million dollars

836
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,919
we don't have it and they came back and

837
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,539
said look here's all your information we

838
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:47,640
have about you we know you have a 400

839
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,740
million dollar budget that you work from

840
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,940
every year

841
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,980
you can pay us the 40 million they ended

842
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,480
up negotiating it down believe it or not

843
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,159
down to about four hundred thousand

844
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,000
dollars

845
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,760
because they had to show and work they

846
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,039
had their lawyers they had uh some other

847
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,299
Security Professionals in there

848
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,399
negotiating with the the Cyber criminal

849
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,140
group again they're just wanting to get

850
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,120
paid but they were able to negotiate

851
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,679
because pretty well yeah they may have a

852
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:13,020
400 000 budget but they don't have a

853
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,640
surplus they're not a profit making

854
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,340
organizations so granted while the Cyber

855
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,919
criminal group knew it was a school they

856
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,020
they were hoping to you know get as much

857
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,820
as they could out of them

858
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,860
now with regards to Conti one of the fun

859
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,360
one of my favorite quotes that came out

860
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,940
was our good friend Brian Krebs

861
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,480
um Conti is a highly effective if also

862
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,600
remarkably ineffect inefficient cyber

863
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,899
criminal organization so you've got this

864
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:41,700
organization that is sophisticated

865
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,200
they're getting in they're encrypting

866
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,299
data they're making all this money but

867
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:48,659
their back office wasn't as good

868
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:50,940
they had systems that were expiring

869
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,679
hello we're out of Bitcoins four new

870
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:54,899
servers three VPN subscriptions and 22

871
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:57,000
renewals are out please send some

872
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,740
Bitcoins to this wallet you have that

873
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,600
coming from Carter they didn't have a

874
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,100
lot of workflow management you know they

875
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,480
had all these systems that were standing

876
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,220
up they were probably spending a lot

877
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,659
more money than they needed to because

878
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:08,520
they weren't really aware that they were

879
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,620
past due on some of the servers on the

880
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,200
domain registrations uh because a lot of

881
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,419
the time they would create fake domains

882
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:17,460
for the fishing campaigns for the

883
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,559
different organizations and so what

884
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,419
we're seeing here is

885
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:23,700
and there's it was the uh the other one

886
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,679
that's on there as well the another

887
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,500
server you left up it effed me up you

888
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,240
know 100 fine

889
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,460
within the within the kanji group you

890
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,659
would be fined if you did something

891
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,700
wrong you know we do something wrong in

892
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,260
our organization okay our manager might

893
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,120
pull us in give us a talking to and send

894
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,559
us on don't do it again you might get

895
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,640
something written in your permanent

896
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,020
record

897
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,820
they were finding their employees

898
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,919
imagine what if we find our employees

899
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:48,539
you know how much more productivity

900
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,220
might happen but

901
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,899
they're going through and finding the

902
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:53,100
employees this one was a hundred dollar

903
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,440
fine for that and those fines would all

904
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,960
get put into for bonuses

905
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,700
which is what we see here them talking

906
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,620
about the

907
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,279
um

908
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,140
you know this month three people were

909
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,480
fined for absenteeism and various

910
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,820
mistakes that led to losses these fines

911
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,679
will go to the bonus fund for employees

912
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,299
at the end of the month so the employees

913
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:14,460
that are doing the work right the the 60

914
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,720
to 100 people they're doing the work

915
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,580
right they're going to get the bonus

916
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,140
whereas you've got other people that are

917
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,580
slacking off they're not coming into

918
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,740
work you know kind of like the same

919
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,120
problems that we have in our

920
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,159
environments here I know working at the

921
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,260
call center uh my last year that I

922
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,460
worked there I worked my way up to

923
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,779
management I think because I was the

924
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:31,860
only one that was still around after

925
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,299
three years

926
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:36,059
and I just remember the hiring and

927
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,559
firing process of that you would have

928
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:38,940
people that just didn't care it was a

929
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,419
job it wasn't a career for them and so

930
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,820
they essentially were you know didn't

931
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,260
want to come into work but they would be

932
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:50,220
uh fined on a regular basis so

933
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,279
we see that morale is off within these

934
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,380
organizations we've got people that that

935
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,760
you know like to work you got people

936
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,779
that don't like to work you know

937
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,340
Saturday will be a day off same as

938
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,980
Sunday woohoo hooray you know we and

939
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,179
then they've got you know all the

940
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:05,580
exclamation marks

941
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,159
the the interesting thing that came out

942
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,440
of Bentley Bentley's one of the coders

943
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,760
that's in this group and he said our

944
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,620
work is you know generally not difficult

945
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,500
but it's monotonous so it's very tedious

946
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,820
so doing the same thing over and over

947
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,580
and over every day and that certainly

948
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,080
gets to be

949
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,179
um draining on them

950
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:25,980
as you know they're making all this

951
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,559
money but the work is tedious it takes a

952
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,039
lot out of them and uh certainly get a

953
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,840
level of frustration that comes from

954
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,539
them from everybody that's in there

955
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:40,019
with regards to Bentley you know he was

956
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,399
always the one that was making sure that

957
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:42,960
the code was up to date making sure that

958
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,159
they were using the latest malware

959
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,260
making sure they were evading the

960
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,940
systems because one of the things when

961
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,559
you when you first get into one of these

962
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,840
environments one of the and I realized

963
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,399
this when I was doing my own experiment

964
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:54,720
with ransomware

965
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,419
especially on the older malware samples

966
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,100
they automatically get detected by

967
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,899
Microsoft Defender did on my Windows

968
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:03,240
machine and it basically quarantined all

969
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,100
my ransomware samples so then I had to

970
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,960
go back out and re-download them so then

971
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,580
before I realized I wanted to launch the

972
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,159
ransomware I had to figure out okay how

973
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,260
do I disable the antivirus so then I

974
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,879
went out and Googled disabled Microsoft

975
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,639
Defender code and I found a Powershell

976
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,859
script that I was able to run and it

977
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:22,020
disabled it and even on a reboot it

978
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,940
disabled it again so

979
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,159
that's what they were doing and you know

980
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,139
having to constantly evolve and keep up

981
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:31,379
with uh between the you know the the

982
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,060
technology that was going on and be able

983
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,119
to keep their systems running

984
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:39,239
so basically you know Conti in here you

985
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,520
know 2.7 billion dollars is what they

986
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,580
accrued over the uh 2017. the biggest

987
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,859
one they got the biggest Heist that they

988
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:48,480
got was 180 million dollars from one

989
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,879
particular organization they had about

990
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,820
60 to 100 employees working there uh

991
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,379
they were paid anywhere between a

992
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:57,300
thousand to two thousand in Bitcoin

993
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,580
deposits a month

994
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,820
so but over in Russia a thousand two

995
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,140
thousand dollars is probably a lot of

996
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,700
money because the folks that were

997
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,200
working there were working making more

998
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,420
money uh as workers than they would

999
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,920
working anywhere else

1000
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,900
I have to imagine the the upper folks

1001
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,300
Bentley Stern mango and all them they

1002
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,520
were bringing in the millions

1003
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,200
um but they were had a tight

1004
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,900
collaboration with the imitet folks they

1005
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,540
were using their uh criminal platforms

1006
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,220
as well they were constantly having to

1007
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,780
maintain and update their infrastructure

1008
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,880
and they were using a lot of commercial

1009
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,260
tools and I'm going to go into those

1010
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,000
here in just a minute but they were

1011
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,500
using services and a variety of

1012
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,240
different tools throughout

1013
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,359
um the whole time they were running now

1014
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,400
with all of this cyber crime one of the

1015
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,220
things that's always kind of uh

1016
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,560
perplexed me is the fact that why hasn't

1017
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,240
Superman helped us fight any of this

1018
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,980
cyber crime

1019
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,320
because he's afraid of crypto currency

1020
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,540
I warned you

1021
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,400
okay so let's talk about tactics

1022
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,500
techniques and procedures

1023
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,140
let's see where is it here it is so I

1024
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,520
have one of these cool little SanDisk

1025
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,800
one terabyte hard drives and on this is

1026
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,320
about 50 gigs worth of all the Conti

1027
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,280
data

1028
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,680
when I got my hands on the Conti data I

1029
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,119
got my the first thing I got my hands on

1030
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,640
last year was their playbook it was

1031
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,760
posted on the dark web I

1032
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,619
came across it and downloaded it

1033
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:23,880
and I'm going to show you some of the

1034
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,040
pages from that but when they had the

1035
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,960
massive once you had all the files come

1036
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,240
out with debris with their breach along

1037
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,460
with the chats there was also this

1038
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,440
directory that had a whole bunch of you

1039
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,380
had cracked 2019 crack in Russian the

1040
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,500
adminasplate for U.S in English

1041
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,579
Metasploit and Russian you had Network

1042
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,940
pen testing Cobalt strike uh Windows red

1043
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,700
teaming wmi attacks attacking SQL

1044
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,579
servers going after active directory and

1045
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,500
then there was a arrange program

1046
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,780
this these were training videos that

1047
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,579
were on their servers that were from the

1048
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,500
pen testing Academy you can actually go

1049
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,480
out and see them the interesting thing

1050
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,099
that they'd done here was

1051
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:04,500
they had overdubbed it in Russian so

1052
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,320
they're bringing in people that have I

1053
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,839
have to imagine a limited commute amount

1054
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,640
of computer experience they may be just

1055
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,320
everyday folks that know how to use a

1056
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,940
computer and they're bringing them in

1057
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,260
and they're training them these are

1058
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,800
those entry level uh cyber criminals

1059
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,500
essentially uh that they are

1060
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,680
um targeting one of the they've even got

1061
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,240
a whole thing on Cobalt strike how to

1062
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,440
use Cobalt strike they have that

1063
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,300
training video that's in there

1064
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,980
um interesting thing about Cobalt strike

1065
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,400
it's not cheap and they invested through

1066
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,079
the chats it was discovered that Conti

1067
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:40,380
invested about sixty thousand dollars in

1068
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,119
Cobalt strike which when they're

1069
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:44,280
bringing in 108 100 million on average

1070
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,020
with these organizations it's a drop in

1071
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,920
the bucket

1072
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,339
but the licenses they got uh they ended

1073
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:52,740
up spending 30 000 on the licenses they

1074
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,540
gave another thirty thousand to the

1075
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,760
organization to front them to get the

1076
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,040
licenses so they're using the same tools

1077
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,320
that pen testers are using uh and going

1078
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,480
through and then when they're bringing

1079
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,099
in their new recruits they're getting

1080
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:06,119
they're putting them in front of the

1081
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,740
training videos and watching hours and

1082
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,359
hours and hours of training videos from

1083
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,820
the pen testing Academy

1084
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,220
now when we look at how they did their

1085
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,920
attacks you know we can always look at

1086
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,320
the Lockheed Martin cyber kill chain you

1087
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,000
know and they do the reconnaissance so

1088
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,040
they go through and do their initial

1089
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,140
investigations they're going through and

1090
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,240
looking at you know how are they getting

1091
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,980
in the number one way and like you know

1092
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,720
even from our own experience social

1093
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,339
engineering is kind of the common way

1094
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:34,380
that they get in or they're going into

1095
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,320
remote desktop because of covid you had

1096
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,119
so and I think a lot of us are going to

1097
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,680
probably be able to relate when covet

1098
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,820
hit and everybody had to start working

1099
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,800
from home we needed to be able to access

1100
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,420
the system so they put a whole lot of

1101
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,640
RDP on the internet

1102
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,320
uh one of the other fun things I like

1103
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,820
doing with my students is showing them

1104
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,700
show Dan and we do uh when we talk about

1105
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,500
ocean and I bring up Showdown every

1106
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,460
semester and we do a search for TCP 3389

1107
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,099
RDP the remote desktop protocol and it's

1108
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:03,599
always interesting to see how many

1109
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,359
connections there are online last check

1110
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:09,960
there was about 4.6 million RDP sessions

1111
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,240
connected uh on the internet

1112
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,160
one and a half of those belonged here in

1113
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,260
the U.S and of those a bunch of them are

1114
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,780
Google sorry Amazon

1115
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,420
and so they they love going so right out

1116
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,560
of the gate you've got a million and a

1117
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,180
half servers four and a half globally

1118
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,880
that cyber criminals can go after uh

1119
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,320
password guessing they're doing you know

1120
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,599
password credential stuffing or they're

1121
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:33,720
exploiting uh systems overall once they

1122
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,160
get in now they've turned it over to

1123
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,020
their next level of text they're looking

1124
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,640
at maintaining persistence they're using

1125
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,339
other tools to keep that access and be

1126
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:42,480
able to go back in and then start

1127
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,119
looking at exfiltrating the data once

1128
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,380
and usually they're in there for about

1129
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,760
80 Days

1130
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,619
afterward they run their ransomware

1131
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:51,900
their exploit and then hit them with the

1132
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,599
note and wait for payment

1133
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:56,820
now this is out of the hackers quick

1134
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,220
start guide that they had in part of

1135
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,320
their documentation and the Highlight

1136
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,180
that I'm showing here yeah good it says

1137
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,619
I.T professionals with no such

1138
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:05,820
experience

1139
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,500
so they're pretty well got folks that

1140
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,420
you know aren't familiar with using it

1141
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,119
almost any network can be hacked

1142
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,260
and if there are no known

1143
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,760
vulnerabilities in the entry points

1144
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,260
found then you got to look for other

1145
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,280
ways so you're going through social

1146
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,500
engineering but they would always be

1147
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,820
trying the vulnerabilities first that

1148
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,520
was their first part so once they get

1149
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,140
access they're looking at initial access

1150
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,200
with phishing you know compromised o365

1151
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,780
accounts we have the comb that has also

1152
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,400
been discovered at this time your uh

1153
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,800
your collection of massive breaches

1154
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,220
where it's 8 billion passwords over four

1155
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,020
billion usernames accounts passwords

1156
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,839
driver's license and so forth they're

1157
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:44,460
using those to try and gain access which

1158
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,980
is what happened with the colonial

1159
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,720
ransomware attack last year as well as

1160
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,000
the city of Oldsmar those were done with

1161
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,160
credential stuffing they might be doing

1162
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,740
fishing the voicemail phishing um or

1163
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,900
they're using software

1164
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,420
um to get promotion through SEO and then

1165
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,180
looking at other common vulnerabilities

1166
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,040
when they go through and execute they're

1167
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,839
basically looking for domain admins

1168
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,579
they're looking for the active directory

1169
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:10,859
systems they're disabling Windows

1170
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:13,140
Defender and any other EDR software they

1171
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,420
can get they'll even use Kerberos so

1172
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,680
that's targeting the Kerberos

1173
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,579
authentication system uh bypassing that

1174
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:21,900
using other you know living off the land

1175
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,480
they're using other proper services and

1176
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,040
applications that are out there system

1177
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,680
journals mini cats but the the three

1178
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,599
exploits listed here you've got the SMB

1179
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:32,880
print Nightmare and xero logon those

1180
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,280
were their favorite exploits to go after

1181
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,079
when they were getting in organizations

1182
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:40,020
to take advantage of

1183
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,700
because a lot of times folks hadn't had

1184
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,680
those patched yet so here's one of the

1185
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,180
pages out of the Conte Playbook and the

1186
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,560
first thing up at the top is talking

1187
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,020
about doing that research then doing a

1188
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,000
dump of the shares what kind of what

1189
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,740
once they're in on that one system what

1190
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,680
are they connected to going from there

1191
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,660
and then further pursuing Kerberos

1192
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,339
attacks getting to the ad running

1193
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:01,260
getting the password hashes doing

1194
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,880
mimikats

1195
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,460
um and then just it's literally step by

1196
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,260
step of what they need to do to gain

1197
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,240
access into the environment then they're

1198
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,160
looking at destroying the backups

1199
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,859
because we always said from the FBI all

1200
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:15,540
the way to every other cyber security

1201
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,220
professional make sure you got backups

1202
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,900
make sure you test them well then they

1203
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,040
were going through and looking for those

1204
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,320
backups and and essentially deleting

1205
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,180
them and getting rid of them uh and that

1206
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,040
would all happen just before the

1207
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,099
encryption part would happen

1208
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:31,740
so other tools uh Cobalt strike was the

1209
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,900
big one they even had their own scripts

1210
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,060
that they had written uh you had active

1211
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,640
directory find ad find Power view router

1212
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,140
scan looking for routers and trying to

1213
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,240
log in on there use they've got their

1214
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,240
own SQL injection tools ngrok is a

1215
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,760
reverse proxy for remote desktop

1216
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,160
connections any desk which is a remote

1217
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,200
control software of course they're using

1218
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,320
Tor and they're using Metasploit they

1219
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,359
even wrote their own Metasploit scripts

1220
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,380
as well uh the Alias RC basically

1221
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,060
allowed them to generate other

1222
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,700
exploitation tools to run all at once so

1223
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,920
they had the sophistication of the tools

1224
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,260
and the technology as well as using

1225
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,060
Cobalt strike

1226
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,520
it got to the point where they were

1227
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,740
generating all kinds of money that you

1228
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,200
had the developers they wanted to train

1229
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,300
their own Forum environment they wanted

1230
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,700
to create in their own Dark Net maybe

1231
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,440
even consider doing their own crypto

1232
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,180
overall and so with all the money

1233
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,920
they've been making that was kind of

1234
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,480
their where their next step where they

1235
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,160
had planned on going

1236
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,220
uh but by

1237
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,400
early 20 once the uh they came out in

1238
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,680
2022 uh and with some of the other

1239
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,660
attacks they ended up um having to put

1240
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,700
all that uh to the side

1241
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,319
but with all these you know they're

1242
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,520
doing all these attacks and you've got

1243
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,079
all these against

1244
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:50,579
um the websites you know trying to

1245
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:51,599
create their own form and everything

1246
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,280
else in the website

1247
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,560
um I I'm just I've always wondered does

1248
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,300
anybody know where you take a web page

1249
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,579
when it's sick

1250
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:02,599
the urologist

1251
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,599
I heard one clap that's good that was

1252
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:07,319
good

1253
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:09,180
they clapped and went uh no no that

1254
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,859
wasn't funny no no

1255
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:13,079
okay so I got about 10 minutes left

1256
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:14,579
let's talk about some of the defensive

1257
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:16,260
techniques and some of the other things

1258
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,280
going on

1259
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,280
so towards the uh this well it was this

1260
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,619
year in April you have Conti you know

1261
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:24,599
they've come out in

1262
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,640
um they come out in February and say hey

1263
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,140
we're you know we're against the West

1264
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,900
we're you know don't we're kind of

1265
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,060
allying with Russia or not but in April

1266
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,280
they target the con the Costa Rican

1267
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,260
government 30 different systems 30

1268
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,760
different institutions they targeted

1269
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,740
they got access into their systems their

1270
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,380
web pages their social media uh they

1271
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,880
ended up having to pretty well shut down

1272
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,319
all their computer systems in the

1273
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,720
government

1274
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,400
and uh they even had a change in

1275
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,520
presidents and he comes out after uh a

1276
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,900
month of dealing with this and trying to

1277
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,420
recover and basically declares war on

1278
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,980
Conti

1279
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,380
fast forward another month and the Biden

1280
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,180
Administration comes out and offers 10

1281
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,040
million dollars for information leading

1282
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,040
to these to people that are involved

1283
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,319
with Conti with the different groups

1284
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,359
um key positions with Conte hey we want

1285
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:14,220
you to you know five million dollars for

1286
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,359
those

1287
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,400
so and what we've seen in the past with

1288
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,560
other cyber criminal groups is they

1289
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,240
disbanded and that's what ended up

1290
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,760
happening to Conti in May of this year

1291
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,980
but it's kind of interesting because now

1292
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,420
you've got all these people that have

1293
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,460
worked underneath Stern and mango and

1294
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,200
and Bentley and now they're all working

1295
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,599
at all these other cyber criminal groups

1296
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,240
like avos Locker Hive black cat so it's

1297
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,740
taking that knowledge and expanding it

1298
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,619
and passing it on so while Conti the

1299
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:42,720
name itself is gone because now the

1300
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,460
kanji doesn't exist you can't go after

1301
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,079
Conti people because they're not with

1302
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,420
Conti they're with these other groups

1303
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,440
um and then you get all these other

1304
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,980
groups that are uh growing as well and

1305
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,240
essentially we're dealing with a crime

1306
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,599
of extortion and it's the how is

1307
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,280
secondary how they're doing it it's the

1308
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,300
fact that they want to continue to

1309
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,980
evolve and grow

1310
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,200
because essentially I already said it is

1311
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,760
the fact that they do this for one thing

1312
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,040
and one thing only that's to make money

1313
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,960
granted it's Bitcoin a lot of the time

1314
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,000
but they're going through making money

1315
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,579
but when we look at kind of a psychology

1316
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:15,660
of them

1317
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,700
while they're targeting the West for

1318
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,980
them they feel like they're doing right

1319
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,619
I don't condone it but they're they've

1320
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:23,640
got they've got a business they're

1321
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,280
running they are you know the the intent

1322
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,140
that they have is hey if those

1323
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,000
organizations in the west aren't

1324
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,500
securing their networks and we can get

1325
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,119
in well that's on them that's not us

1326
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,160
also their charitable giving hey we're

1327
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,420
taking the money that we're stealing

1328
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,980
from them and we're giving it to people

1329
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,420
that need it

1330
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,380
um and we look at the distance

1331
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,660
innovation

1332
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,119
factor it's their war against the West

1333
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,440
they're targeting it they feel like

1334
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,619
they're unadjusted cause

1335
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:51,780
now there was an interview on VX

1336
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,859
underground I don't know if anybody's

1337
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:54,420
ever seen their site but they've got

1338
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,880
lots of malware samples and uh cool

1339
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,319
stuff but they had an interview with an

1340
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,300
actual ransomware operator they verified

1341
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,460
it was who they were but they disguised

1342
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,359
the name

1343
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:06,000
but this was out of that interview this

1344
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,920
was kind of a breakdown of their profile

1345
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,319
their assist admin hi Nick

1346
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,540
um they're uh they were arrogant to

1347
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,160
being captured they weren't worried

1348
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,140
about the FBI capturing them they were

1349
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,700
more worried about Mandy and finding

1350
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,800
them so it goes a lot to say about

1351
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,720
mandian they were a pen tester they were

1352
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,339
consultant they negotiated they were one

1353
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:25,740
of the negotiators on the other end

1354
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,079
um what cracked me up and it was at the

1355
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,940
end of the interview throughout the

1356
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:30,900
whole interview they're saying how much

1357
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,640
they hate America they hate Americans

1358
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,619
we're arrogant and everything else but

1359
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,839
at the end the interviewer goes is there

1360
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:38,400
anything you'd wish for wish that your

1361
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,260
how your life had been and they go I

1362
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,760
wish I was born in America because I

1363
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,960
probably would be working at a company

1364
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,579
like Google right now

1365
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:46,800
and I I just it just blew me away but

1366
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,960
that again it goes to that mentality of

1367
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,339
of how they were and what they were

1368
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:51,240
doing

1369
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,160
uh over there but you can find that on

1370
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,619
vx-underground.org

1371
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:57,660
so we actually got some advice from

1372
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,119
conti and this was uh through some of

1373
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:02,280
the conversations uh with regards to one

1374
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,319
of the attacks restrict access to

1375
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,420
servers for regular users because they

1376
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,800
were basically getting in on one person

1377
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,480
system and then working their way over

1378
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,180
to an actual server that like an active

1379
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,440
domain controller or something else

1380
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,780
whether you're able to gain access they

1381
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,400
talk about use different passwords

1382
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,720
because a lot of the times they may have

1383
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,339
been using a shared password or a common

1384
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:23,099
password in which case once they figured

1385
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:24,420
out the one they were able to use it for

1386
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,000
all the others make sure EDR is

1387
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,339
installed on every computer whether you

1388
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,740
know pick your flavor set up more of a

1389
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,240
complex storage system don't make it all

1390
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,400
on one flat Network and protect your

1391
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,859
lsas dump on all your computers that's

1392
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:40,319
coming from Conti you know and from

1393
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,300
cyber Security Professionals we're going

1394
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,380
around and we're talking you know make

1395
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,819
sure you got your backups do this do

1396
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:46,200
that they're coming in they're getting

1397
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,640
specific because they're getting

1398
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,839
specific because this is how they're

1399
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:50,940
getting in every single time

1400
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,579
and of course when we end up they even

1401
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:55,619
talk about checking your admins activity

1402
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:57,480
once a week because they're able to

1403
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,920
create their own admin account or

1404
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,420
they're able to take over one of the

1405
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,740
admin accounts and if you're not

1406
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,660
checking that activity

1407
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,119
um you'd certainly miss something

1408
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:08,099
so in the event that you do get hit with

1409
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:10,140
ransomware you know we always say you

1410
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,940
can restore from a backup decrypt your

1411
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,099
files using a third party which by the

1412
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:16,440
way the when I encrypted my files I got

1413
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,020
my hands on the decrypter just in case I

1414
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,339
really screwed something up but I didn't

1415
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:22,140
thank goodness

1416
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,260
um it took five hours to decrypt the

1417
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,839
encrypted files 10 seconds to a minute

1418
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,060
to encrypt it and over five hours to

1419
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,619
decrypt that 40 gig

1420
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:33,119
um you can do nothing lose all your data

1421
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,319
start all over kind of like what

1422
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,200
happened in the LA School District or

1423
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,540
you negotiate and pay the ransom

1424
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,220
but when we look at the best practices

1425
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,079
we always talk about training users and

1426
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:44,520
they even said it as well train you

1427
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,780
train the people that work there to be

1428
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,420
able to spot those fishing tests

1429
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,800
um and if you need a company to do

1430
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,359
security awareness and training I know a

1431
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,400
really good one

1432
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,460
uh backups talked about that segment the

1433
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,319
network don't have that flat Network

1434
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,240
figure out what your critical assets are

1435
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,460
within your organization isolate those

1436
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,260
protect that with MFA additional

1437
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:08,339
firewalls reduce the access for your

1438
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,660
users you know principal at least

1439
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:10,800
privilege

1440
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,619
remove Internet facing RDP put it behind

1441
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:16,140
a firewall use a VPN but having it

1442
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,339
sitting right directly on the Internet

1443
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:20,460
is just an invite for them to come in

1444
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,980
keep up with patches as we saw you know

1445
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,660
you got Conte you like to use those

1446
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,520
three particular ones and they were they

1447
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,859
were successful for them

1448
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,200
and uh incident response and tabletop

1449
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,540
exercises this is a great way to be able

1450
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,579
to a get everybody on board but get

1451
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:36,660
everybody in the organization that's

1452
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:37,920
going to be involved in that incident

1453
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,160
response whether your PR team your CEO

1454
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,099
um the CSO I.T managers the business

1455
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:45,960
getting them together making sure that

1456
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,579
everybody understands what the plan is

1457
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:50,160
and being able to move forward

1458
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,839
I've had Insurance on here for a while

1459
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,099
I'm thinking I may have to take it off

1460
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:55,020
again because I know insurance is not as

1461
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,460
lucrative as it used to be and it's a

1462
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,380
lot harder but

1463
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,079
um because I remember in 2020 2021 that

1464
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:02,880
was kind of thing go get insurance and

1465
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,619
then they'll pay the ransom and so then

1466
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:06,480
the Cyber criminals said okay let's go

1467
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,160
after the insurance companies and then

1468
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,079
they got a whole list of new people to

1469
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,319
go Target so so as we look at all you

1470
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:14,940
know we deal with these computers on the

1471
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,559
systems and the computers on a daily

1472
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,059
basis

1473
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:19,980
um anybody know what you call a computer

1474
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,500
that sings

1475
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,339
Adele

1476
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,980
got a couple more laughs on that one all

1477
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:31,680
right so some additional resources as I

1478
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,819
wrap up here before we take any

1479
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:36,780
questions so Shameless plug no before

1480
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,760
um we have our ransomware hostage rescue

1481
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,020
manual so in the event you get hit

1482
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,119
hopefully you already have your plan in

1483
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:43,859
place but we do have a hustard rescue

1484
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:45,000
manual kind of take you through the

1485
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
steps but a good book a great book out

1486
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,099
there ransomware uh what do you call it

1487
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:51,900
a protection Playbook written by Roger

1488
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,940
Grimes I work with Roger just to be

1489
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,740
transparent but it's a great book I got

1490
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,079
to Tech edit it uh really great

1491
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,000
information in there but as we look at

1492
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,740
ransomware and we continue you know with

1493
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,420
what we've got in our homes is this

1494
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,160
what's next you know are they going to

1495
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,900
start targeting all the iot devices in

1496
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,839
our home our fridges our stoves the

1497
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,880
cameras we've seen attacks on the

1498
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,980
cameras already but you know this fun

1499
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:17,760
little comic of um you know if you um

1500
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,040
if you don't uh if you don't pay up the

1501
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,180
ransom we're going to leave the heat on

1502
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:24,740
in the middle of the summer

1503
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,180
so I don't know if anybody heard but

1504

the guy behind the scenes paying no

1513
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:50,099
attention to the man behind the curtain

1514
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:51,599
I have more fun producing it anyway

1515
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,579
because I get to work with all these uh

1516

1521
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,720
um she hacks purple

1522
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,660
in the community absec we had a guy last

me blockchain fantastic uh thing on

1525
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,400
blockchain and we've had other folks

1526
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,540
stealing and storytelling security

1527
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:18,059
culture so um that's my Shameless plug

1528
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:19,619
to go check it out like I said new

1529
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:21,900
episode dropped today so I want to thank

1530
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,359
you all for your attention and uh time

1531
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:26,460
this morning and I again appreciate the

1532
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,559
opportunity to come and speak and

1533
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:29,880
um I think do we have time for questions

1534
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,400
yeah okay in the back

1535
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,300
the problem

1536
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,259
basically

1537
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,900
yeah no you bring up you bring up a good

1538
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,940
point and I think if they hadn't

1539
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,740
disbanded and they still may be working

1540
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,839
towards doing it

1541
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:11,520
um you know they're always working on

1542
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,859
things they've still got all their money

1543
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:15,599
um we could see something like that we

1544
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,040
could see some I mean it would be you

1545
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,240
know the sheep and the wolf's clothing

1546
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,880
of you know hey you know we're launching

1547
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,140
the ransomware but we can tell you how

1548
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,760
to you know fix it

1549
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,839
um but they're like I said they're

1550
00:54:24,839 --> 00:54:27,300
constantly evolving their their code as

1551
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,920
well and so they may be the ones making

1552
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,359
it available for having the other

1553
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:32,160
decrypters because we've seen with other

1554
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,720
cyber criminal groups when they've

1555
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,520
attacked them or they've broken up that

1556
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,960
their decryptors have been posted online

1557
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,920
as well but that is certainly uh one

1558
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,200
option that may occur we still may see a

1559
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,720
different kind of dark net form

1560
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,980
um or they come up with their own

1561
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,640
cryptocurrency

1562
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,259
oh

1563
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,960
and that's a possibility as well yeah

1564
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:15,440
yes sir

1565
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,400
happens

1566
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:27,540
yeah they're basically helping you cover

1567
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,200
the costs

1568
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:31,740
right

1569
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,799
um

1570
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:36,420
I'll admit I don't have a strong opinion

1571
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,740
on it

1572
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,079
um I think you know essentially we're

1573
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:41,880
dealing with organizations that you know

1574
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,140
get caught with their pants down so to

1575
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,660
speak and nobody wants that I gave a

1576
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,099
similar talk at Gartner the other day

1577
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:48,540
and I was chatting with folks afterward

1578
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:51,000
and you know on I generally was asking

1579
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,380
what is it that scares you about

1580
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,240
ransomware we know what we need to do

1581
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,400
but is you know it's a fear of getting

1582
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,740
hit even though you've got all this uh

1583
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,480
set up and so you have the insurance to

1584
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,460
protect you just in case it does happen

1585
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:05,220
because we all know anything in security

1586
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,319
is not a hundred percent so you're

1587
00:56:07,319 --> 00:56:09,359
always having that risk that's there so

1588
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:10,800
whether using an escrow or you've got

1589
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,240
insurance or you've got some other way

1590
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,760
to help carry that load

1591
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,980
um yeah I have to imagine that the the

1592
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,839
fear is certainly around you know

1593
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:20,940
getting hit and then not knowing what to

1594
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,520
do well not knowing what to do I think a

1595
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,260
lot of us you know

1596
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,940
those that are in that position that

1597
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,640
they can go through and plan and have

1598
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,680
that Playbook and and be prepared and

1599
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,599
and go through those exercises that

1600
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,400
takes care a lot of that so in the event

1601
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,440
it does happen you know do you have the

1602
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,819
technology that can help spot it and

1603
00:56:38,819 --> 00:56:40,800
stop it you know uh those kind of things

1604
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,099
so

1605
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,839
I wasn't kidding I do have a YouTube

1606
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,700
channel

1607
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:51,960
where I have my dad joke videos so

1608
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,400
cool

1609
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,440
alrighty well it's 11 o'clock on my

1610
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,420
clock I don't know where Nick went I

1611
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,520
don't know if he's coming back up or did

1612
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,960
he just leave me here

1613
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,680
um

1614
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,420
let's see what else anybody know why you

1615
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,240
can't use the word beef stew as a

1616
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,359
password

1617
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,540
it's not stroganoff

1618
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,740
um who are my windows users in here

1619
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,660
handful okay you know what a computer

1620
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:21,300
and an air conditioner both have in

1621
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:22,400
common

1622
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,420
they're both useless when you open

1623
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:27,260
windows

1624
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,400
so here's one here's here's one for that

1625
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,720
uh

1626
