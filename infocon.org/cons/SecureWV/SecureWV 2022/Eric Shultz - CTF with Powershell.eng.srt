1
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,240
okay I think we've uh waited long enough

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,459
I thank everyone for returning

3
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,779
I did blow through the first round of

4
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,480
slides pretty quickly my apologies

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,480
uh and if you missed the opening couple

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,520
of slides I do encourage if you've got a

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,440
laptop please try to follow along I

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,899
think the best way to learn is to try it

9
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,579
yourself

10
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,620
make sure everyone can hear me everyone

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,360
pretty much over there I guess can you

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,760
all hear me unfortunately can you see

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,920
the screen there's not much oh is there

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,899
another screen over there

15
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,300
yeah

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,039
I don't know if there's anything they

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,020
can do so we got two screens I guess at

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,100
least

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,379
as I said please follow along try it

20
00:00:58,379 --> 00:00:59,280
yourself

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,379
the whole point of this session is

22
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,019
working way through some of this Capture

23
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,159
the Flag or I don't know if you want to

24
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,240
call it war games

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,939
that will test your Powershell knowledge

26
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,619
and experience and encourage you to

27
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,979
learn more

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,720
having said that the Powershell is not

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,939
running here or there it's running

30
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,040
somewhere else so all you need is an SSH

31
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,060
client

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,159
as I got up here on the screen

33
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,520
if anyone's ready I like to use putty

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,100
I've also used this thing called MOBA X

35
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,000
term I'm sure dozens more out there so

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,140
pick your favorite

37
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,780
and I do want to know if you have Linux

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,640
or Mac or Unix you can still follow

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,320
along because it's SSH so you're

40
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,299
connecting to the Box you do not need to

41
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,200
have Windows on your box

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,420
all right I'll let it slip right there

43
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,820
if anybody has seen this under the wire

44
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,979
this may not be all that exciting for

45
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:53,700
you

46
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,680
this is simply website out there some

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,420
folks are putting up these puzzles

48
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,939
they're available for free

49
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,439
I have nothing to do with it I'm not

50
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,380
getting any Kickbacks I swear I'm uh I'm

51
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,640
you know running into folks who are

52
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,200
writing software that I've mentioned but

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,020
I have no idea who's behind this

54
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,879
founded a few years ago found it was

55
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,440
kind of fun if you want to learn more

56
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,540
about Powershell here's some puzzles to

57
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,739
get you to work at it

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,959
that's a snapshot of the web page to get

59
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,280
you started

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,080
you see across the top after the home

61
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,879
there is the war games that's the page

62
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,040
you're going to want

63
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,140
so today I'll give you a few moments to

64
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,819
help you get set up if you're setting up

65
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,160
and then we'll start talking about these

66
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,739
puzzles and uh coming to answers for

67
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:40,560
them I don't know how quickly we'll get

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,640
through this I'm not trying to get

69
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,739
through it quickly though the idea is to

70
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,720
do some research if anybody's actually

71
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,580
trying yourself

72
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,220
and I do have some hints I guess these

73
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,440
slides I am used to being environments

74
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,879
where we often provided the slides

75
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,220
beforehand so uh I guess that's not

76
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,260
happening here but if you get a copy of

77
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,519
the slides I've got some hints at the

78
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,239
back

79
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,580
you seem to be stuck I can actually

80
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,260
bring him up on the screen here I tried

81
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,180
to make them subtle you might have

82
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,819
noticed those light gray slides toward

83
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,140
the back there

84
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,360
just in case we hit those by accident I

85
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,860
didn't want to give away the surprise

86
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,220
ending

87
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,879
we've got some screenshots here of putty

88
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,800
the configuration if anybody's not

89
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,239
familiar we can talk about that if

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,459
anybody needs help

91
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,860
if you didn't know and putty there I can

92
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,560
provide the name or the IP for the host

93
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,239
and that's what you're looking for

94
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:34,440
century

95
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,420
dot Under The Wire

96
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,940
dot Tech

97
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,859
standard Port 22 for SSH

98
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,840
the bottom screen is more configuration

99
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,180
I like to log things whenever I'm doing

100
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,659
SSH so there's a way I can probably

101
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,400
bring up a larger image if you want to

102
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,680
see it just shout out give me a hands up

103
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,360
or whatever if you want to see it but

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,580
that's a way you can set up a log file

105
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,860
you can give it a date and time and the

106
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,040
name of the server so you can have

107
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,599
a number of log files and you can

108
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,280
remember which ones they were what dates

109
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,780
and what box you were

110
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,920
sshing into

111
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,899
uh hostname

112
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,120
there there are a few different hosts

113
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,160
names we are going to focus on Century I

114
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,800
was gonna I was gonna say right here

115
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,900
the war game page you see there there's

116
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,620
a century cyborg Groot Oracle Trebek and

117
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,720
then there's one offline currently I was

118
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,979
going to start us with Century I think

119
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:35,639
that's supposed to be the most

120
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,639
straightforward I think it's 15 levels

121
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,280
so if you want to see the web page go to

122
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,280
www.underthewire.tech

123
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,520
if you want SSH it was Century dot under

124
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,680
the wire dot Tech

125
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,460
I remember right

126
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,840
when you go to the website

127
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,120
it gives you some hints

128
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,240
the answer is always lowercase and the

129
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,699
answer is always

130
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,340
take the one or more parts of it and

131
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,280
just put them all together lowercase

132
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,800
include any dots that are in in the

133
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,180
answer in the part of the answer you'll

134
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,860
see that in a moment I'll include any

135
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,259
dashes you know but but no spacing no

136
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:23,699
extra character so you do not add

137
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,940
anything

138
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:32,780
so the goal of the first level is log in

139
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,880
you would go to their slack Channel I'm

140
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,259
not going to expect people to do that

141
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,759
even if you got slack it might take a

142
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,860
few moments so here's the clue if you

143
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,960
want to play any of these games

144
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,820
the first level

145
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,220
is the name of the box

146
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,880
with one and the password is the name of

147
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,320
the box with the number one it's a

148
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,220
sentry

149
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,500
your username is Century one

150
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,720
your password is Century one

151
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,820
you will want to log in because you'll

152
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,400
need to be on Century one as user Sentry

153
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,180
one

154
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,580
to get the answers to these puzzles and

155
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,800
move on to the next level

156
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,320
so any of you following along go ahead

157
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,520
I'll give you a few moments

158
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,520
you know those are high

159
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,940
yeah

160
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,759
if you're not familiar you're looking at

161
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,919
putty right now here's my

162
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,539
configuration which I showed just a

163
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,500
moment ago

164
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,780
[Music]

165
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,759
if you got it wrong you'll know pretty

166
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,220
much instantly yeah there we go okay

167
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,300
did I spell it wrong

168
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:00,840
if you got it right

169
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,799
you now have a prompt

170
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,960
you'll notice your user right there in

171
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,759
the

172
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,620
prompts level itself it says users

173
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,280
Sentry one

174
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,960
all right question in the back

175
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,660
uh the it actually has

176
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,240
check if you just type in the name

177
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,800
Sentry dot under the wire dot Tech

178
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,539
DNS usually Saves the Day

179
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,360
can you not give it a name you have to

180
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,840
have the IP

181
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,099
because I can probably get it for you if

182
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,159
you

183
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,419
[Music]

184
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,520
all right so yes if you've all are not

185
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,259
familiar with Powershell you'll have to

186
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:02,940
take a few moments but

187
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,699
if you want to get to level two it wants

188
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,720
the build version

189
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,639
not the Powershell version

190
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,039
now there is no

191
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:15,660
there's no quick hint I could give you

192
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,800
on this one

193
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,699
uh the web is your friend Google start

194
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,740
page

195
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,039
I think Brave has a page star page is a

196
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,500
trying to be one of those um private

197
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,879
search engines have you not heard of

198
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,000
that one don't track you in particular

199
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,919
uh being Yahoo whichever your favorite

200
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,539
one is

201
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,099
just might have to go out there and type

202
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:39,179
in

203
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,700
build version for Powershell

204
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,799
there are probably a few different ways

205
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,760
of getting there

206
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,560
well and I didn't have the link here I

207
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,820
found one good page from a website Petri

208
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,899
petri.com I think is a decent site

209
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,220
they've got a number of good articles

210
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,140
again I have no connection I don't know

211
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,880
this person or these people

212
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,080
but you'll probably find there are

213
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,580
various sites you go to again again and

214
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,660
Petri is one of the ones

215
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,519
but there is this thing called PS

216
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,120
version table

217
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,480
if anybody wants to take a moment

218
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,440
and look it up

219
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,399
once again showing off that tab complete

220
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,500
I'm going to keep reminding you all of

221
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,820
that I don't know if people use that a

222
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,580
lot I find it invaluable

223
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,500
um Windows world and in other places as

224
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,180
well

225
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,500
if you think you're on to something

226
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,600
start typing in start pressing tab

227
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,040
if there's a match it'll bring you right

228
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,720
to it if not it'll start cycling you

229
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,800
through possible matches

230
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,560
I see squinting hold on let me see here

231
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,060
yeah you know I try to get it make it

232
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,440
large enough but

233
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,399
um

234
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,800
depends on how big the projection is

235
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,579
what am I looking for

236
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,120
just what am I looking for can I change

237
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,339
there we go

238
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,740
that better

239
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,459
a bit better

240
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,040
so I'm not going to rush anybody try it

241
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,560
yourself do your own searching but

242
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,360
here's a quick way to get to the answer

243
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,700
for this one

244
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,260
and as I mentioned and I think the

245
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,060
mentioned on the web page you don't want

246
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,680
that PS version

247
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,959
you want the build version

248
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,519
so here's another clue you probably want

249
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,019
to open up your favorite notepad and

250
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,760
maybe do some typing

251
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,560
so you don't have to do too much back

252
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,040
and forth

253
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,300
type it in once cut and paste it

254
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,480
and if I remember right that was what

255
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,519
you needed just the build version

256
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,320
let's start a new session

257
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,160
[Music]

258
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,959
I'm going on to level two so the user

259
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,560
would be Sentry two

260
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,240
Century 3 Century 4 on and on

261
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,019
foreign

262
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:15,940
type it in exactly as you see it

263
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,049
[Music]

264
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,360
okay I don't have

265
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,079
big fat fingers

266
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,920
of course once you move on to the next

267
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,360
level you can let the other levels go

268
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,500
you don't need to keep them

269
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,080
[Music]

270
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,380
you're going to see that we start to use

271
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,139
those Powershell commands I described in

272
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,860
the last session

273
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,920
this is a two-part answer

274
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,260
it wants the Powershell equivalent of

275
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,260
wgets I imagine people here know W gets

276
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,300
or curl that was that's a similar

277
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,360
utility different name okay

278
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,579
and it wants the name of the file on the

279
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:28,880
desktop

280
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,519
I mentioned that nice get command

281
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,060
shortened to GCM if you want

282
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,160
oh yeah that should be

283
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,380
there we go

284
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,940
don't worry don't bother scrolling

285
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,320
through that

286
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,980
don't need to

287
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,480
GCM space

288
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,100
wget might be an alias

289
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,440
it's just there on the bottom

290
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,339
type in GCM and wget

291
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,920
and it tells you the actual command the

292
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,480
actual function

293
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,540
invoke web request that's the first part

294
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,019
of your answer

295
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,660
you may use GCM quite a lot

296
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,240
but probably not as much as child item

297
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,620
which is what we're really going to be

298
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,760
using

299
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,560
pretty much every level from here on out

300
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,220
okay so uh invoke web request all lower

301
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,800
case but nothing else don't don't take

302
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,880
anything out don't put anything in

303
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,339
and let's see then the other part that

304
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:36,540
was what the name of the file on the

305
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,779
desktop

306
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,120
okay those of you familiar with the Dos

307
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,339
world no dir those familiar with the

308
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,380
Linux World know LS

309
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,100
take a pick

310
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,100
or

311
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,120
the actual Powershell statement

312
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,019
the child item

313
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,079
don't be confused it's not the length

314
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:08,399
you want it's the name I guess they're

315
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,540
perhaps trying to be a little tricky

316
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,240
there so you have your invoke web

317
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,800
request

318
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,579
443

319
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
.

320
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,860
foreign

321
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:20,220
not to go too fast and Rush people

322
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,019
I see people are looking back up here

323
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,860
we'll continue on

324
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,420
[Music]

325
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,100
count the number of files on the desktop

326
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,500
you could list the entire

327
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,899
screen and manually count them

328
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,920
but I think this is a good time to

329
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,480
mention

330
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,399
some of the internals Powershell likes

331
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,800
to work with things in objects

332
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,540
I think everybody has heard of objects

333
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,040
object-oriented languages an

334
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,899
object-oriented

335
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,839
operating systems uh but Power selected

336
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,600
working objects so objects often have

337
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,139
properties

338
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,359
I have no idea if there's actually 175

339
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:16,380
972 and 996 doesn't matter

340
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,400
what I can do

341
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,679
got to adjust the screen here hold on

342
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,980
smoke

343
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,880
no

344
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,520
okay that's just

345
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,500
I put it in parentheses which basically

346
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,820
lets Powershell know I'm treating like

347
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,020
an object now

348
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,440
I can reference one of its

349
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,880
parameters one of its values

350
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,940
so there are actually

351
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,299
123 things in this folder files I think

352
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:55,559
it's only files

353
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,000
but I believe it would just be the count

354
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
of everything in that current folder so

355
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,840
123.

356
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,760
ah let's try this I shouldn't go off

357
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,600
script

358
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,340
yeah

359
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,039
again tab complete tab completion

360
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,020
whichever way you like it

361
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,220
if you want to know what other things

362
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,740
you could perhaps take a gander at

363
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,860
as we have an object these are various

364
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,700
values that object may be able to track

365
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,179
okay

366
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:37,740
now you notice we've got the opening

367
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,480
parentheses that's it would be

368
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,160
requesting some bit of information some

369
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,840
some kind of value a parameter inside

370
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,220
there

371
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,020
if I were to press enter now I should

372
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,520
just get an error message

373
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,260
no that's right it prompts me for more

374
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,160
information

375
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,740
okay that's a good pause perhaps a

376
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,600
double greater than like that it wants

377
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,740
more information

378
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,240
not hung up or anything like that it's

379
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,919
just waiting it needs a parameter or

380
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,900
maybe more

381
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,580
of course control C and you're out

382
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,879
you're here

383
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,100
is that me that is me is it

384
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,140
I'm not trying to embarrass anybody but

385
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,320
yeah

386
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,160
I wonder if my phone was going off okay

387
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,660
then moving on to the next one this

388
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,100
should be Century four now

389
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,679
enjoy this while it lasts that is your

390
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,220
shortest password

391
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,460
it wants the password is the name

392
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,380
well the file within a directory that

393
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,960
has spaces

394
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,179
spaces used to be the killer for dos and

395
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,220
years ago it's not a problem anymore

396
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,600
you're going to be using get child item

397
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,179
probably should just take a moment and

398
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,660
change my

399
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,720
okay

400
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,400
I'll hit it once again that nice tab

401
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,660
completes

402
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,320
it will help you there's your folder can

403
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,039
you open me

404
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,280
lsdir get child item whichever

405
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,220
press that tab it tries to help you when

406
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,919
it can now it's surrounded the spaces

407
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,299
and there's the file

408
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:38,100
I know a lot of these early ones are

409
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,480
probably pretty boring and dull but

410
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,559
they're just trying to introduce people

411
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,158
to Powershell

412
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,659
see lots of heads are down that's good I

413
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:58,980
think you have that or they're falling

414
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,159
asleep

415
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,780
let me know if I need to explain

416
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,039
anything or slow down

417
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,640
okay it wants to know the short name for

418
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,159
the domain

419
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,900
I'll give you a nice

420
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,659
glue there right on the slide and if you

421
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,640
were here at the previous

422
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,600
presentation

423
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,679
Powershell offers

424
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,059
one one place to go to get a lot of

425
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,260
information about the current

426
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,740
environment

427
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,780
anyone wants to do any searching I'll

428
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,340
take a moment I'll give you guys a

429
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,659
moment

430
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:53,400
if you didn't catch my first

431
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,000
presentation

432
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:05,299
it's represented with EnV environment

433
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,900
profile information app data

434
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,600
where it finds files program files 686

435
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,940
w64

436
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,720
computer name

437
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,320
foreign right down here near the bottom

438
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,700
the user domain

439
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,260
I believe it want to be short version it

440
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,400
said not the longer one

441
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,539
so Under The Wire

442
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:35,159
oh that's right that's tip one that's

443
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,720
part one

444
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,400
part two I forgot my apologies the uh

445
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,200
the name of the file on the desktop

446
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,900
[Music]

447
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,900
again lsdir get child item whichever

448
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,769
[Music]

449
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,400
now I would like to know the number of

450
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,820
folders

451
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,100
it doesn't seem too bad but I'm not

452
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,480
going to count them by hand

453
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,829
[Music]

454
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,520
a few more than last time

455
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,559
now I believe that is the correct answer

456
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:35,418
but here's another one for you

457
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,960
what about subfolders

458
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,380
we can go inside the parentheses so he's

459
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,940
treating it like an object the result is

460
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,140
an object so we can go inside those

461
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,539
parentheses and we can ask it to

462
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,960
spell it right

463
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,500
recursor which means check any

464
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,720
subfolders as well

465
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,600
I think about found out in this case

466
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,559
it is the same

467
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,140
so there is there are nothing below

468
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,020
these folders

469
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,879
so your answer should be 197.

470
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,880
everyone trying at home uh keeping up am

471
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,919
I going too fast I can I can slow down I

472
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,220
can pause

473
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:38,580
I'll get child item directory LS get

474
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,700
child item and then if you use the tab

475
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,559
Complete because is this what you mean

476
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,059
you're getting to level five or you mean

477
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:45,779
getting

478
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:48,299
the next one

479
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:49,740
when you're on level five trying to get

480
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,480
to level six

481
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,720
uh yeah EnV like for example uh dir

482
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,480
space list basically if you want EnV

483
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,020
colon it's a lot like the old dos drives

484
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,200
if you will so dir space EnV with a

485
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,559
colon

486
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,740
it is a little confusing sometimes

487
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,260
like the PS version table that was an

488
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,580
object you just put a dollar sign in

489
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,140
front of it and you can get it that way

490
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,960
but some of these things uh from the

491
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,120
previous presentation EnV is treated

492
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,640
like a drive if you will and same thing

493
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,279
with the hive the the registry

494
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:29,940
you could type in dir space hkcu and

495
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,059
list out your current user registry

496
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:34,860
right there like it was a drive there

497
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,659
like it was Drive C or drive F or

498
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:37,620
whatever

499
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,260
so in this case you want dir space EnV

500
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,740
colon

501
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,080
after the colon if you want I'm sorry I

502
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,679
didn't point that one out

503
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:55,279
what I can do with this one stopped

504
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,840
lots of flexibility so here's the

505
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,700
environment well what you can do again

506
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,679
maybe I point it was not maybe I didn't

507
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,980
say anyway

508
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,320
[Music]

509
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,720
use that tab complete again if you want

510
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,220
you can just get that one thing

511
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,580
or

512
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,600
you can find out what things begin with

513
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,340
user and just start again cycling

514
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,600
through them these are the different

515
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,860
options items objects

516
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,980
to begin with the word user

517
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,200
I should probably let's see is this a

518
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,059
good time to

519
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:39,200
okay maybe with the S

520
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:41,039
one thing to be careful of when using

521
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,480
tab complete

522
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,039
if I give it an s

523
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,840
like you look at just above on the

524
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,679
screen a little bit you see there are a

525
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,539
number of things to begin with letter s

526
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:50,820
we give it the letter s it'll start yep

527
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,678
SSH client working its way down

528
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:56,820
syndrive system backup test is each

529
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,860
client

530
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,659
if

531
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:03,120
I happen to do something like s y

532
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,799
it's going to skip all the sshs because

533
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,360
that doesn't begin sy so you're going to

534
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,880
get system drive system

535
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,380
if you start typing something and you

536
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,640
don't seem to be finding what you're

537
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,080
looking for maybe try backing up a

538
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,919
letter

539
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,419
maybe you went the wrong direction if

540
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:18,080
you spelled it wrong

541
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,440
anyway I do system D I'm only going to

542
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,100
get a system to drive

543
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,419
I thought there was another system there

544
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,740
we go it says my brass is a roof

545
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,100
and he once again

546
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,659
helps you out

547
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:44,399
you need those quotes where you're gonna

548
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,600
have some of these other characters like

549
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,220
parentheses

550
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,679
they're allowed but they may interfere

551
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,659
with some processing so put them in the

552
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,279
quote like that

553
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,960
and you won't have any trouble and it

554
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,620
did that for me

555
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,640
okay

556
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,520
all right I think we were working on

557
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,340
six getting up to seven

558
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,899
if I remember it we got our answer at

559
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:19,699
197 I think 197.

560
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,380
anything else any other questions any

561
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,620
other confusion

562
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,678
hmm

563
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:31,019
the password is the

564
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,539
readme file is in the readme file

565
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,340
somewhere

566
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,100
in the contacts desktops documents

567
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,719
downloads favorites

568
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:44,340
all right we're probably going to use

569
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:48,980
that get child item or LS or dir again

570
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:54,659
and I gave you a clue from blast puzzle

571
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:55,740
foreign

572
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,899
so let's see how easily it works

573
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:06,620
nothing here

574
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,100
all right everyone

575
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,150
[Music]

576
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,379
no because I'm on the desk my bed

577
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:24,599
okay you see what I did there I'm on the

578
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,980
desktop I don't want to be on the

579
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,300
desktop

580
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,859
that's why I didn't find what I was

581
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,159
looking for

582
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,960
there are a bunch of folders and there's

583
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,280
going to be a readme in there somewhere

584
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:41,359
now let's try

585
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,499
[Music]

586
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,960
it all right it goes by pretty quick

587
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,580
let's see if I can scroll this gently

588
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,260
there's my command about Midway on the

589
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,619
screen now

590
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,060
so it gave me the folder we just saw a

591
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,060
moment ago

592
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,980
and in downloads there seems to be a few

593
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,240
files

594
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,799
a readme and a readme too

595
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,960
so here's where we can

596
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,720
use tab complete and uh

597
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,780
so the cat command like the type command

598
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,820
of Dos days

599
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,260
display whatever on the screen display

600
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,359
the contents of that item or all those

601
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:55,859
items you can count lots of files all at

602
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:57,900
once

603
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,359
display them on the screen so yes if

604
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,040
you're not familiar with what I mean I

605
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,420
believe I should have been able to go

606
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,200
like that

607
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,680
of course it doesn't tell me which file

608
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,040
was which where it found that string but

609
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,079
basically open the first file dumped

610
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,820
anything and second file dumped anything

611
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,079
when a third file dumped anything

612
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,700
foreign

613
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:25,339
there we have our next answer I believe

614
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,740
everyone following along

615
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,939
that wants to follow along

616
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,180
thank you

617
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:39,180
oh yeah these start to get more fun

618
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,379
they're a little more complex

619
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,160
how many unique entries within the file

620
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,700
on the desktop okay well

621
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,339
we have pretty much reached the end of

622
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:54,660
my presentation I wasn't sure how fast

623
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,460
we'd get here I apologize if I rush

624
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,140
through it but we still have a few more

625
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,259
minutes

626
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,180
[Music]

627
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,520
so I think it is time for me I did this

628
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,060
once before

629
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,720
I think it's time for me

630
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,160
start doing some research

631
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,460
because I'm not sure how I did this last

632
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,700
time

633
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,060
foreign

634
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,119
this looks very promising I think that's

635
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:14,960
about the way I remember

636
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:20,520
first would be a good example of how you

637
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,079
might script it if you wanted to use

638
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,579
this function again again so it's a

639
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:25,619
little more sophisticated

640
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:27,599
the second one is what you're basically

641
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,480
doing take your data

642
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,820
familiar with the pipe symbol this means

643
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,740
take it and send it to the next thing

644
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,839
as input

645
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:40,020
that would be the sort object

646
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,640
in this case it should be sorting them

647
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,140
numerically

648
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,820
I imagine this default will be from the

649
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,280
lowest the one to the highest

650
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,980
four six four three

651
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,099
and then piping it again

652
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,780
if you're familiar with the Unix world

653
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,520
you know you can keep piping command to

654
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,839
command command all the way down the

655
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,900
line

656
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:10,380
so what do we have we have unique

657
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,040
all right

658
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,560
he's too impatient it was getting there

659
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,859
for me

660
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,280
now that will just give you the list

661
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,420
so once again those who

662
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,000
oops I gotta screw it not just the

663
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,180
temperature

664
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,640
LS told me there was one file on the

665
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,140
desktop that's probably what I want to

666
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,400
work with

667
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,859
cat will take the contents and do

668
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:06,000
something with it in this case I'm

669
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,800
piping it into the sort object

670
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,380
commandlet

671
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,660
taking that output

672
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,300
sending it in to get unique if I had

673
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,099
stopped at the second pipe it would

674
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:20,180
simply put it on the screen for me

675
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:22,500
then I pass it in to get unique which

676
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,500
simply removes any duplicates and still

677
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,119
puts it onto the screen for me

678
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:36,440
so I believe we should still be able to

679
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,540
put it all into the parentheses saying

680
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:43,940
we want to treat this like an object and

681
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,620
[Music]

682
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,140
parentheses around my entire statement I

683
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,420
want the results to be held

684
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,280
as an object in memory that that object

685
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,440
has properties one of them is the number

686
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,800
of

687
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,460
and perhaps now you start to appreciate

688
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,320
scripting and how you can add these

689
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,180
things all together

690
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,980
I I grew up in the Doss world you might

691
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,140
say but soon after I started getting

692
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,579
into Unix and that's one thing I really

693
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,740
did like about the Unix world is lots of

694
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,359
little utilities

695
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:20,280
that did perhaps one thing and did it

696
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,560
very well but you could build lots of

697
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,560
fun tools by sending from A to B to C to

698
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,820
D

699
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,099
and there's something of an example

700
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:30,780
the cat command to the sort object

701
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,160
command to the get unique command

702
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,200
it's good to see that available in the

703
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,060
windows world because boy if you all are

704
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,220
my age you remember command com that was

705
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,859
pretty basic command DXE was not much

706
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:46,098
better

707
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,079
so you learned programming languages you

708
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:50,400
learned how to

709
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,140
use whatever you had at your fingertips

710
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,599
like basic or Pascal or C or something

711
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,640
like that heck even assembly

712
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,540
if you needed to

713
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,180
everybody following along so far

714
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,440
that should be

715
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:10,140
a number of unique entries within the

716
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,700
file on the desktop so that's all we

717
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,939
need

718
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,700
okay well it's 244.

719
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,380
we'll take a look maybe one more level

720
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,579
because I want to give I don't know if

721
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:22,200
anybody has any questions but there will

722
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,880
be another presentation so I don't want

723
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,720
to take up all the time

724
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,740
what are we up to nine

725
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,900
thank you

726
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,160
because I know it's a little confusing

727
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,900
when you look at my slides

728
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,480
I got a screen for say seven I'm saying

729
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,680
getting tape and I thought that was the

730
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,880
best way to word it because that's the

731
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,140
point you're on seven you're trying to

732
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,960
get data to get to level eight but if

733
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,980
you look on the screen that might be a

734
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,500
little confusing

735
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,720
my my prompt is for um

736
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,339
level eight but I'm trying to get to

737
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:08,040
level nine so here I am logging yeah

738
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,880
lose my place

739
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,640
anybody on the website

740
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,299
give me a moment

741
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:24,839
I don't think I got the screenshot for

742
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:27,078
that one

743
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,079
thank you

744
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:50,899
ah okay the 160 first word

745
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,500
all right well first let me ask any

746
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,940
questions anything I need to go back on

747
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,560
would anybody like to see anything over

748
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,200
again yes

749
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,560
yes

750
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:19,500
foreign

751
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,480
so are you talking about like

752
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,560
executables or

753
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,640
commands that are built in well if

754
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,540
you're looking for anything that's

755
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,160
internal that's where you can use

756
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,599
something like get alias or get command

757
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:32,579
will we at my first talk because we

758
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:34,619
talked about that briefly okay if you're

759
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:37,140
looking for executables

760
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,819
I think it would really

761
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,780
I guess the short answer is no the

762
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,060
longer answer is give me a moment

763
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,839
this is

764
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,640
okay

765
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,640
um

766
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,040
are you looking for something in

767
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,119
Powershell or are you looking for

768
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,280
something on the box

769
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,780
he was talking about get help and that

770
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,319
would help you

771
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,500
yeah

772
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,880
about the only thing I can think of

773
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,660
would be

774
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,380
ah sorry well yeah I'm here wait so well

775
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,180
let me go through this is their system

776
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,500
so I don't know how far it'll let me go

777
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,359
okay interesting I don't think I've

778
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:26,579
tried this okay I've gone up to the root

779
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,619
well you know you've got the recursive

780
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,000
ability that's about the closest thing I

781
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,119
think you can come to is I can up here

782
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,040
perhaps look where you said s for split

783
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,660
thank you

784
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,040
so obviously I'd want to control this

785
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,720
paging but here are the things that

786
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,460
begin with S

787
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,260
and it'll show you where they are and

788
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,359
every time red text goes by that's a

789
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,520
folder I can't get into

790
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,180
so s too many things that let's try that

791
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,480
again

792
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,280
yeah so like I said the short answer is

793
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,960
no the long grants would be uh you can

794
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,339
try to find it so

795
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,640
you'll see

796
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:23,220
uh methods that are available on objects

797
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,859
now I think that that's if you're inside

798
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:27,180
of Powershell is what you're talking

799
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,800
about the things impartial but I think

800
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,880
you were looking for things that might

801
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,180
not be

802
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,960
very comfortable

803
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,440
I I would agree with that it does change

804
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,000
it's much more powerful than the old

805
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,760
command exe so yes it was the learning

806
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,700
curve but that's why I was pointing out

807
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,720
um

808
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,180
the things like you know get module as

809
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,720
he mentioned

810
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,520
so I don't know if you saw that but this

811
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,060
will list everything uh sorry um get

812
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,680
command

813
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,900
okay module is exactly that but uh get

814
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,520
command

815
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,040
that is everything that is available to

816
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:17,460
you right now inside a Powershell

817
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,200
so you might want to

818
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:25,619
limit it

819
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:27,839
it's checking and see there's there's

820
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,280
well split path that's not what you're

821
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,480
looking for

822
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,200
um

823
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,180
but you can do things like that if

824
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,560
you're talking about inside of

825
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,579
Powershell things that are available

826
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,380
when you have Powershell if you're

827
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,060
talking about executables outside of it

828
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,560
then yeah I'm not really sure what to

829
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,300
that's going to be different so I wonder

830
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,640
which way your question was going it has

831
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,140
if it helps at least or confused you

832
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,319
more

833
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,619
well again you'll

834
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:01,380
so what I did was

835
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,200
coming in put it into a variable and

836
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,819
then give that variable type get number

837
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:11,940
for a uh yeah get number and then I saw

838
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:16,440
that because it was a stream topic

839
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,420
you know I'd forgot about this since I

840
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,940
haven't done this

841
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,500
this specifically but I'm noticing right

842
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,060
here at the bottom

843
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,500
it's also listing out the applications

844
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,980
for you

845
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,760
and it is giving I forgot that it would

846
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,020
do that I'm used to just giving you

847
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,460
basically the aliases the functions the

848
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,040
commandlets but in this case it is

849
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,079
listing out applications

850
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:40,560
and uh because my font is so large I

851
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,119
it's off the screen but it's showing you

852
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:44,220
where to find it of course you don't

853
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,660
really need to know where to find it you

854
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:48,180
should be able to start typing in these

855
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,520
commands

856
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,359
so

857
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:58,319
it is not as sophisticated

858
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,060
but yeah there you go there's good old

859
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,800
fine string I use that one from time to

860
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,540
time

861
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,099
because of course in Powershell you have

862
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:07,260
VPS or to list processes if you're

863
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,180
looking for specific process you can

864
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,619
like pipe the results through a fine

865
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:13,020
string to look for a part of it there

866
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,400
are other ways but that's just one way

867
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,380
of doing it I mentioned I just like to

868
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,240
know what's out there

869
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,099
the utilities are out there for me

870
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:21,180
already

871
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:24,060
okay well I think I gotta wrap it up

872
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,339
any other last questions any other last

873
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:30,500
comments okay well thanks again everyone

874
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,619
okay so let's see uh as mentioned uh

875
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:36,480
create your own cheat sheets web is

876
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,780
helpful and okay there's me real quick

877
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,940
um I like to consider myself a hacker in

878
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,680
the old sense I'm not one of those

879
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,240
malicious people but I found computers

880
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,500
and I just wanted to learn everything I

881
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,660
could about them they were the new world

882
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,400
to explore I wanted to understand how it

883
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,780
all works

884
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,760
have I been in the gray areas every now

885
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,020
and then yeah I guess I probably have

886
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,700
thank God for cyber security as a

887
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,619
profession so we get to be paid to do

888
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:00,000
that

889
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,740
uh and I admit a little while ago I

890
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,540
realized I must be a curmudgeon been

891
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,160
there done that not too excited anymore

892
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,980
you gotta convince me

893
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,079
I'm willing to listen but you gotta

894
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,079
explain you gotta argue with me

895
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:15,480
and there you go a personal statement I

896
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,740
