1
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,340
it definitely changed and that was

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,679
alluded to in the keynote as well

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:14,820
um so we'll talk about some of those

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,859
Trends as well

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,240
um by the way my name is Dan faltisco

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,220
I'm a channel sales engineer with sofos

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,560
and everybody can hear me right

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,480
I'm normally a pretty loud guy so I

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,519
don't even need a mic half the time

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,519
uh I cover uh the Mid-Atlantic region as

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,920
well as the central east region and um I

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,079
live in Cleveland so I came down the 77

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,719
to get here last night and um it was a

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,579
nice Scenic Drive I love driving through

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,620
the mountains of West Virginia so

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,800
um thanks for having me

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,760
so let's talk a little bit about the

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,719
survey the state of ransomware 2022 this

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,940
was not done by sofos this was done by

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,980
an independent researching organization

21
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,320
called Vance and born and um you know

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,539
they send out a survey once a year which

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,120
we commissioned and uh this year we got

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,019
back about 5600 respondents across 31

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,000
different countries and uh you know as

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,860
far as size of company we try to keep it

27
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,140
in our sweet spot which is that 100 user

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,180
to 5000 user range you know that's

29
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,220
that's really where we play as a as an

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,900
organization so that's what we're mostly

31
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,000
interested in hearing about

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,619
um the survey was done back in January

33
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,320
and February of this year

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,479
so this is mostly the highlights if you

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,400
wanted to read the whole report and you

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,680
guys are more than welcome to

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,820
um you can literally just Google state

38
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,799
of ransomware 2022 sofos and you know

39
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,840
you get a PDF it's pretty long it's got

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,700
a lot more information in here I'm just

41
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,079
going to give you all the cool quick

42
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,900
hitters right the first one was that uh

43
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,579
you know adversaries are becoming more

44
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,700
successful in uh encrypting data not

45
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,140
just launching attacks but also wouldn't

46
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,119
actually succeeding and encrypting that

47
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,700
data so we saw a raise about nine nine

48
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,860
percent eleven percent

49
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,600
um year over year and the actual

50
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,579
successful encryption of data across the

51
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,799
the polls and across the people that we

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,119
pulled

53
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,399
and then subsequently we saw a decrease

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,040
year over year and the amount of

55
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,500
extortion only type of attacks so you

56
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,880
know we're going to lock your data and

57
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,819
then demand a ransom so this goes hand

58
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,140
in hand with what was talked about in

59
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,400
the keynote what they're talking about

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,160
it's not just about just holding you for

61
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,620
a ransom anywhere it's also we're going

62
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,000
to hold you for a ransom and we're going

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,920
to exfiltrate the data you might sell

64
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,540
that data we might

65
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,520
you know sell it back to you right you

66
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,660
know there's a number of different ways

67
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,879
they can monetize that information once

68
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,520
they have their hands on it

69
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,680
foreign

70
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,420
and then this goes towards a

71
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,160
conversation about

72
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,080
when you pay the ransom you know the

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,040
assumption is that you're going to get

74
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,540
your data back

75
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,420
no guys don't pay the ransom

76
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,819
that's number one don't pay the ransom I

77
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,560
shouldn't even be an option but if you

78
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,700
do pay the ransom you know the

79
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,080
Assumption as well I'm gonna get my data

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,480
back that's why I'm paying this Ransom

81
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,000
uh 61 of the time you'll get some data

82
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,920
back

83
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,900
how many anybody want to guess how much

84
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,180
time how much how often people get their

85
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,760
full data back

86
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,280
zero it's higher than zero

87
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,860
higher than zero two a little bit higher

88
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,060
than I'll

89
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,080
thank you for your audience

90
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,780
participation

91
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,980
it's actually down year over year but

92
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,599
it's about four percent of the time they

93
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,400
get all their data back

94
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,840
you're paying this Ransom and you're not

95
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,680
getting all your data back

96
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,300
take that money that you would have done

97
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,860
and invest it in a good backup system a

98
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,819
good cyber security system

99
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,040
it is becoming more challenging

100
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,540
um this is you know from the words of

101
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,819
the people that got hit right they're

102
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,260
getting hit more often they're getting

103
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,700
hit again

104
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,620
right you have to pay the ransom and

105
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,420
then six months later they get attacked

106
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,319
again

107
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,940
because they didn't adequately clean out

108
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,580
or remediate that threat

109
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,400
right it's becoming more complex right

110
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,080
we're not just seeing the phishing

111
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,000
attacks that lead to an automated

112
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,519
scripting attack we're seeing people

113
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,739
taking advantage of exploits what we

114
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,360
call a no touch breach

115
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,860
they don't touch anybody at the

116
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,019
organization they just get in through an

117
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:08,519
open port

118
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,560
an open exploit on a publicly available

119
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,939
server

120
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,860
which spoiler alert is what I'm going to

121
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,239
talk about in a little bit when we talk

122
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:16,858
about the black cat group and how they

123
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,159
got it

124
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,779
and the recovery is becoming uh it's

125
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,940
becoming more complex about a month to

126
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,300
recover

127
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,280
Now by vertical this changes right so

128
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,560
the slowest if you can imagine is

129
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,180
actually higher ed

130
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,820
and government shocking right that

131
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,440
government is the slowest to recover

132
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,419
sorry for anybody here that's on a

133
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:40,680
government agency but I think you kind

134
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,639
of know

135
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,680
you kind of you can agree with me it's

136
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,360
okay

137
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,979
yeah

138
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:49,380
now interestingly enough the fastest one

139
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,880
so by the way the average was a month

140
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,080
right

141
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,940
um higher ed was about three months to

142
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,440
recover right so these are major

143
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,060
universities or you know community

144
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,199
colleges

145
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,580
right so they just have a lot of

146
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,259
disparate systems all over the place so

147
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,400
it's it's tough for them to cover

148
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,199
centralized governments just have a lot

149
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,940
of bureaucracy and that's why it takes

150
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,400
them longer to cover about two months

151
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,440
interestingly enough the fastest ones

152
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,600
were the fastest for exact opposite

153
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,840
reasons yeah manufacturing and

154
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,020
production as the fastest to recover

155
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,699
because what is manufacturing and

156
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,759
production do is reimage the system now

157
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,520
yeah that one blocked out okay great no

158
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,259
I'll reimage it I don't care what's on

159
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:29,460
that system

160
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,620
it's on the shop floor somewhere right

161
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,060
doesn't have anything too important on

162
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,479
it maybe they just don't care

163
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,919
Financial Services you would imagine

164
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,419
they would be the fastest to recover as

165
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:40,919
well right but that's because the

166
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,020
opposite exact opposite they have all

167
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,520
the procedures in place they have all

168
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,680
the compliance rules that are forcing

169
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,720
them to have a good recovery plan in

170
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,460
place and they're just financially

171
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,320
motivated to recover faster because the

172
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,120
longer they're down the more business

173
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,740
they're losing the more money they're

174
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,039
losing

175
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,720
so now let's talk a little bit and shift

176
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,100
a little bit and talk about this black

177
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,320
cat ransomware group and you know what

178
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,960
they did after uh they uh you know

179
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,240
breached into a system and and then you

180
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,060
know got the ransom so so what happened

181
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,460
so the black cat ransomware Group which

182
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,139
we'll talk about who they are and you

183
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:20,639
know what what the background is on them

184
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,660
a little bit

185
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,280
uh they broke into a school and

186
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,440
encrypted a U.S school not the one I'm

187
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,180
picturing here

188
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,780
but a university we'll just say that not

189
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,280
going to name names and shame anybody

190
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,560
it's nobody in West Virginia don't worry

191
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,740
it's on one of the coasts

192
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,500
they demanded a six hundred thousand

193
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,300
dollar Ransom

194
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,580
which was negotiated down to a hundred

195
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,520
thousand and then paid by the school all

196
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,259
right specifically the school cyber

197
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,039
insurance policy

198
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,940
but then what happens next week

199
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,419
social engineering guys I'm sorry

200
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,759
so who is Black Cat well the reason they

201
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,039
get the name actually internally they're

202
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,199
kind of known as Alpha with the under

203
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,120
you know the with the V instead of an a

204
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,160
that's what they call themselves but

205
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,620
they also are known as black cat because

206
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,240
when you go to a tour browser and you go

207
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,919
to their site there's that little icon

208
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:18,300
of a black cat

209
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,919
in there

210
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,800
in their you know Ransom note so this is

211
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,960
like it's a screen grab from their site

212
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,419
when you go to Tor and you launch into

213
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,360
their site to get the ransom note this

214
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,259
is what that looks like

215
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,240
um they were first seen around November

216
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,000
2021 and so we suspect

217
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,800
you know they've been active since that

218
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,479
time

219
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,340
as an organization

220
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,440
um as you may or may not know right A

221
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,639
lot of these organizations they they're

222
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,520
very nebulous in nature right you know

223
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,620
who's who's looking for who and you know

224
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,060
who's got what and what infrastructure

225
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,800
are they are they using all that stuff

226
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,000
like that right

227
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,340
uh they primarily Target Windows systems

228
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,960
they have ransomware that targets that

229
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,880
they also have ransomware that targets

230
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,979
ESX

231
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,800
um hypervisors they also have a Debian

232
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,220
and Ubuntu version of ransomware they go

233
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,660
after schools a lot

234
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,699
and the schools like using Ubuntu on

235
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,740
their in their labs

236
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,900
but they also have some some specific

237
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,639
stuff for some storage backups as well

238
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,699
like Readiness and Synology so so

239
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,139
they're pretty sophisticated as far as

240
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,840
the number of targets they can hit

241
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,520
as well as

242
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,979
um you know so we we think they're a

243
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,419
possible Rebrand

244
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,458
of Darkseid and black matter or

245
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,899
combination of them we see a lot of

246
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,700
familiar infrastructure

247
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,000
from those groups being shared

248
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,339
okay some similar Network some similar

249
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,380
connections right of groups that they

250
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,120
work with

251
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,800
um but they are very sophisticated so

252
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,839
this is one of the first ones kind of

253
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,640
makes these guys unique um at least for

254
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,740
now is they're one of the first ones to

255
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,560
actually be coding in Rust

256
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,880
you know and more secure newer

257
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,680
technology and new newer programming

258
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,080
language whereas you know things have

259
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,260
evolved from python now to to this to

260
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,200
you know whatever Ruby on Rails and C

261
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,640
plus plus and all this stuff in the back

262
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,080
day I used to program I used to do

263
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,740
Pascal and you know C plus plus in Java

264
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,560
and now it's all this new stuff

265
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,839
glad I'm on the engineering side now

266
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,540
that's all I got to say about that but

267
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,220
due to the fact that they are one of the

268
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,420
first ones to actually have some

269
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,860
ransomware written in this new language

270
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,019
we give them a high level sophistication

271
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,640
rating

272
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,320
they're not just copying and pasting

273
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,500
code

274
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,200
um so let's talk about the actual attack

275
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,399
I'm gonna go through the timeline of

276
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,000
what happened here

277
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,920
so the initial access was through a log

278
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,660
for J vulnerability

279
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,180
is anyone familiar with log4j by show of

280
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,220
hands I'm sure everybody had to go

281
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,959
through and Patch all their systems and

282
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:00,000
that was real fun right back in December

283
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,980
I think around like November December

284
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,320
time frame last year

285
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,660
quickly note um this attack you'll see a

286
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,100
timeline that was hard to see because of

287
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,839
the screens and everybody's sitting so

288
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,519
far in the back

289
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,100
um

290
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,380
June 2nd is the date that we saw the

291
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,540
initial access happen so June 2nd of

292
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,440
this year

293
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,260
so think about that it's six months ish

294
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,880
of unpatched

295
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,279
public facing Horizon

296
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,660
server

297
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,279
with log4j vulnerability

298
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,519
so you can imagine where my

299
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,200
recommendations come in after this

300
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,740
uh persistence was set up with wmi

301
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,019
um it was set to execute command every

302
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,480
15 minutes that connected to a Cobalt

303
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,420
strike loader that was posted or hosted

304
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,880
on on pastebin so that was the

305
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,320
persistence mechanism that was

306
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,000
established once they got that initial

307
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,680
access

308
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,540
and then we started seeing command and

309
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,300
control uh note and again it's hard to

310
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,640
see there's a 22-day difference here

311
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,100
between the initial access and that

312
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,800
persistence mechanism being launched and

313
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,959
the actual command and control beacons

314
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,339
that we started seeing afterwards right

315
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:12,959
so we started seeing some Cobalt strike

316
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,839
beacons on the 24th which was a Saturday

317
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,339
you know they love to hit you on the

318
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:21,360
weekends

319
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,180
because I know nobody's there

320
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,740
um this also is kind of indicative of

321
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,540
what we think might be happening is that

322
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,519
the initial access was done by a third

323
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,459
party and that access was sold to black

324
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:33,839
cap

325
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,360
or they bought that access from a

326
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,040
database so I don't think we don't think

327
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,839
black hat was actually the ones that to

328
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,640
do the initial access and the

329
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,260
persistence they were just the ones that

330
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,140
happened to be like hey can I uh get a

331
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,120
couple uh schools that we can launch a

332
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,980
ransomware against

333
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,440
yes please

334
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,839
use their affiliate networks to do that

335
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,120
now from this command and control

336
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,100
there's some rapid fire stuff happening

337
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,180
right

338
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,160
so we see execution of some Powershell

339
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,440
commands that are used to connect up to

340
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,420
a command and controls infrastructure

341
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,480
and then download some additional tools

342
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,440
we see RDP actions so internal RDP this

343
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,360
is not you know you know they didn't

344
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,040
have RDP exposed to the internet but

345
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,339
obviously internally they're using RDP

346
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,860
and didn't have that blocked off

347
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,079
so they were using those tools against

348
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,219
them living on land

349
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,660
saw some more commit uh Cobalt strike

350
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,040
beacons this time going to another place

351
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,860
and then it was renamed as SVC host very

352
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,079
common thing that we'll see they like to

353
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,579
obfuscate what they're actually

354
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,320
launching so that it's look like it's

355
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,820
just a normal system process running

356
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,279
started installing some other remote

357
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,800
access tools some things like

358
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,320
any desk Splashtop

359
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,519
these are tools that system

360
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,200
administrators might use

361
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,000
so again they they try to use those

362
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,720
tools against you

363
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,459
now the collection this is interesting

364
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:03,959
right so the collection was done with

365
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,120
WinRAR and WinZip

366
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,880
or seven zip rather

367
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,920
um they installed those applications on

368
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,899
their file servers and then tried to

369
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,720
extract those files or zip up those

370
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,480
files they got about 10.6 gigs of data

371
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,639
all said and done and so remember that

372
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,519
number 10.6 gigs of data is what they

373
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,220
were able to exfiltrate or get

374
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,320
they tried to copy a student database

375
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,300
that student database was about

376
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,600
400 gigs worth

377
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,700
the problem was for them was that

378
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,040
student database was actually in use and

379
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,540
so they couldn't

380
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,060
extract that file they couldn't copy

381
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,040
that file because the database was

382
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,360
actually in use

383
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,760
so that that failed but it's important

384
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,920
to remember that database is 400 gigs

385
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,839
they only got about 10 gigs all overall

386
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,480
could have been a lot worse

387
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,779
it's a actor did not luck out in this

388
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,139
case

389
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:03,779
after that they uploaded it to my

390
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:07,139
favorite site in the world mega.nz

391
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,060
so Mega is used by a lot of threat

392
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,740
actors to Stage stuff

393
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,260
you guys remember kim.com and all his

394
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,139
drama that's his uh his file sharing

395
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,380
site

396
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,260
still around still being used and you

397
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,880
probably should block that in your

398
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,220
networks it says nobody needs to use

399
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,360
that for legitimate reasons

400
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,940
um and then after they extracted the

401
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,800
data this is where the fun starts right

402
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,360
so now we're on the 25th so this is

403
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,399
Sunday now

404
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,660
um now they start going okay well we

405
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,240
extracted the data we exfiltrated it

406
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,860
uh now we're gonna go start looking

407
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,120
around we're gonna start poking around

408
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,500
we're going to SSH into a number

409
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,779
although they're hypervisors another

410
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:52,380
number a bunch of VMware servers and

411
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,240
start understanding what's out there

412
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,579
we're going to use not.exe we're going

413
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,740
to use ping start doing some discovery

414
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,839
on the network

415
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,540
um you guys can see where this is going

416
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,860
we're trying to figure out where they

417
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,139
can go we're going to set up a scheduled

418
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,300
test called Chrome guess what it's not

419
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,639
launching Chrome

420
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,680
it's going to point them to their domain

421
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,839
controller slash net logon slash

422
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,000
chrome.exe that chrome.exe is actually

423
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,760
the launcher for their ransomware

424
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,620
so they did it with an active directory

425
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,279
GPO policy script to start on Startup

426
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,720
pretty

427
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,300
you know say a pretty unsophisticated

428
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,979
way of doing it but it's very effective

429
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,360
and so uh you know Sunday about 5 a.m in

430
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,279
the morning

431
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,260
um the ransomware is deployed

432
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:50,220
to 420 or 450 servers and 1200 endpoints

433
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,320
they also hot you know

434
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,079
targeted the VMware hosts with their own

435
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,860
Linux variant that was more individually

436
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,260
we stopped it on the endpoints they did

437
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,740
not have sofos installed on the servers

438
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,300
I'm not going to name the company they

439
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,800
had on the servers I'm not here to bash

440
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,420
anybody

441
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,100
um so the whole reason we were brought

442
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,899
in in the first place was because we

443
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,120
stopped it on the endpoints and they

444
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,420
called us and said hey uh we got hit

445
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,820
um you stopped it thank you but

446
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,800
um our servers are all encrypted what

447
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,720
can you do to help us out so we brought

448
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,459
our team in and started doing this

449
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,019
forensic analysis getting the root cause

450
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,579
and that's how we know all this

451
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,880
information

452
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,660
interesting enough afterwards they stuck

453
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,339
around

454
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:41,160
they used a compromised account they

455
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,019
already had access to to create a new

456
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,660
user called administrailer not

457
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,699
administrator

458
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:49,860
a huge tip there and promoted that

459
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,019
person to a domain admin

460
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,399
so you can see what they were doing here

461
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,959
they were doing that for for one of two

462
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,000
reasons right uh you know we suspect

463
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,759
they were doing it to monitor for post

464
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,920
Ware activity

465
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,360
um also they were trying to maybe be

466
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,740
persistent so they can launch another

467
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,780
attack in six months if they don't get

468
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,379
discovered

469
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,720
and then the ransom note was left behind

470
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,599
introducing who they were what they did

471
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,459
you can't see this here but

472
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,020
in the ransomware note they claim to

473
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,720
have exfiltrated 500 gigs of data I

474
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,000
wonder where they got that number from

475
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,559
remember I told you before they actually

476
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,380
only got 10.6 gigs of data

477
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,419
but that student database was about 400

478
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,799
gigs itself

479
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,539
so they thought they got

480
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,600
the student database too or at least

481
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,460
they knew that they could say that they

482
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,419
got to the super database

483
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,620
school had no idea they you know they

484
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,419
read this and said 500 gigs of our data

485
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:49,200
they must have gotten our school

486
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,059
database our student database we have to

487
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:52,860
pay this

488
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,679
so lesson here

489
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,320
um these guys will lie

490
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,179
they won't be honest

491
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,799
and they you know don't trust what they

492
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,660
say don't take everything that they put

493
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,520
in their ransomware notes at space value

494
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,559
do some investigation find out what the

495
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,120
actual impact was

496
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,220
so what happened next well

497
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,660
they're in you know the school's

498
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,640
incident response plan went into play

499
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,500
so I guess what their incident response

500
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,919
plan was

501
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,480
they didn't call us first actually they

502
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,620
called their cyber insurance company

503
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,700
first

504
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,140
that was their incident response plan

505
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,840
hey we've been hacked

506
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,900
right I used to before I was at sofas I

507
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,419
was at FireEye mandian and one of the

508
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,520
the jokes we used to say all the time

509
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,320
back then was like we're usually the

510
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,720
third person that an organization calls

511
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,580
the first ones to the lawyer the second

512
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,960
one's their cyber insurance and third

513
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,660
one's to mandian right

514
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,320
so

515
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,580
um but yeah that's that their whole

516
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,200
incident response plan was call our

517
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,940
insurance company because they they were

518
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,500
covered

519
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,900
cyber insurance company then engaged

520
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,360
a number of different organizations one

521
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,980
of those organizations that they engaged

522
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,679
was a negotiating organization

523
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,419
that negotiated the ransomware down to

524
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,840
100k from 600k on their behalf and then

525
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,340
they paid that the insurance company

526
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,740
paid it

527
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:13,559
then after the fact they

528
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,720
were contacted by Sophos because we saw

529
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,940
a bunch of alerts in their console and

530
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,559
we said hey um we think you may have

531
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,760
been hit with ransomware and they said

532
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,260
yeah actually we were

533
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,700
um well would you like us to come in and

534
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,500
help you clean that up like we didn't

535
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,880
know they already paid the ransom they

536
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,860
said well we're in negotiation with our

537
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,539
insurance company but yes please come in

538
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:31,919
and help us

539
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,900
so that's where we came in we did this

540
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,179
remediation we found out you know the

541
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:37,440
root cause and all that stuff like that

542
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,700
that's how we know so much about this

543
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,919
when we were out there doing our rapid

544
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:42,900
response engagement with this

545
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,340
organization

546
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,220
um we found this nice little thing

547
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,960
report.txt was uh left behind by

548
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,940
administrailer

549
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,539
the administrator password person and um

550
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:55,799
and it's very interesting and very

551
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,419
telling what you see in this document

552
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,820
and uh hopefully you can read some of

553
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,280
this but if not I will try my best to

554
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,960
read it for you

555
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,419
so these points should

556
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:08,700
answer most questions if you want to

557
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,860
know anything else or have problems with

558
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,260
decryption please let us know

559
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,480
very nice customer service by the way by

560
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,980
these guys

561
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,840
uh you had an old critical log for J

562
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,059
vulnerability that's what that's how we

563
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,100
got it

564
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,600
uh this is how we're able to get

565
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,940
initially it was bulk scanning it's not

566
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,340
like we were targeting you intentionally

567
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,380
that's a lie

568
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,900
because again we suspect that they

569
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,179
weren't black cat was not the ones

570
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,179
that did the actual initial access we

571
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:40,799
think that they they had bought this

572
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,720
access from a third party so they were

573
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,580
targeting education markets we know

574
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,380
black cat does they have special

575
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,480
variants designed for things like Ubuntu

576
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,580
which a lot of schools use

577
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,960
so yeah they were targeting them

578
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,299
somewhat maybe not the schools

579
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:56,760
specifically but they just made it easy

580
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,660
they were low-hanging fruit

581
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,299
once inside your horizon virtual machine

582
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:06,539
we dumped credentials got the domain

583
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,700
admin cracked the hash

584
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,700
and we're able to move laterally

585
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,980
yeah I love this part it is absolute

586
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,620
Madness to have 3 000 computers all on

587
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,020
the same domain

588
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,160
that's what happened in this

589
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,660
organization they were all on the same

590
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,820
same domain you should segment your

591
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,460
network into other things like teachers

592
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,200
faculty Financial

593
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,380
Etc

594
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,700
you get the idea so if one domain is

595
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,200
infiltrated somehow not all the

596
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,820
infrastructure will be compromised so

597
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,120
this is a university organization it's a

598
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,500
community college

599
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,720
and uh they had everything all in one

600
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,280
domain One Flat domain

601
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,620
also subsequently One Flat Network too

602
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,580
so of course

603
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,559
also you should routinely review

604
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,299
sensitive information like passports

605
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,460
bank accounts and so on to have them on

606
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,460
different domains so

607
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,140
how are they able to get some access to

608
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,960
some of the passwords

609
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,120
guess what teachers like to do or you

610
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,620
know administrators like to do sometimes

611
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,720
I'm going to have a little file on my

612
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,580
computer called passwords.text that I'm

613
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,720
going to keep all my passwords on

614
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,640
because I can't remember things and I

615
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,900
don't want to bother with you know

616
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,700
something like bit Warden or key pass or

617
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,780
whatever those things though

618
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,059
here's a tip do a directory slash s

619
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:25,799
slash a

620
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:28,860
and look for you know asterisk passport

621
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,840
asterisk or just pass because that'll

622
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,880
get passports and passwords

623
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,679
you'd be surprised what you find in an

624
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:37,679
organization by doing that

625
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,520
so yeah yeah password passport.pdf I see

626
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,799
those in organizations doing forensics

627
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,340
let's see password.tax password.excel

628
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,159
right I've seen one that says keep it

629
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,220
secret dot XLS it's like well at least

630
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,980
it wasn't named passwords.xls right but

631
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,960
it was still a it was a list of all

632
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,159
their passwords

633
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:00,659
for their whole domain by the way that

634
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,820
was a that was a domain admin that

635
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,780
didn't want to trust their uh their

636
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,600
password management tool

637
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,159
even better is when you have a password

638
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:12,780
management tool but then you keep the

639
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,100
password for your password management

640
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,260
tool on a text file somewhere it's like

641
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,700
okay I'm just going to throw the key

642
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,080
right there in the open for anybody to

643
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,900
see right I have seen that before too

644
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,760
uh once the network was scanned we went

645
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,559
for the backup servers which you should

646
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,120
have on a different domain under five

647
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,200
different Keys into Factor

648
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,460
authentication I don't know about five

649
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,919
different keys but certainly

650
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,320
securing your backups is important so I

651
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,640
I tend to agree with them a little bit

652
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,100
here what I don't agree with them is on

653
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,799
the next sentence where they say oh yeah

654
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,720
don't use any massively used backup

655
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,720
software it's a gold mine for us

656
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,460
it's kind of like implying that they

657
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,320
have like some ways to get around backup

658
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,880
software

659
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,559
um you know use backup software just

660
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,799
make sure you test it and you secure it

661
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,980
uh you know can't go deeper on that oh

662
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,120
but

663
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,520
don't use any of the big names

664
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,760
okay yeah whatever they lie don't trust

665
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,240
what they say

666
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,380
I used to work at a company called

667
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,900
acronis right you know and uh they do

668
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,880
backup software

669
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,740
you know it's all about making sure you

670
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,840
have a good good system in place to

671
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,100
support that backup software make sure

672
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,840
you test your backups make sure you

673
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,760
actually try to do a sample recovery

674
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,960
every now and then even if it's just

675
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,159
once a year

676
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,720
tests that you can actually recover from

677
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,760
your backups once a year

678
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,140
you have no idea how many organizations

679
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,059
don't do that

680
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,240
foreign

681
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,820
it should be clear to you that having a

682
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,200
database of passwords for all service

683
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,120
services and services is on the local

684
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,400
network it took us a few days to verify

685
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,840
the credentials and make a plan of

686
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,280
attack

687
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,559
so they had a you know again a database

688
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,120
basically that was open that had all

689
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,120
their passwords for the domain

690
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,679
and I had to put this in here because it

691
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:56,940
was a nice shout out to us we have to

692
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,960
say Sophos was good AV

693
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,940
however no one monitors the logs on your

694
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,620
network and at least they don't do it on

695
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,500
the weekends no notice I mentioned they

696
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,140
got hit on Saturday and Sunday

697
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,159
right

698
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:12,960
the best AV in the world the best

699
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,220
endpoint protection in the world the

700
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,960
best EDR and xdr tools in the world

701
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,220
aren't going to do anything if nobody's

702
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,320
looking at that data or taking action

703
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,940
from that

704
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,080
we could do only so much

705
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:25,980
General recommendations install hard

706
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,200
derive hard to override antivirus such

707
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,240
as sofo silence not a lot of the blank

708
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,890
host guys

709
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,440
[Laughter]

710
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,600
yeah having a good AV program a good

711
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,700
endpoint protection is is very vital

712
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,020
right but it's not the only thing right

713
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,760
obligatory two-factor authentication

714
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,779
should be

715
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:45,360
enabled on the input again some of this

716
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,860
is broken English right

717
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,279
basically use two-factor Authentication

718
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,380
for anything that's system critical if

719
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,620
you can

720
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,320
using an EDR or xdr tool set right

721
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,260
that's the term now is xdr right

722
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,940
um having some kind of a managed

723
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,240
services to monitor that for you

724
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,919
especially if you don't have your own 24

725
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,580
7 by 365 shop to do it

726
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,340
those are good suggestions

727
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,500
because it's useless if they're not not

728
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,200
looking at that stuff

729
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,480
another one another shout out I would

730
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,740
say for your organization like yours

731
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,480
sofos is good

732
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,940
but no need to buy 3 000 licenses just

733
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,340
throw it on the servers

734
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,480
you don't need to worry about those

735
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,740
stingy endpoints we don't care about

736
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,480
those things

737
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,400
throw it on your DC and file servers

738
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,080
they don't even say all your servers

739
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,400
they just say it does the DC and file

740
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,400
servers so again these guys will lie

741
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,100
please don't just install outside

742
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,020
one piece of your environment and that's

743
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,240
it try to get it a good endpoint

744
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,500
protection solution whether it's us or

745
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,360
others on everything in the environment

746
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,760
AV is not Magic

747
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,940
right even with so close we can bypass

748
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,120
it I agree we could be bypassed if you

749
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,860
know what you're doing if you know the

750
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,659
ins and outs of it

751
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,760
but it will stop most of the attacks and

752
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,260
it's more important that you hire

753
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,240
someone to look at the locks

754
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,480
yeah

755
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,659
I I do I do get paid now to tell people

756
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,900
that

757
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,799
uh whatever two you know two-factor

758
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,480
authentication hammering home that you

759
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,100
know at least for domain admins got to

760
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,720
have some two-factor authentication I

761
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,159
would say for anybody with access to

762
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:39,360
system critical Services absolutely

763
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,100
you should have trained people looking

764
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,000
at this data okay we get that point

765
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,799
here we go it's been an honor working

766
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,740
with you

767
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,900
we have to say we don't like to blank

768
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,360
over schools or kids this is just

769
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,159
business

770
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,380
and it's being a cheap lesson for you

771
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,820
we've done broken English here it's

772
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,500
being a cheap lesson for you you can't

773
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,240
have thousands of PCS on the same domain

774
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,340
with insensitive files or with sensitive

775
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,779
files accessible to anyone and without

776
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:09,539
anyone monitoring your logs

777
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:11,820
we are just Money Motivated

778
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,659
no offense basically are bad

779
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:17,100
thank you for your hundred thousand

780
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,480
dollars that you got the insurance

781
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,059
company to pay and by the way if this

782
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:22,080
didn't tip you off that they didn't

783
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,580
really know who they were targeting this

784
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,740
is a us-based school and that the last

785
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,659
line of their thing is like best wishes

786
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:29,880
keep up the good maple syrup and trucker

787
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,419
protests

788
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,860
they didn't even know who they were

789
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,059
hidden they thought it was a Canadian

790
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:38,299
School

791
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,080
and of course they signed a black hat

792
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,400
if it's out there it's out there maybe

793
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,460
they were doing trucker protests I don't

794
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,840
know I don't know so that's that's my

795
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,760
fun my fun story you hear about that

796
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,799
straight from their words right

797
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,080
what's most important multi-factor

798
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,400
authentication securing your access

799
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,720
right

800
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,480
making sure you have good backups

801
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,220
making sure you're actually looking at

802
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,779
the logs make sure you're collecting the

803
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:06,080
logs

804
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:07,860
so let's talk a little bit more about

805
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,720
the role of cyber insurance and shifting

806
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,580
back to that survey that we had

807
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,080
um we have about 92 percent of our

808
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,580
respondents said yeah we got cyber

809
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,699
insurance

810
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,840
83 of them have cyber shirts that covers

811
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,820
ransomware specifically

812
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,220
but then 34 of those have something

813
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,140
called policy exclusion if anybody here

814
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,240
working with cyber insurance

815
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,799
you know what a policy exclusion may be

816
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:35,159
see some people don't know what that is

817
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,899
policy exclusion is basically saying hey

818
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:38,460
yeah if these certain conditions are met

819
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,399
we're not going to cover you

820
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,440
so let's do the math real quick about

821
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,140
less than 50 percent of our respondents

822
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,240
actually had what I would consider true

823
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,860
cyber security Insurance because it

824
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:53,418
covered ransomware with no exclusions

825
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:58,340
it has gotten harder to secure

826
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,059
cyber insurance companies are in it for

827
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,559
the money too

828
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,179
they're trying to mitigate their risk

829
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:04,799
and so they're pushing down more rules

830
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,080
they're pushing down more requirements

831
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,200
to get this kind of coverage

832
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,779
this is forcing businesses to adapt

833
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:14,520
we have to you know increase our

834
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,340
security posture in order to qualify for

835
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,960
this insurance

836
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,640
so the biggest one the last two years

837
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,620
has been the requirement of two-factor

838
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,419
Authentication

839
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:26,340
what we're starting to see now is more

840
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,760
of a requirement on EDR or xdr tools and

841
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,760
the actual ability to look at that data

842
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,380
you have to actually prove to the sub

843
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,120
insurance companies and some of some are

844
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,039
requiring some are not everybody's

845
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,120
different

846
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,200
um they're actually requiring that you

847
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,760
prove that you have a monitoring plan in

848
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,620
place

849
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,480
to avoid things like what happened to

850
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,899
that school

851
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,059
here's the good news

852
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,880
they almost always pay out something

853
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,580
98 of the time they paid up

854
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,980
it's a pretty good rate considering

855
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,260
only 83 actually had cyber insurance

856
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,340
that covered ransomware

857
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,179
most of the times they're covering

858
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:08,460
things like cleanup costs this is the

859
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,279
costs associated with you know bringing

860
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,020
a company like ours in to do remediation

861
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,360
or you know cleaning it up yourselves or

862
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,159
the the Lost business that you would

863
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:19,200
have right you know all that stuff that

864
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,460
goes into the cleanup costs

865
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:25,020
um and actually it's trending down

866
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,820
seeing less paying for the ransom

867
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,140
outright

868
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,899
still about 40 percent

869
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:33,179
and depending on your country and the

870
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:34,740
Cyber insurance company that you work

871
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,720
with it could be lower

872
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,000
but we are seeing that that trending

873
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,620
down

874
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,799
by the way don't pay the ransom

875
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:46,700
all right so to sum up

876
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,200
it's a you know ransomware is still a

877
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,340
challenge that's why you know the

878
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,080
Keynotes about ransomware my socks about

879
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,820
ransomware you're gonna keep hearing it

880
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,919
until it goes away

881
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,080
I would say other than ransomware highly

882
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,580
business email compromise is the next

883
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,080
biggest one that we see all the time

884
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,179
that's where somebody you know gets

885
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:04,500
access to a mailbox either through

886
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,720
Office 365 or some other way and they

887
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,399
used to do a software engineering attack

888
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,320
internal to the company

889
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,120
hey send me over some gift cards right

890
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,559
that kind of stuff

891
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:14,700
that's probably the number two but

892
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,700
ransomware is absolutely number one

893
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,500
our team that comes out and does these

894
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,480
rapid response engagements

895
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,760
on about 90 percent of the time we're

896
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,620
responding to ransomware attack

897
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,039
but it is getting better you know where

898
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:34,620
our tools are increasing our

899
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,059
capabilities are increasing and that's

900
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,980
being driven by cyber insurance

901
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,659
cyber insurance is requiring us to have

902
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:40,980
these tools that have these these

903
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,500
methodologies in place and um in order

904
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,720
to get coverage so we're we're up in our

905
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,419
game collectively which is good

906
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:51,419
still not the end of the day

907
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:52,799
I'm still going to have a little bit

908
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,360
more to go and who knows what's going to

909
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,860
happen next right what's the next big

910
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,720
thing to drop because it is a cat and

911
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,480
mouse game we all know that

912
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,539
our top five tips

913
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:05,640
unlike this uh unlike what black cat

914
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,860
recommended make sure you have good high

915
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,440
quality defenses across your whole state

916
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,779
that's not just endpoint but also you

917
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:14,220
know in your network

918
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,120
on the inter Network scanning right

919
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,360
looking for that stuff like RDP access

920
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,860
internally on a Saturday morning

921
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,380
probably not an admin working I would

922
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,039
say

923
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:28,559
might be a bad guy

924
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,720
proactively hunt for threats

925
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,860
it's not just enough to get the

926
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,600
visibility from the xdr tools and

927
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,700
obviously visibility into what's going

928
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,860
on that's what I call suspicious but not

929
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,840
necessarily malicious activity

930
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,519
right your Powershell usage and things

931
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,620
like that are happening Gathering that

932
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,260
data is one thing but actually

933
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,880
proactively threat hunting off that data

934
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,340
is is a key thing that needs to happen

935
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,419
work with the services partner if you

936
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:56,580
can't do it yourselves but you have that

937
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,939
capability

938
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,559
how about incident response plan and

939
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,179
hopefully it's better than just calling

940
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:05,899
my insurance company

941
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,140
let's talk about in the keynote about

942
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,659
doing tabletop exercises I love that

943
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,280
you know get everybody in the room and

944
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,260
and actually make them tell you what

945
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,699
they're going to do in the actual

946
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,800
incident no better way to test whether

947
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,820
or not they actually know what they're

948
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,139
talking about and they just haven't just

949
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,119
wrote an up a document and that's it

950
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,560
test it

951
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,719
same thing with backups

952
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,879
still your last line of defense

953
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,980
make sure you test those and make sure

954
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,239
you test restoring from those

955
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,219
specifically

956
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,139
so that being said

957
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,940
I'm all done like I said I'll give you

958
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,800
back some time in your day but I'll also

959
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,179
be here for questions

960
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,159
so any questions before

961
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,020
I end official yes

962
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,560
absolutely

963
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,900
yeah I I do another presentation all the

964
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,160
time I talk about getting the best bang

965
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,119
for your buck

966
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:09,060
right smbs especially you know you know

967
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,619
what do they want to cover is a priority

968
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,660
because you only have so much funds

969
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,760
right um I always say look at where the

970
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,020
attacks are coming

971
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,820
number one vector of attack is still

972
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,660
email

973
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,180
so protect your email is number one I

974
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,820
say one a1b right 1B would be your

975
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,560
endpoints because all attacks eventually

976
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,500
hit the server or desktop

977
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,780
on your system so if you had all your

978
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,280
you know if you only had limited funds

979
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,680
where do I invest those funds in from a

980
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,540
pure protection perspective

981
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,220
email and endpoint

982
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,720
from there then you look at things like

983
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,579
firewalls Network Telemetry maybe

984
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,560
getting that log collection and stuff

985
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,140
like that but that's all you know at a

986
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,380
premium for smbs right and this as I

987
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,400
mentioned before that's where service

988
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,680
provider Partners come into play you

989
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,839
might find a more

990
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:58,200
uh attractive option from uh managed

991
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,060
security provider or something like that

992
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,460
that can bundle those Solutions and

993
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,260
their monitoring service into one kind

994
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,119
of like monthly fee that makes a lot

995
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,339
easier for you to operationalize as a as

996
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:10,320
a small business so yeah absolutely

997
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,579
those are the things I would recommend

998
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:13,859
but if you had no if you had very little

999
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:15,240
money you know all you could do is

1000
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,280
invest in one or two things email an

1001
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,640
endpoint

1002
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,599
without the policy exception yeah

1003
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:31,220
yeah

1004
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,240
policy exclusion poly exception whatever

1005
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,899
you want to call it yeah

1006
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,440
okay

1007
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,440
yeah

1008
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,719
[Music]

1009
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,040
yeah I I think I get what you're coming

1010
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,380
at and so the question or the or the the

1011
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,900
statement is more around well yeah these

1012
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,119
insurance companies will assure you but

1013
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,460
do they always pay out and they'll find

1014
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,260
a way to not want to cover you and one

1015
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,400
of those things could be like well it

1016
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,980
was part of the discovery process right

1017
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,660
part of the remediation process they

1018
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,040
find out that the way they got in was

1019
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,079
because you had a 20 year old on patched

1020
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,220
server well guess what that insurance

1021
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,480
company is going to come back to you and

1022
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,180
say sorry you're disqualified

1023
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,259
we're not going to cover you

1024
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,500
yeah and and a lot of security yeah a

1025
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,520
lot of cyber security insurance

1026
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,520
companies are being more uh more

1027
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,700
adamant about proving ahead of time

1028
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,800
before you even get coverage that's why

1029
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,300
it's so much harder now to get Cyber

1030
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,640
insurance company coverage like that

1031
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,839
um so they are being more adamant about

1032
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:14,460
hey it's not just enough to fill out the

1033
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,320
form and say yes I do I attest to this

1034
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,400
or whatever

1035
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,200
um you actually have to show me your

1036
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,760
audit logs and your audit reports and

1037
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,160
things like that we're seeing that you

1038
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,380
know I'm not on the Cyber Insurance uh

1039
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,880
you know board or anything like that but

1040
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,579
I have seen I have seen instances where

1041
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:32,099
Insurance did not pay for

1042
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:34,640
our services after the fact because

1043
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,780
they've we found out that they were

1044
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,300
running you know Windows 7 machines that

1045
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,300
are no longer able to be patched or end

1046
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,820
of life two years ago by Microsoft right

1047
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,099
so you know we've seen instances of that

1048
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:48,540
happening in the Cyber insurance company

1049
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,220
but yes you're definitely seeing them

1050
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,020
becoming more proactive the Cyber

1051
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,280
insurance companies be more proactive

1052
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,859
about forcing you to prove that you're

1053
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:57,540
actually on your game before you can

1054
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,220
qualify

1055
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,599
because they're trying to mitigate their

1056
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,980
risk

1057
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,420
right

1058
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,380
they don't want to pay

1059
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,500
any other questions

1060
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,700
[Music]

1061
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,579
maybe maybe at some point uh I you know

1062
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:22,619
and by the way that that note was

1063
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:24,060
exactly the way it was written and they

1064
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,619
they put Sophos in there like two or

1065
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:26,700
three times they put some other vendors

1066
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,260
in there I blanked them out just because

1067
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,240
you know setting the one silence all

1068
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,099
those guys right and stuff like that

1069
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:34,200
um but yeah yeah you know

1070
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,760
um in fact you know in the Conte League

1071
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,380
you know there was some chatter there

1072
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,460
was some stuff that we took from

1073
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,560
marketing for sofos there was a whole

1074
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,880
thread in the Conte leak of them

1075
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,440
bitching about how much we were stopping

1076
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,599
them from Dodge and their ransomware

1077
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,339
um so yeah it you know we do a really

1078
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:48,660
good job on the protection side right

1079
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,240
but it's not 100 as you can see you know

1080
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,859
they'll find ways around even our

1081
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:54,720
software especially if nobody's looking

1082
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,119
at their logs now they they were able to

1083
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,859
launch an attack in two days right but

1084
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:00,359
if they hadn't lost the actual

1085
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:01,740
ransomware I bet you they could have

1086
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,820
been sitting there for another couple

1087
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,980
weeks if they wanted to because nobody

1088
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,839
was monitoring their logs so if they

1089
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:08,339
wanted to play it slow they could have

1090
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,780
found a way around our software and

1091
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,940
being able to encrypt every machine

1092
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,800
they were looking for a quicker payout

1093
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,520
though and they got it

1094
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,880
uh any more questions I appreciate

1095
