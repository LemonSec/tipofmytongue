1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,519
welcome to Career who's looking for a

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,019
job

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,660
who's looking for a better job

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,660
you come to the right place

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,720
pretty much all of us right

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,820
so we work in the technical disciplines

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,160
and in the technical disciplines

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,779
uh we rely on education and

9
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,699
certification for a great deal of where

10
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,520
we go and how things work

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,739
but there are wrinkles to it which is

12
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:35,940
one of the things that this talk is

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,280
going to cover because

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,680
when you're young and

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,140
uh don't have as much knowledge about

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,000
how some of this stuff works there's a

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,100
tendency to go get education I need to

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,719
go get a degree I mean our mom's told us

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,879
you know you need to get a degree you

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,460
need to go to college

21
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,280
the truth is much uh more interesting

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,940
than that wow I got a wide sweep here

23
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,920
you know you guys wanted to move over

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,539
here that would save my dad

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,320
another one anyways uh there's lots of

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,840
things that are different about where we

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,260
go in Tech if you want to work in stem

28
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,580
that is much more applicable you know

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,740
you need a PhD you need education you

30
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,540
need certain qualifications if you want

31
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,560
to work in information security

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,140
forensics you don't need any of that you

33
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,640
need capabilities I mean they're nice to

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,619
have and we'll talk about when it's

35
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,119
appropriate to get them and how's the

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,979
best way to get them but there's lots of

37
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,080
different options there so

38
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,780
the other piece is where you go and what

39
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,060
time in your career it is

40
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,479
so let's dig into it

41
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,759
uh we're going to talk about me for like

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,680
two seconds because I don't care

43
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,299
um how to get in from zero so if you

44
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,460
have no background in security forensics

45
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,259
or some sort of technical field how to

46
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,939
go about getting into that technical

47
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,259
field

48
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,600
if you have some that's great uh and

49
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,460
then the other flip side here is if you

50
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,380
are in the technical field and you're

51
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,899
trying to transition

52
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:03,899
so say you are an ASE auto mechanic and

53
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,460
you decide you want to work in forensics

54
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,220
because being an ASE model mechanic

55
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,020
isn't quite the dream job that you

56
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,580
thought it was going to be

57
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,220
uh there are aspects and ways to do that

58
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,140
that are better than others and we'll

59
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,819
talk about transitioning and how to get

60
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,920
from different places and then just the

61
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,360
general concepts of how to find a good

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,800
how to find a better job

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,319
it works out well

64
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,540
and then retiring getting out all the

65
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,519
stuff in between it's easy enough

66
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,860
uh okay so I own some companies their

67
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,420
lifestyle companies don't get excited

68
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,580
I'm not rich or anything but I have been

69
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,860
a ciso at a large startup I have been

70
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,879
assisted with a large Healthcare

71
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,800
organization I've done some pretty cool

72
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,379
stuff with AI uh I know lots of stuff

73
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:47,760
about technology I've probably forgotten

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,440
more about it than anything else really

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,319
dig QR codes which is weird but okay

76
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,060
all right how to get in from zero

77
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,800
um how many people are looking for their

78
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,580
first career position

79
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,920
okay

80
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,860
how many people were doing something

81
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,480
else

82
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,360
first and are now getting into attacking

83
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,620
security

84
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,940
yeah what were you doing

85
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,019
oh okay yeah you're a natural fit yeah

86
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:23,700
you got it yeah you got some speed

87
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,319
coming your way

88
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,900
um I hired a guy from GE

89
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,420
a little last year year before and now

90
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,159
he's running an apartment

91
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,040
so how you get in from zero and I cannot

92
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,620
emphasize this enough is learn the free

93
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,700
stuff

94
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,580
we live in this wonderful age where all

95
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,019
of this stuff all of this information

96
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,700
that you need to know to work in

97
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,379
security forensics and any of this stuff

98
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,480
is available online and you can get your

99
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,459
hands on it for free even better you can

100
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,680
do things like MIT

101
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,080
Cal State Berkeley we've done audit

102
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,940
courses for free you can take the actual

103
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,159
education components without having to

104
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,500
pay the education cost now you don't get

105
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,540
the piece of paper but it turns out that

106
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,099
piece of paper isn't really worth what

107
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,599
you thought it was anyways it's nice for

108
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,400
your first job oh you have a degree it's

109
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,500
nice for getting past human resources

110
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,080
gateways where the job is like you have

111
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,879
an HR but as we're going to talk about

112
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,680
later you shouldn't be going through the

113
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,600
HR process to get a job anyways because

114
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,798
it's broken

115
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,418
so we don't really care about those

116
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,040
fences and things that you have to jump

117
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,160
over we want to take you around those

118
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,400
because that degree is and who cares

119
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,460
um

120
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,419
we need you to be able to demonstrate

121
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,580
competency we want you to have

122
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,740
certifications but it's not

123
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,720
it's not crucial

124
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,940
um

125
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,560
there's just different ways of going

126
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,080
about it you can obtain learning plans

127
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,180
and guidance for free on how to get into

128
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,240
certain career fields or transition

129
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,620
you don't need to subject yourself to

130
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,800
the education system just to get into a

131
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,560
high performance career field

132
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,259
not that it's necessarily bad these guys

133
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,940
here have some really good programs I

134
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,259
was impressed I was talking to Bill

135
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,000
about some of the requirements I'm like

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,139
hey you guys aren't going to bench out

137
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,120
here some of the other colleges that we

138
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,300
visit I'm like oh God these poor kids

139
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,400
so it's not a bad deal

140
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,040
um the secret path to this stuff though

141
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,840
if you have no idea how to get started

142
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,840
if you don't know for example

143
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,639
how to become a race car driver I have

144
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,320
no idea how I would become a NASCAR race

145
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,840
car driver but the process for breaking

146
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,520
into a field like that is the same no

147
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,020
matter what the field is so if you want

148
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,940
to be

149
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,620
a high profile chemist if you want to

150
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,000
work in industrial controls if you want

151
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,320
to open security forensics blah blah

152
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,979
blah do this stuff and rinse and repeat

153
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,320
find somebody talk to them ask them

154
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,639
questions

155
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,400
this starts to set up a network of

156
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,080
people who are in the career field that

157
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,419
you're interested in and that is very

158
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,880
essential for what we want to accomplish

159
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,139
we're going to talk a lot about

160
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:56,520
networking I'm going to bring that up

161
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,380
again and again and again which is

162
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,639
really annoying because I hate

163
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,620
networking I am the classic narrative

164
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,060
now although I'm standing here speaking

165
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,699
to you right now this is a relatively

166
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:11,699
we're going to evolve Ryan Martin and

167
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,139
we're in my final form

168
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,380
okay uh I I did not used to be like this

169
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,660
I was a classic programmer put me in a

170
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,639
box feed me Pizza under the door and I

171
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,100
will produce magnificent code for you

172
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,199
but it turns out that very few people

173
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,240
appreciate that level of artistry

174
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,160
and they just want to copy and paste

175
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,259
from slash Dot and push it out to

176
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,160
production

177
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,199
so that didn't work out very well that

178
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,300
was a long time ago

179
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,759
but this process here will work very

180
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,319
well for getting you started on the way

181
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,460
because the people are going to give you

182
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,020
input on what you need to do to get

183
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,039
where you want to go because you're

184
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,840
talking to somebody that it worked for

185
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,840
and almost nobody you talk to is going

186
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,460
to come to you and say you need to go

187
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,780
get a degree

188
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,060
I went to University of Maryland I got a

189
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,560
computer science degree that's what you

190
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,780
need to do computer science although you

191
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,400
will hear me complain a lot and say if

192
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,539
you're going to do technology Computer

193
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,580
Sciences

194
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,000
we don't do a lot of that anymore

195
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,039
the other aspect of this that's really

196
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,500
nice is you can ask us questions and we

197
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,759
all want to help there's a human

198
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,919
condition how many people here know what

199
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,979
social engineering is

200
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:17,880
yay okay

201
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,940
we are really good at using social

202
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,979
engineering in Normal

203
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:24,960
activities because we're humans I mean

204
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,419
it's not like somebody invented SE as a

205
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,220
new science or anything it's it's just

206
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,400
normal human behavior that we can then

207
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,080
exploit to get certain goals

208
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,759
accomplished this is no different than

209
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,440
that but when we talk about facilitation

210
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,840
and sales all we're talking about a

211
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,960
certain aspect of SE so not all SE is

212
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,020
bad not all SE is evil but SE is

213
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,400
networking

214
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,319
first and foremost that is networking

215
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,360
and all of the people that you talk to

216
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,460
are vain because we're humans sorry

217
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,280
we're all main characteristic and we all

218
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,259
want to help it's a natural tendency to

219
00:07:58,259 --> 00:07:59,460
want to help each other something that

220
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,960
comes from

221
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,759
the trees I guess when we were all

222
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,160
monkeys but it doesn't take any more

223
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,800
than that to get people to help you move

224
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,419
along the path and figure out what you

225
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,780
need to do

226
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,539
so do you need a degree tldr no

227
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:17,639
they are worth less than experience

228
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,039
they take time and cost money that's two

229
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,539
strikes against the degree that I don't

230
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,900
like they are also poorly targeted as a

231
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,160
third strike so that's three strikes

232
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,840
against degrees right there when we say

233
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,280
poorly targeted what we're talking about

234
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,780
is you come out with a degree and it has

235
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,958
something but that's not like it fits a

236
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,880
job description on indeed

237
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,679
right it doesn't just automatically plug

238
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,599
in like a Lego and go Tada I'm in a

239
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,159
career field

240
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,020
you have to do certain things with it

241
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,020
and if your desired career field is

242
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,240
slightly different like say I want to

243
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,360
work in NASCAR I happen to like racing a

244
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,459
lot like Motors and mechanical things

245
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,339
and I would like to work in that field

246
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:58,380
then I need to tweak what comes out of

247
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,360
college and align it to where I want to

248
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,360
go I have a friend well

249
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,040
yeah I'll discover now I have a friend

250
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,380
that likes Disneyland freaking loves

251
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,060
Disneyland you got a meme in here about

252
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,320
it so it would be good for him to align

253
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,339
his desire to work in security with what

254
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,440
Disney needs any knowledge you have of

255
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,180
the place that you want to go will be

256
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,399
beneficial when you're getting a job

257
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,100
if you see these resumes on indeed and

258
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,740
Linkedin and they're like we're hiring

259
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,480
for this banking position and it pays a

260
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,860
ridiculous amount of money but you need

261
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,899
10 years in banking that's what they're

262
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:34,920
looking for they're looking for people

263
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,420
that know the field already because

264
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,860
there's certain wrinkles to how this

265
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,560
stuff lines up and if you want to work

266
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,300
in that field you need to go get that

267
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,760
experience beforehand because getting it

268
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,380
at the bottom in a lot of fields is very

269
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,339
difficult

270
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:48,959
there's too many of us that have

271
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,940
relatives that need a job that will be

272
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,700
glad to slot them in there

273
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,380
and the big success stories that come

274
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,180
out of college anyways

275
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,980
those guys were doing a lot more than

276
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,959
just getting a degree like if you look

277
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,880
at

278
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,339
people who invented large

279
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,440
applications that are very popular for

280
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,720
social networking right now

281
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,040
um that I don't want to name because I

282
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,500
can't stand it but those guys were doing

283
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,120
things in college besides their degree

284
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,640
they were working their asses off to be

285
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,920
more than just get a college degree

286
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,839
so the big success stories that come out

287
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,700
of it aren't really about the college

288
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,839
they're about the work that they were

289
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,220
doing Bill Gates didn't finish college

290
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,100
in this league dropped out and did um

291
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,459
Visual Basic or whichever basic it was

292
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,800
and then dos and things like that

293
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,700
um

294
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,220
some of the most successful people have

295
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,500
never even completed college it's not a

296
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,060
requirement for this stuff it's a

297
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,519
friendly set of guard rails for us we

298
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,899
can give you a structured environment

299
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:47,940
and get you to learn something and

300
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,920
that's good it's not necessarily a bad

301
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,560
thing but it's also not necessary and

302
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,920
lots of people don't don't go that route

303
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,079
you should do it eventually though I'll

304
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,079
explain a little bit more why

305
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,640
and a dirty secret about college and I

306
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,860
want to drill this in is that you need

307
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,079
to get the businesses to pay for it you

308
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,060
shouldn't be paying for that not only

309
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,860
your student loans suck and debt sucks

310
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,019
but when I pay for it as a business

311
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:16,200
that's like getting a 30 discount

312
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,820
and one of the secrets that I'll talk

313
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,880
about in other talks is that if you are

314
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,680
insisting on getting College like if you

315
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,360
want to go get a legal degree for some

316
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,339
odd reason and you don't feel like

317
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,800
paying 32 000 out of pocket to get that

318
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,140
legal degree you need to build a company

319
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,660
to do that and pay you to go get that

320
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,160
degree because it's like getting a 30

321
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,560
discount that's company money it's

322
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,880
pre-tax

323
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,560
and it gives you an effective discount

324
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,200
rate Plus

325
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,260
uh it's just a good way of doing things

326
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,180
getting the companies the paper now if

327
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,620
it's not your company doing it at my

328
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,540
company you come to me I'm happy to give

329
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,060
you a degree because it's cheaper for me

330
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,300
it gives you more capabilities and it's

331
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,760
pre-tax money and it's just a good thing

332
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,680
keeps you happy as employees so get the

333
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,540
companies to pay for it don't worry so

334
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,880
much about it on your own

335
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,040
foreign

336
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,680
so finding the first job do not restrict

337
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,740
your

338
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,839
searches to The Chosen field you wanted

339
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,880
to be bound and determined to go to work

340
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,680
for Harley-Davidson hold your horses

341
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,640
there

342
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,459
maybe a job at Honda would work out just

343
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,140
your first job is to put bread on the

344
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,060
table you got either student loans to

345
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,620
pay for or you've got a family to pay

346
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,959
for you just have this strong desire to

347
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,120
have food

348
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,620
so you want to

349
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,000
have

350
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,420
a job and your first job matters less

351
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,540
than having a job so get that job get

352
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,420
any job but don't work at Best Buy

353
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,120
don't take help desk jobs these are

354
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,139
things that you can do while you're in

355
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:50,399
college or while you're in high school

356
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,779
or something like that there are

357
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,399
makeshift jobs to get you through

358
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,839
whatever

359
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,180
but things like help desk and user

360
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,920
support these are not places that you

361
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,300
want to wind up with after you graduate

362
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,040
with a college degree they are miserable

363
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,480
hell holes if you've never worked a help

364
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,380
desk

365
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,420
they are terrible

366
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,519
so until we generally want people to not

367
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,839
do that and if you're going to college

368
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,260
and you're getting aligned which we'll

369
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,120
bring up here in a minute you should

370
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,880
have a better plan than going to work

371
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,279
for Best Buy and it's

372
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,139
It's just sad when I see people do that

373
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,420
like why well I want to run a Best Buy

374
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,060
okay that's a legitimate

375
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,040
reason right I want to work with Best

376
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,480
Buy for some reason I love this company

377
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,279
I want to be an executive cool okay

378
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,380
knock yourself out but that's about the

379
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,720
only reason I can think of it

380
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,899
um

381
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,339
another thing that you can do in school

382
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,740
or while you're waiting that I encourage

383
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,100
people to do is go sell go work in

384
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,079
things other than your Tech field go do

385
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,720
things that involve human contact and

386
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,880
work on those soft skills especially

387
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,200
selling because that is a skill set that

388
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,880
will serve you well for the rest of your

389
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,760
life more than C plus plus

390
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,279
I know C plus plus it was great for a

391
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,260
few years never used the sense select

392
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,399
calculus right how many people took

393
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,899
calculus

394
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,220
how many people use calculus

395
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,440
there's always one

396
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,940
um but yeah selling furniture and

397
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,260
picking up your social engineering

398
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,839
skills is a really useful thing to do it

399
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,360
will also open your eyes to a variety of

400
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,740
things and help you with your social

401
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,620
engineering skills

402
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,600
things that you do coming up through the

403
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,120
ranks here should support your field but

404
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,639
they don't necessarily be in your field

405
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,480
so don't get blinders on about where you

406
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,160
need to work and how you need to work or

407
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,220
you wind up not working and the next

408
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,480
thing you know you're at Starbucks

409
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,959
asking me what I want in my luck date

410
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:49,740
okay

411
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,360
uh

412
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,279
Starbucks has a great education plan if

413
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,620
I recall

414
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,880
I don't want to knock them because they

415
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,740
seem to do decent things

416
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,420
but at the same time I don't want to end

417
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,000
up there

418
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,380
taking things and working with them like

419
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,060
this that are complementary to where you

420
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,000
want to be we'll open new doors so if

421
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,500
you are

422
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,740
wanting to get into auto racing and work

423
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,560
in that field as a technologist you can

424
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,660
go work temporarily at something that's

425
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,480
lower on the totem pole like a tire shop

426
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,040
or an oil change shop or something like

427
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,199
that and you can start building your

428
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,760
contacts and you can start understanding

429
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,980
the industry more those are things that

430
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,019
facilitate your eventual goal so they

431
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:34,459
are not necessarily a bad deal

432
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,800
construction for example you can work in

433
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,899
construction and make decent coins while

434
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,459
you're going through school or what have

435
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:42,899
you or while you're trying to find a

436
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,240
better job and if you want to work in

437
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,740
the technology aspects of construction

438
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,019
there's some huge stuff going on there

439
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,820
there's all sorts of forensics things

440
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,260
with construction there's all sorts of

441
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,399
Technology things with construction

442
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,079
we're doing amazing things with drones

443
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,019
now we've got fancy lasercraft that just

444
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,820
does all kinds of stuff

445
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,440
um and the 3D printing thing that's

446
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,959
coming along it's really neat

447
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,959
so don't limit your search to what you

448
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,720
think is appropriate spend some time

449
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,040
pondering it and talk to people

450
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:16,770
hey

451
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,019
[Music]

452
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,600
technology is hard

453
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,459
there we go all right so the standard

454
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,440
career progression for people in our

455
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,420
business

456
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,040
we typically start off on the low end

457
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,199
when we come out with a college degree

458
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,839
we are a programmer we are a network

459
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,440
Tech we are a systems Tech

460
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,420
like I said things like PC tech that

461
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,279
shouldn't be post-grad stuff that should

462
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,620
be I need a job and I need to go do

463
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,920
something it's a holdover but you start

464
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,500
off at some sort of low entry level

465
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,959
field in the technology aspect of it and

466
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,940
you get better and if you're smart

467
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,160
you're persuading your employer to give

468
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,100
you certifications like when I ran the

469
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,220
PC shop at huntel we would take people

470
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,420
in and like I know how to use a

471
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,740
screwdriver and I'm like great which end

472
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,059
is the appropriate then and as long as

473
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,439
they could manage that we would train

474
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,599
them into the tech field and then the

475
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,240
manufacturers like Fujitsu would give us

476
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,939
class credits to send them to classes to

477
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,799
train them on how to disassemble laptops

478
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,760
and things like that and put it together

479
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,439
I don't know if Best Buy does that now

480
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,900
and the wonderful thing about modern

481
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,540
Technologies it's gotten so easy aside

482
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,020
from Max

483
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,240
[Music]

484
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,980
it's not terribly hard to work on this

485
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,500
stuff

486
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,900
but you become a subject specialist we

487
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,179
want you to learn more and become better

488
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:37,740
at it so that we can charge more money

489
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,059
and so that you can do more things

490
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,400
because we're leveling up your

491
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,039
capabilities and your employer should be

492
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,320
paying for this but the other sign there

493
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,940
is that you can get most of this stuff

494
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,760
for free on the internet and if you are

495
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,200
not happy with where you are and you

496
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,760
want to be somewhere else

497
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,039
figure out a plan and start learning

498
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:58,440
those technology courses we can get our

499
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,960
hands on so much stuff right now in

500
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,760
addition to the education aspects the

501
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,400
actual physical stuff if you work as a

502
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,900
computer programmer and you would like

503
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,880
to work in operational technology red

504
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,039
teaming you can order that equipment off

505
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,380
of eBay for like 50 bucks it's not

506
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,780
expensive so what's stopping you from

507
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,880
doing what you want to do

508
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,919
there are limitations on how you bounce

509
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,900
around in the career fields and the

510
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,880
alignments here like for example a ciso

511
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,980
is probably never going to be a CBO

512
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,600
unless they start their own company

513
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,880
because they don't have the business and

514
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,200
financial chops coming up as a ciso

515
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,039
to make that transition but as a CEO or

516
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,440
a CFO does they're embedded in it so

517
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,640
there are

518
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,679
consequences to the paths that you

519
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,600
choose you just need to be aware of them

520
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,580
as they go but that's way down the thing

521
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,260
um then there's entrepreneurs beeps and

522
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,660
Consulting we routinely in our career

523
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,880
Fields uh security and forensics bounce

524
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,820
back and forth between Consulting

525
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,980
and regular work after you work

526
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,120
it's sort of a way to hold yourself

527
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,799
while you're finding a new job

528
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,360
on the other hand I've been doing

529
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,340
consultant for a long time now and I

530
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,419
just do consulting which is I love it

531
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:13,740
all right and you become a security

532
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,900
analyst and supervisor and so on when

533
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,520
you level up the management chain though

534
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,480
and this is where you have to be

535
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,980
cautious you have to make a conscious

536
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,780
Choice do I want to be an engineer or do

537
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,460
I want to be in business and management

538
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,179
because once you make that transition

539
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,880
you are going to start rusting

540
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,400
unless you put in some significant

541
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,460
effort to maintain skills on your own

542
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,620
and once that happens going back if you

543
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,419
fail miserably at management which you

544
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:40,559
should never do because it's not like

545
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,760
it's hard we all know managers are hard

546
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,600
um

547
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,000
if you have to go back into engineering

548
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,380
it can be difficult

549
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,720
I made a transition back during one of

550
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,940
the windows evolutions and came back to

551
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,740
find out that the entire server

552
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,660
architecture and the back end system had

553
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,360
mutated into one of the middleware

554
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,520
aspects of Microsoft back in the 90s and

555
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,620
I was just like what happened I'm going

556
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,440
back to Unix for this

557
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,480
um because Unix is UNIX that hasn't

558
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,340
changed and I mean it has but not really

559
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,280
wonderful stuff anyways this is how you

560
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,320
lever up and um

561
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,700
like I said if you're going to be in

562
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,220
management you're making certain choices

563
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,419
and you need to be aware of the

564
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,960
consequences

565
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,260
getting it above zero uh if you are

566
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,419
trying to get into the field if you are

567
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:32,280
coming back into initial networking

568
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,260
opportunities we want you to find

569
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,059
someone that's doing what you want to be

570
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:39,419
doing use the three question thing get

571
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:40,860
some social engineering action going

572
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,480
there and find out what it is they can

573
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,480
do a trick to dealing with people like

574
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,660
me that talk too much is to stand up

575
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,160
maybe taught us this in the military

576
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,080
because we had to sit through lectures

577
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,640
and it was extremely boring and I

578
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,740
realized I'm lecturing sorry but there's

579
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,120
a lot of material in trying to cram into

580
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,400
your heads if you stand up it will help

581
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,600
with absorption and keep you from

582
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,860
falling asleep

583
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,939
I just encourage you

584
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,020
cross training is also much easier than

585
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,940
a clean break if you were working in

586
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,320
construction and you wanted to go work

587
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,419
in Tech your knowledge in the

588
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,580
construction field is useful leverage

589
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,500
for getting into Tech aspects of the

590
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,740
construction field so again this is once

591
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,720
you pick a field we want you to be happy

592
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,460
with it so make sure it's something that

593
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,539
you want to do because you're going to

594
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:28,380
invest in it and enough time to learn it

595
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,299
it's going to be someone that sticks

596
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,400
with you for the next 20 years we want

597
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,559
you to keep doing that vertical and

598
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,000
preserve that knowledge because if you

599
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,380
have to flush that and start over in

600
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,020
another vertical it's going to be

601
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,580
it's going to be difficult

602
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,100
now the flip side to that is that if

603
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,080
you're working in Tech and the other

604
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,820
industry has Tech you can still make the

605
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,740
transition the C plus program is a c

606
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,179
plus programmer no matter what vertical

607
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,520
they're in right except that there's

608
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,960
certain wrinkles they'll understand but

609
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,179
you're still just a simplest program no

610
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,419
worries

611
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,080
um

612
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,640
the job markets uh are important

613
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,080
considerations for what you're up

614
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,140
against here the cities are easier to

615
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,059
find jobs in there's a ton of jobs

616
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:13,740
available in New York there's a ton of

617
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,080
jobs available in Philadelphia they pay

618
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,919
more the cost of living is disgusting

619
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,559
if you like City life that's a great way

620
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,360
to go if you don't like City Life it's

621
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,700
horrible

622
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,559
remote is now a more valid option than

623
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,880
it used to be

624
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,580
especially with Consultants but still

625
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,980
less so especially they're all trying to

626
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,480
get us back in the office in a lot of

627
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,700
places especially the cities

628
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,280
and if you want to work remote and if

629
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,260
that is an option they will use that

630
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,539
against you they will tell you you need

631
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,220
to work for less money

632
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,780
you're like well why it's still doing

633
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,600
the same job yeah but you're in Omaha

634
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,980
and because you like it there we're

635
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,559
going to pay you less money

636
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,659
that's bargaining

637
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,900
uh Network outside of your comfort zone

638
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,880
if you think you have limits on what

639
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,200
you're doing if it feels like you're

640
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,880
banging up against limitations because

641
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,799
of either your career field choices or

642
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,500
your technology choices

643
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,659
reach out outside of the field

644
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:15,240
talk to somebody that runs a bakery talk

645
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,100
to somebody that runs a furniture

646
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,559
manufacturing Place learn more stuff

647
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,940
even if it's not in your career field

648
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,600
the more stuff that you know the more

649
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,700
flexible your thinking will be

650
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,140
and you never know when you come up

651
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,299
against a weird opportunity in some ways

652
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:32,460
because all of these manufacturers use

653
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,100
the same OT technology it's all the same

654
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,760
stuff so you can work in any of them

655
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,280
get out of your comfort zone and in line

656
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,720
with that is that if you spend too much

657
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,059
time in one place we used to have this

658
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,740
thing like I work for IBM for 40 years

659
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,960
and retired Nobody Does that anymore if

660
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,460
they're spending any amount of

661
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,640
significant time in a business it may be

662
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,740
hurting them in addition to you not

663
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,299
getting the raises that you're entitled

664
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:58,679
to they'll be bringing in new people and

665
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,059
paying them more than they give you your

666
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,460
animal weight on you will raise for so

667
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,020
you're going to feel like I'm getting

668
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,419
jipped here I'm doing more work than

669
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,340
this guy but I'm getting less money

670
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,260
that's not fair so you have to

671
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,140
transition in technology to maintain the

672
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,419
current standard of pay which is weird

673
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:18,200
but okay

674
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,280
um the other problem with it is that you

675
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,200
get embedded and you think that there's

676
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,820
only one way of doing things if you go

677
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,260
to work for a hospital a healthcare

678
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,000
organization this is

679
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,380
very common

680
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,440
you have a very limited understanding of

681
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,720
how business works and a very limited

682
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,539
understanding of how technology works

683
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,880
because you're living in a small pond

684
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,740
and you have got to get outside of that

685
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,679
to be able to expand your thinking to

686
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,539
understand what else there is available

687
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:47,460
we try and do that with training right

688
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,980
we want your manager to send you to Sans

689
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,539
courses so that you can learn more about

690
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:54,240
security for programming or whatever

691
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,100
and bring it back to the organization

692
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,620
and be better at it but the reality is

693
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,640
that it never works that way we try but

694
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,100
nothing beats bringing in fresh blood

695
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,400
fresh blood always has different ideas

696
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,400
go consult it will definitely change

697
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,260
your understanding of how business works

698
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,760
and how the world works we'll do a

699
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,620
startup that will change you as a human

700
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,580
being

701
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,159
until you've worked 80 hour weeks for

702
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,960
more than 40 weeks at a time you just

703
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,400
don't understand what startup life is

704
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,299
like

705
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:27,000
and it's brutal but supposedly the pants

706
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,400
great you're not the one getting that

707
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,539
pout

708
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,640
The Venture capitalists are that's

709
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,900
another lesson that you need to learn

710
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,000
all right more career management things

711
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,460
to do on your own or with uh additional

712
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,940
pay from your company is go to seminars

713
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,380
you'll learn this stuff professional

714
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,480
success is this never-ending treadmill

715
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,419
of effort we have to continuously

716
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,520
improve the only other profession that's

717
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,679
like technology in this regard is

718
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,020
medicine they are the only other people

719
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,659
I have seen that work the same sort of

720
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,940
hours we do the same intensity and still

721
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,740
have to do the same level of learning

722
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,659
and when you think about that if you're

723
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:08,400
working just as hard as a doctor there's

724
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,960
a reason why we want to pay you just as

725
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,100
well as a doctor

726
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,860
but you've got to exhibit that level of

727
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,059
performance doctors can't make mistakes

728
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,220
we have to keep learning to stay on top

729
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,080
of stuff

730
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,080
I work a ridiculous amount of time

731
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,240
but it's all worth it because in five

732
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,340
years my startup will be doing what I

733
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,320
wanted to do and then we'll be out exit

734
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,799
strategy

735
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,559
um

736
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,500
when we talk about social engineering

737
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,600
and career Management in addition to the

738
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,700
SE part there we're not talking about

739
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,320
the bad sides of it we're talking about

740
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,659
the good sides the networking stuff is

741
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:51,240
one aspect of it but we're also trying

742
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,740
in our

743
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,659
networking efforts to reach out to

744
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:55,980
people who may not be interested in

745
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,320
talking to us and the way that you get

746
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,620
them interested is by doing anybody lots

747
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,820
of social engineering what do we do to

748
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,679
get people's interests

749
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,260
begins with a p

750
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,158
just shout it out

751
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,460
yes

752
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,559
retesting we do pre-texting all the time

753
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,779
anyways sometimes it's evil sometimes

754
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:18,860
it's not don't be evil

755
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,080
professional associations and

756
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,179
certifications of note these are things

757
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:26,220
that you can do to get you more help in

758
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,500
the career field they have again limited

759
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,679
value limited lifespan

760
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:32,400
um

761
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,200
and they should align to where you want

762
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,279
to go

763
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,960
if

764
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,299
if you want to work in racing go get

765
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,520
racing stuff go talk to various

766
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,240
manufacturers

767
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,020
reputation development this is where

768
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,539
things get sort of interesting for fast

769
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,419
progression and making gains in ways

770
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:56,220
that most of your co-workers will not do

771
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,640
because it takes effort and attention

772
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,740
research and Analysis for work if I give

773
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,240
you a project as your manager and you

774
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,179
have to go learn something new there is

775
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:07,980
absolutely no reason for you not to

776
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,440
write a blog post about it that brings

777
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,600
up your personal brand

778
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,400
if you have a bunch of blog posts and

779
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,440
you go in for a job and you have a

780
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,020
reputation you do talks and cons

781
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,539
you're going to be more attractive to an

782
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:24,600
employer than somebody who is just a

783
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,279
cube Warrior and sits in the cube and

784
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,080
doesn't do any of that because we need

785
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,059
you to have certain skills and this is

786
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:31,740
the kind of stuff that demonstrates to

787
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,200
them before they hire you that you can

788
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,380
write if you can manage processes that

789
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,900
you can achieve goals that you can do

790
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,779
things that will help make sure that

791
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:44,940
you're a good fit for the job

792
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,980
so think of this as like an extended

793
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,140
resume

794
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,080
um some of it can earn you money I'm not

795
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,940
the I'm not going to ever tell people

796
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,740
yeah you need to run a Blog and monetize

797
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,419
it and that's how you made it yeah no

798
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:59,100
that doesn't work

799
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,520
um but it will help you get things done

800
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,340
that will get you the next job

801
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,760
it also helps you develop a side gig if

802
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,440
you are working towards a certain goal

803
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,779
in certain things this is another way to

804
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:14,700
align where you want to go with what

805
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,779
you're doing now

806
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:17,700
but uh it all improves your

807
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,100
communication skills and the progression

808
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,600
here is

809
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,640
to be pretty easy to see

810
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,899
um eventually it becomes a book

811
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:27,419
something like that but don't hyper

812
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:29,100
focus on this some of the people that

813
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,380
find out how to use this for career

814
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,380
management get stuck in this and they

815
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,179
start thinking that writing blogs and

816
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,000
Publishing books is a great way to go

817
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,480
and they're useless as workers because

818
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,340
they think that this is their priority

819
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,380
and your priority is to do what I want

820
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,020
you to do or what the employer wants you

821
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,179
to do we don't care about your blogs and

822
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:52,500
your articles and your books and

823
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,120
speaking at cons unless it directly

824
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,980
aligns with what we want because it's

825
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,500
that's how business works

826
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,520
so don't get caught up in it

827
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,340
[Music]

828
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,320
uh I'm pressing with all the technical

829
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,860
seminars

830
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,360
the big thing here is to take the

831
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,039
technical seminars for the fields that

832
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,559
you want to get into and go get those so

833
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,120
that you're you're Paving the way for

834
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,919
you to get to where you want to be

835
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:19,679
some of the better known stuff from

836
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,779
older Generations that has not carried

837
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,399
through is things like Dale Carnegie

838
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:25,799
what what nobody likes to talk about is

839
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,000
the fact that we figured out all the

840
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,039
answers to all of this stuff decades ago

841
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,779
if you want to talk about how to manage

842
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:32,220
computer systems and business and

843
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,779
technology and forensics and things like

844
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,179
that all of the processes we figured

845
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:39,059
that stuff out back in the 70s and IBM

846
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:41,220
ironically was largely responsible for a

847
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,539
great deal of it and it all got

848
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,100
documented and it's all out there and

849
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,020
available for you you have to go find it

850
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,340
and read it

851
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,080
but we don't

852
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,419
teach it in a way that makes it readily

853
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:52,740
available to you so you end up

854
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,080
Reinventing the wheel we don't want that

855
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,360
to happen it's a waste of time so I

856
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,220
always encourage people go take these

857
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,260
things people like Dale Carnegie and

858
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,700
other business management people that

859
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,899
have been doing this for 30 years

860
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:05,940
there's a reason why they're good at it

861
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,440
go take advantage of that

862
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:13,559
there's my boy with the Disney

863
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,559
so you can try and work in network

864
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,120
engineering or work in security and

865
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,679
whatnot but if you if you really dig

866
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,960
Disney and I cannot emphasize enough how

867
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,120
much Chris

868
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,919
likes Disney

869
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,340
uh this is a great way to get there go

870
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,720
work in network engineering at

871
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,340
Disneyland

872
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,779
he would get to see all of the back

873
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:35,640
stuff the stuff that's going on behind

874
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,430
the scenes

875
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,559
[Music]

876
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,000
instead he works for an insurance

877
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,299
company

878
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,440
so Follow Your Passion lay the

879
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,000
groundwork enhance your networking

880
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,039
pre-build that Network

881
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:51,000
and then by all means save your money

882
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,620
because you never know when the Market's

883
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,539
going to crush out none of you guys here

884
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,700
were on the California coast or the

885
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,100
startup mess I don't think anybody

886
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,380
anybody have to suffer through 40 000

887
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,600
person layoffs

888
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,840
okay so in the past and in the very

889
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,120
recent past for a few of us there were

890
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,679
massive layoffs in the tech industry

891
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,140
because the between the VC world and

892
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,240
Technology

893
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,799
things can change rapidly and large

894
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,799
amounts of your competitor co-workers

895
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:22,260
find themselves out of work when

896
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,059
Hewlett-Packard and Compact and

897
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:25,380
different computer places like that

898
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,539
would retool their architectures in the

899
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,340
past they would lay off the entire

900
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,380
Workforce so when they went from the 486

901
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,659
to the Pentium they just wiped out the

902
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:35,340
entire field in the Silicon Valley and

903
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,679
like 20 000 Engineers were gone

904
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,419
now that we're going to bring them back

905
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:41,100
eventually once they got the tooling we

906
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,539
established for the Next Generation

907
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:44,279
Pentium but in the meantime those guys

908
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:45,419
don't have a job

909
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:48,120
and that can be a little rough on you

910
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,559
so save your money

911
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,960
you want to start looking for your next

912
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,000
job well before you need it you don't

913
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,799
have to take it right you could like

914
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,240
where you're at it could be working out

915
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,500
really well for you so you don't have to

916
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,880
take it but make sure you keep those

917
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,440
options in your pocket and know where

918
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,539
you're going to be next or know what

919
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:08,940
your opportunities are because if you

920
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,440
were working in Silicon Valley in the

921
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,179
last year

922
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:14,039
you could have had the legs kicked out

923
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:15,419
from under you and that's not like HP

924
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:16,740
where those jobs are coming back those

925
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,860
guys lost their jobs and it's gone and

926
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,299
it's not coming back

927
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,100
and there's a lot of tech people now on

928
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,320
the market that are now competing with

929
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,700
each other for a job that they weren't

930
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,799
ready to go find

931
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,480
luckily they have good skills so they

932
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,899
probably won't be too bad

933
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:35,279
secondary skills are a wonderful thing

934
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,200
again this pays plays into how your

935
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,299
secondary business considerations and

936
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:44,100
how you manage your personal life can

937
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,200
benefit your professional life if you

938
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,640
are enjoying something to work in that

939
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,440
field but you can also do things like

940
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,980
start a side business and use that to

941
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,260
save money if you like to travel but you

942
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,539
don't work in a business like Consulting

943
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:58,799
where you get to travel all the time

944
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,659
have a business

945
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,340
we talked about travel I mean it could

946
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,899
be as literally as simple as look I have

947
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:06,000
a Blog and we talk about travel how do

948
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,320
you think all those people started that

949
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,159
crap

950
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,280
because it's anyone can do it it's not

951
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,020
special all you have to do is go guess

952
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,020
what I work in candy manufacturing

953
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,980
congratulations now you have a business

954
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,080
you can go actually formalize the

955
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,760
business get customers and income and

956
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,980
all of that but as long as you were

957
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,219
demonstrating some effort at making it

958
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,918
business-like like having a Blog talking

959
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:31,139
to people writing articles about it

960
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,000
you can then go

961
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,760
buy a bunch of candy or look at candy

962
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,739
manufacturing or go on tours and Candy

963
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,260
facilities come to Hershey Pennsylvania

964
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,719
they love to give tours great stuff go

965
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,000
to Denmark and look at how really good

966
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,940
chocolate is manufactured and all of

967
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,520
that is a business expense now and

968
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,520
deductible from any earnings that you

969
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,679
make from the business you can't take

970
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,560
your salary from your FTE position and

971
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,359
deduct that against it but you can't

972
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:02,220
carry through a loss in certain ways it

973
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,420
gets complicated there's a whole other

974
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,220
presentation on this stuff so we won't

975
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,920
go there but use what you like to better

976
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,839
your position in life and if it happens

977
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,820
to take care of your FTE position or

978
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,220
your job by all means maximize that

979
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,140
stuff

980
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,020
um I sponsor NASCAR races

981
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,359
little tiny stickers not big stickers

982
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,680
because like I said we don't make a lot

983
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,420
of money but that gets me certain things

984
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,980
that I want

985
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,440
um and it's right off I can fly us out

986
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,180
to Indiana and go attend the firecracker

987
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,220
500 or whatnot it's all business expense

988
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,240
which is like an immediate 30 discount

989
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,799
immediate boom can't beat it

990
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,500
all right so networking and why this is

991
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,940
so important and this is what a lot of

992
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,099
people don't understand a lot of people

993
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:49,260
never internalize these Concepts at all

994
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,720
in life you only have so much time you

995
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,119
only have so much emotional content that

996
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,160
you can share with other people and some

997
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,359
people figure this out in different ways

998
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,500
and they're like look I just can't deal

999
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,300
right now that's because you're out of

1000
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,480
space you're out of a way to deal with

1001
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,740
whatever it is that you're looking at in

1002
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,440
terms of other people but you have three

1003
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,780
zones in your life you have people to

1004
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,640
you that are emotionally beneficial like

1005
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,619
your family you have people to you that

1006
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:15,119
are socially beneficial like your

1007
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,740
friends and you have people that are

1008
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,079
professionally beneficial and you only

1009
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,480
have so much time and you don't have a

1010
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,040
choice about the family

1011
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,020
so that one right there sucks up a bunch

1012
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,020
of time and it can be a little strange

1013
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,240
at times you also have the little red

1014
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,980
dots which are people that would

1015
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,420
normally fall into one of those circles

1016
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,540
but I have no redeeming benefit at all

1017
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,560
but you're still stuck with them

1018
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,000
there's a bunch of different ways that

1019
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,680
can happen but you have to deal with

1020
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,599
them you don't have a choice and it's

1021
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,180
not helping you it's actually it's

1022
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,980
difficult to deal with some of us have

1023
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,780
very difficult situations in our lives

1024
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,940
and that can be tough but it takes up

1025
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,339
some of this time that you're using to

1026
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,500
deal with networking it's all a form of

1027
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,780
networking

1028
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,760
um not over my overtime

1029
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,619
no okay

1030
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:06,780
so you can fit more people into

1031
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,839
different circles family you can

1032
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,820
generally only fit like five people in

1033
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,260
there seriously you get your mom your

1034
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,359
dad your kids that's about the limits of

1035
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,500
what you get and you get some

1036
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,900
grandparents maybe but it's very small

1037
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,460
circle of people that you are willing to

1038
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,859
commit to that level you're socially

1039
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:25,020
beneficial your friends some of us think

1040
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,280
we have a lot of friends but you really

1041
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,160
don't if they won't give you money not

1042
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,640
alone give you money if they want

1043
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,280
screw up a portion of their day to come

1044
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,780
help you they're not really friends

1045
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,579
they're acquaintances of their best

1046
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:44,520
I have 150 Facebook friends

1047
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,280
but they're not all friends and we have

1048
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,859
small numbers really that committed to

1049
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:52,859
my successes in the individual but

1050
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:55,140
there's a sizable amount it might be

1051
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,359
five it might be ten but the thing is if

1052
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,760
I make it 10 and I give that amount of

1053
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,560
time to it I have to pull numbers from

1054
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,579
somewhere else

1055
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:04,619
so you have to make decisions about

1056
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:06,960
managing your career and managing your

1057
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,420
life that impact how these numbers flow

1058
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,940
and change and on the professional side

1059
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,560
you can bump that number up to like 20

1060
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,599
you can have about 20 people which if

1061
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,339
you work in sales

1062
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,020
um for any length of time will come in

1063
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,260
as a fun feature number 20 is like the

1064
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,180
optimal place for people that you want

1065
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,480
to commit to in the sales life

1066
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,859
they will always help you out in the

1067
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:30,660
sales cycle and they're good for

1068
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,040
optimization

1069
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,800
but it if you want to have 30 people in

1070
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,420
professional you got to pick one of

1071
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,339
those other circles and cut it you don't

1072
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:39,660
have a choice because you only have so

1073
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,460
much time so understanding how this

1074
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,500
stuff balances out and what takes what

1075
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,300
sort of context is very important

1076
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,520
networking is essential if you aren't

1077
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,859
good get better I was terrible at it I

1078
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:00,480
still am terrible at it I'm better than

1079
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,359
I was but come on it's some for some of

1080
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,040
us it's difficult for some of us it's

1081
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,980
easy they're Naturals if you've ever

1082
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,960
worked in this the SC world for anything

1083
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,760
from any length of time you know people

1084
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,000
that are Naturals at se and they're

1085
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,940
they're typically horrible people

1086
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,020
because they've been using it their

1087
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,820
whole lives to get what they want but

1088
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,900
there's also people that are just better

1089
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,599
at it

1090
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,740
these this is all just another skill

1091
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,880
that you can learn anybody who's

1092
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,460
terrible at it even can learn it over

1093
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,040
time it just takes effort

1094
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,260
uh ask for help

1095
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,880
it's just another thing to improve it's

1096
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,839
another skill you can learn

1097
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,079
an easy way to get to Pro level

1098
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:44,579
networking

1099
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:48,839
um is to take this piece from the

1100
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:50,280
networking aspects of LinkedIn and

1101
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,140
Google and so on and ask these questions

1102
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,060
these are the three questions that we

1103
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,800
want to ask

1104
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,020
um not

1105
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,400
sorry

1106
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,500
these are three questions that you can

1107
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,359
ask that will help you get to where you

1108
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,240
want to be in the communications fund

1109
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,520
talk to people at the companies that you

1110
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,800
want to work at even if they're not the

1111
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,099
hiring manager when we do sales stuff we

1112
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:15,599
can't necessarily pick up the phone and

1113
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,160
talk to the CEO we have to start

1114
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,320
somewhere in the organization and I now

1115
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,880
have to take one of those slots from my

1116
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,099
circle and say yes you as the engineer

1117
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:24,780
in this company are now part of the

1118
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,640
circle and I can't just dump them

1119
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,040
because then I have a bad reputation

1120
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,500
whether there's a cost to this stuff you

1121
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,940
need to be aware of it

1122
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,160
you can use cold LinkedIn approaches I

1123
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,140
wanted to link so that I could ask you

1124
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,520
about X

1125
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,440
that they would be willing to talk about

1126
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,140
like you may not think that you can ask

1127
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,300
Bill Gates a question but I guarantee

1128
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,980
you that there's a way that we can

1129
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,780
manipulate the situation so that Bill

1130
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,640
Gates will answer your question and

1131
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,200
those of us in

1132
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,780
this particular subset of the field love

1133
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,420
to do this and then post pictures of had

1134
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,940
Markham not Mark Hamill Mark Cuban like

1135
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,520
my my poster my tweet or whatever

1136
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,560
it's done

1137
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,260
uh you can build an entire topic alarm

1138
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,599
on LinkedIn like this from scratch and

1139
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,820
get all sorts of information to inject

1140
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,500
into your career path that will help you

1141
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,599
just by following this sort of stuff ask

1142
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,119
for help we all want to help we all want

1143
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:19,859
to be helpful

1144
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:22,320
some of us don't have time sometime we

1145
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,579
still win

1146
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:25,680
okay cautions with groups as links

1147
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,060
there's groups out there that want to

1148
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,859
help you network we want to help you we

1149
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:30,839
want to make you better we want to all

1150
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:33,000
you have to do is give us some money

1151
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,640
we'll avoid those guys like to play if

1152
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,280
anybody in a networking organization is

1153
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,960
asking you for money if they're trying

1154
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,480
to sell you stuff it just feels skeevy

1155
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,119
just get out they're just scum they

1156
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,380
probably want to sell you Amway or

1157
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,000
something like that

1158
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,760
um it's not a good thing to be in and

1159
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,040
there's a ton of them out there and some

1160
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,020
of them claim to be really good in their

1161
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,579
National brands or their International

1162
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:58,200
Brands

1163
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,280
um

1164
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,380
but like there's there's a good company

1165
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,020
called Toastmasters which we get in the

1166
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,640
military we make toasts a lot in the

1167
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,980
military for some reason and this is a

1168
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,720
great public speaking Forum because they

1169
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,700
teach you public speaking you have to go

1170
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,320
up and give presentations and stuff like

1171
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,640
that and that's part of Toastmasters

1172
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,900
doesn't cost you anything although they

1173
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,280
might want chapter membership so that

1174
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,720
they can pay for coffee at the meetings

1175
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,220
or something like that they don't charge

1176
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:23,760
you 500 annually or something cpang is

1177
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,680
like 50 bucks annually it's really small

1178
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,260
it covers annual meetings dues things

1179
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,240
like that it's well worth the money but

1180
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,240
it's also very small cpang is Northern

1181
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,640
Pennsylvania and Jersey places like that

1182
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,320
so it doesn't work down here but you've

1183
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,880
got something here I guarantee it and

1184
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,960
then there's always the Chamber of

1185
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,579
Commerce another great place to network

1186
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,060
okay job hunts

1187
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,520
why do you want to work there if you

1188
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,740
cannot answer this question adequately

1189
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,420
you probably shouldn't be looking for

1190
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,520
work there you need to understand why

1191
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,020
you want and the answer is because of

1192
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,880
the money I got bad news for you you're

1193
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,480
not going to be happy

1194
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,160
if your answers don't justify the effort

1195
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,099
you're going to get frustrated

1196
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:11,220
um that Inc magazine article talks a

1197
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,839
little bit more about it and that's I

1198
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:13,980
threw this slide up there because of

1199
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,260
that because you need to understand why

1200
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,520
you're interested in going where you're

1201
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,960
going

1202
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,180
I joined the military because I wanted

1203
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,680
to see the world and do fun things like

1204
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,660
that and have them pay for my college I

1205
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,040
knew what I was getting into and made

1206
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,079
the decision consciously

1207
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,940
um understand what you're getting into

1208
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,280
with this stuff

1209
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,599
do what you want to be doing and

1210
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,520
understand why and things will work out

1211
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,720
because you'll be willing to put the

1212
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,200
effort in

1213
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,220
we're almost done forms of business pay

1214
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,720
attention to forms of business just like

1215
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,420
military just like vertical markets if

1216
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,040
you know more about health care you're

1217
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,119
probably going to be able to get a job

1218
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,099
in a healthcare related field easier

1219
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:55,800
than you will banking if you work in

1220
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,540
government military you're going to get

1221
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,500
a job easier in federal service than you

1222
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,540
will going to work for a pure capitalist

1223
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,420
New York firm

1224
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,500
bureaucracies or bureaucracies they have

1225
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,420
different ways of doing business family

1226
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,339
owns all of these things there's

1227
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:13,500
different rules that go into how the

1228
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,940
businesses are run and if you're not

1229
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,099
comfortable with one some people cannot

1230
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:19,260
stand family organizations

1231
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,079
because there's a lot of nepotism

1232
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,180
family comes first that vice president

1233
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,980
promotion is always going to go to

1234
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,839
Junior rather than you unless he's a

1235
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,619
real screw up so you have to understand

1236
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:32,640
there might be some problems there and

1237
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,640
make sure you're comfortable with it

1238
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,680
continuing education again let the

1239
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,420
employer pay for your degree forklift

1240
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,520
qualified yes

1241
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,220
beware of too many degrees it's fun to

1242
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,359
collect degrees

1243
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,339
especially if your employer will pay for

1244
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:49,680
them and you have a desire to learn like

1245
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,260
I do and you want to collect degrees

1246
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,839
however collecting BS degrees is fine

1247
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:57,599
collecting undergrad degrees is fine you

1248
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,520
don't put them all in your resume

1249
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,980
but the minute you go to PhD

1250
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,800
or Masters you are elevating yourself

1251
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,020
outside of a pool of potential employees

1252
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,000
and you may get to the point where you

1253
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,119
want to not list this on your resume or

1254
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:13,500
you don't want to use it as part of the

1255
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,720
job hunt because it will limit you I

1256
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,119
know a couple people who have phds and

1257
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:19,500
they cannot find work to save their

1258
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,960
souls even when they're not looking at

1259
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,160
that level

1260
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,560
so be careful with phds unless you're

1261
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,119
going to work in that field if you're

1262
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,380
going to go be a research scientist

1263
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,880
someplace then that's what you have to

1264
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,020
have and it makes perfect sense

1265
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,799
oops

1266
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,819
focused learning have a plan

1267
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:43,200
make sure you know where you're going

1268
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,900
talk to people get input um when we're

1269
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,760
doing job sums and stuff it can be very

1270
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,180
difficult because we're out of work or

1271
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,740
because we're trying desperately to find

1272
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,060
work because we're unhappy for whatever

1273
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,319
reason it can cause you mental pain when

1274
00:45:58,319 --> 00:45:59,339
you're having to go through this stuff

1275
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,260
so get input from friends family people

1276
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,520
that are willing to give you more

1277
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,440
information like people in your Social

1278
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,760
Engineering Process where you're trying

1279
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,180
to ask for their advice now

1280
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,819
most people in any field can obtain

1281
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:14,520
suitable skills for transition in under

1282
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,900
20 days

1283
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,240
so why did we make you go to school for

1284
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,579
four years if we can do this in 20 days

1285
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:22,200
why on Earth did we put you through all

1286
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,760
that well General stuff is really good

1287
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,099
there's other reasons for it but if you

1288
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:29,160
want to change from forensics to

1289
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,920
chemistry something that drastic you can

1290
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,240
actually make that transaction

1291
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,640
transition in about 20 days

1292
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,500
total um

1293
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,640
160 hours

1294
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,319
you won't be like a super great chemist

1295
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:45,300
but you'll be able to get a job

1296
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,880
if you want to work in in construction

1297
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,980
auto mechanics what have you it doesn't

1298
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,839
take much to make that transition that

1299
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,880
transition

1300
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,819
and you can become a respected expert in

1301
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:59,280
the field in under two years

1302
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,260
100 guaranteed I've seen this happen

1303
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,720
more times than I care to admit dude was

1304
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,640
an accountant decided he was going to

1305
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,859
work in computer forensics busted his

1306
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:10,500
butt for two years and became a

1307
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,180
respected computer forensics person that

1308
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,339
talked to national conferences there's a

1309
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:16,619
methodology to it Carnegie Mellon not

1310
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:18,780
Carnegie Mellon Dale Carnegie that's

1311
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,220
where the Carnegie name comes from

1312
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,839
Carnegie Mellon Imperial party

1313
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,880
you can you can do amazing things in a

1314
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,560
short period of time

1315
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,619
it just doesn't seem that way at first

1316
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:33,119
retiring getting out always have your

1317
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,380
exit strategy know where you're supposed

1318
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,300
to be in a short period of time in a

1319
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,040
long period of time the medium you've

1320
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,839
got to have these goals lined up if you

1321
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,359
can't retire in 20 years you are doing

1322
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,800
something wrong

1323
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,599
20-year retirement is possible for

1324
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,819
everybody as long as you have planned

1325
00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:49,260
correctly the problem is that we're

1326
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,880
humans and some of us can't plan for

1327
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,119
beans because we're scatterbrained and

1328
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:55,800
that's what bogs us down so that's why

1329
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,599
you need a plan that's why you need to

1330
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,400
know where you're going and have set

1331
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,339
what your goals are and if you're doing

1332
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:03,540
something wrong you need to fix it

1333
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,980
sooner is better because you don't want

1334
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,960
to be 65 and discover that you have no

1335
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,160
retirement

1336
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,440
then you wind up greeting people at a

1337
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,780
blue store in the doorway and it's not

1338
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,700
fun for anyone

1339
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,380
and sometimes you have to go back to the

1340
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,180
beginning you may have to retrench

1341
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,880
this is my third career field

1342
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,480
I came out in electrical engineering and

1343
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,579
Military trained me to do board level

1344
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:28,680
electrical stuff and take things apart

1345
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,000
and put them back together and that

1346
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,859
career field went completely out the

1347
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:34,440
window with microelectronics we no

1348
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,119
longer did that with board swap now we

1349
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:37,800
just throw the stuff away right we just

1350
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,940
throw our phones away nobody has to

1351
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,300
repair that you can but nobody does

1352
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,240
so over your life your career field will

1353
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,280
probably change be aware of it and be

1354
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,780
ready for it

1355
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,579
um

1356
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:52,560
you want to be in a lifestyle business

1357
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,720
by the time you're 40 preferably unless

1358
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,240
your goal is to do something like IBM or

1359
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:57,960
something where you're going to work

1360
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,940
there for 40 or 50 years lifestyle

1361
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,920
businesses are great because you can do

1362
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,960
what you want when you want and it's

1363
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,380
wonderful

1364
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,300
like I said this is my fifth startup and

1365
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,800
this is my choice I'm only working this

1366
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,780
hard because I want to

1367
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,400
um

1368
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,460
but nobody should have to do this I'm I

1369
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,200
hate to see people who are

1370
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,839
above middle age that still have to work

1371
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,119
40 hour weeks for bad companies because

1372
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:25,920
they have no choice you have a choice

1373
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,960
you just need to recognize it before you

1374
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,640
get to that point so that you can take

1375
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:32,099
appropriate steps and manage your career

1376
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:34,500
your decisions govern where you will be

1377
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,500
in 5 or 10 or 20 years

1378
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,180
all right that's it okay I'm done

1379
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,899
questions

1380
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,079
huh

1381
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,680
yeah

1382
00:49:56,819 --> 00:49:58,980
no a lifestyle business is just one

1383
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:02,060
where you're not forced to work

1384
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,339
