1
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,700
him Kick It Off

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,559
well thank you very much once again

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,260
thank you to you and your entire staff

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,140
for all the work that goes in to running

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,720
this great event I only wish I could

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,640
have been there in person unfortunately

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,480
I caught a con crud and so alas here I

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,240
am going through and presenting remotely

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,000
So today we're going to start to talk

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,700
about uh how the Galactic Empire from

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,920
Star Wars was actually destroyed by a

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,739
bad data governance program a little bit

13
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,840
about me I met Michael K Brown on

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,780
Twitter uh most importantly this

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,520
presentation as well as many of my

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
others are published on my github.com

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,760
Micah K Brown GitHub site so please feel

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,219
free to reach out I'd love to continue

19
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,120
this conversation here there anywhere

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,039
with that being said

21
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,920
whether you're a purist and you go back

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,140
to the original Origins and dark Forces

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,479
in Kyle katarn or whether you go through

24
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,900
and you follow Rogue one

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,920
the reason that the Rebel Alliance was

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,200
able to survive the Battle of Yavin IV

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,140
was because they had access to stolen

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,180
Death

29
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,740
Star plans

30
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,780
where's my proof it's right here in the

31
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,040
episode for opening crawl

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,119
right here during the battle the rebel

33
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,040
spies managed to steal a secret plan to

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,540
the Empire's Ultimate Weapon the Death

35
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,340
Star an armored space station with

36
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,439
enough power to destroy an entire planet

37
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,720
so if we are going to go through and ask

38
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,100
ourselves

39
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,460
who was this secret Rebel hero

40
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,399
that allowed the Death Star plans to

41
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,280
East Holland I'd uh I'd go through

42
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,140
another start that'd be someone like

43
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,700
this a common everyday I.T security

44
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,920
practitioner data analyst that struggles

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,320
to find a work-life bounce this person

46
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,820
probably struggles to get the correct

47
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,098
tools resources and visibility into

48
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,660
their environment so that they can

49
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,400
protect the Galactic Empire and the

50
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,099
citizens they're in so he has challenges

51
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,260
such as separating the signal from the

52
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,840
jam he's responsible for articulating

53
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,060
deeply technical issues such as the

54
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,800
bleeps the sweeps and the creeps to

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,540
others and they have challenges

56
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,360
communicating gaps concerns to Imperial

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,520
officers or in our world Senior

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,540
Management

59
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,660
also besides Chewbacca Michael Winslow

60
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,180
also deserves a medal

61
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,920
so this brings me to what is data

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,500
government anyway

63
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,599
these four different definitions one

64
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,080
from Wikipedia one from a group

65
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,180
dgpo.org another one from ibm.com and

66
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,519
another one from

67
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,099
nist.org.gov and if you were to go

68
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,959
through and read and evaluate each one

69
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,220
of these you'll see there's a lot of

70
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,560
similarities and there's also a lot of

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,720
differences

72
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,480
so for the purpose of this talk what

73
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,879
does data governance mean to me well

74
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,680
data government means different things

75
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,360
to different people it allows the

76
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,340
business to decide what data government

77
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,200
needs for itself so it generally

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,640
involves people processes and

79
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,319
Technologies not necessarily in that

80
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,540
order it allows the business to make

81
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,180
strategic decisions on how data is

82
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,340
stored processed and transmitted within

83
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,319
its environments and it should go

84
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,720
through and optimize the confidentiality

85
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,459
integrity and availability of data

86
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,500
within your organization quite frankly

87
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,920
data governance is how we decide to

88
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,459
decide on data issues

89
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,519
so I love this visualization coming from

90
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,540
nist where it clearly shows that data

91
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,620
governance

92
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,000
is

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,480
it's a higher level in terms it's the 10

94
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,580
000 foot view that is meant to help

95
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,599
guide and direct your actions

96
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,519
so putting it together when I think

97
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,860
about my organization I'm a very large

98
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,360
Financial

99
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,299
I go through and I realize that we have

100
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,120
many stakeholders that are motivated by

101
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,519
both external and internal resources so

102
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,720
external things that we might be

103
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,279
motivated are are rules laws regulations

104
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,839
contractual agreements and that might

105
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,060
Force our internal stakeholders business

106
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,280
management I.T security and legal to

107
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,560
create a data governance plan now that

108
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,320
data government plan program bonuses

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,479
focuses on topics such as ownership

110
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,419
accessibility security integrity and

111
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,300
self-knowledge of how we

112
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,100
use and work with data in our

113
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,139
environment these are expressed in

114
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,780
policies processes and procedures and

115
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,460
actually manifest in what I call

116
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,780
actionable data governance Technologies

117
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,300
so what are our goals and why would we

118
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,340
spend time money and resources

119
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,440
formalizing a formal data governance

120
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,780
program number one we want to enable

121
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,940
better decision making we want to reduce

122
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,520
operational friction we want to train

123
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,500
managers and staff to adopt common

124
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,020
approaches to Common data issues we want

125
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,520
to build standard and repeatable

126
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,040
processes and procedures that ultimately

127
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,020
are going to reduce cost and increase

128
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,020
efficiency through our coordination of

129
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,600
efforts as well as we want to be open

130
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,360
and transparent we want to make sure

131
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,759
that we are conducting ourselves with a

132
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,460
high level of Integrity both to internal

133
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,060
and external re or stakeholders

134
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,259
so

135
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,060
I've talked a little bit about it active

136
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,400
or an actual data governance tool what

137
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,740
is it well that's any tool that an

138
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,860
organization use to help support a data

139
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,320
governance program and generally these

140
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,259
tools can take some action so they can

141
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,300
just permit an action to go through they

142
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,680
could permission with a special

143
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,259
condition such as requiring a digital

144
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,539
signature or requiring that appearance

145
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,759
of information be strongly encrypted

146
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,180
before say it is sent outside it could

147
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,979
go through and it could allow the user

148
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,960
to put a justification on why they're

149
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,699
taking this action and then allowing it

150
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,680
it could go through and permit and

151
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,199
create an alert or it could deny with an

152
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,139
alert or deny without alert an alert to

153
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,199
you know so based on what tool you're

154
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,240
using different actions are going to be

155
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,039
available I just wanted to give you some

156
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,240
actions

157
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,819
so has anyone played Zelda I loved Zelda

158
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,979
still to this day and when we're talking

159
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:29,180
about data government the tree the three

160
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,160
triforces are being able to create

161
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,979
policies on how data is stored how data

162
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,080
is processed and how data is transmitted

163
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,139
but there's a fourth hidden Triforce and

164
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,460
that really is identity and access

165
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,979
management to me and why I say that it

166
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,100
is a pillar within data governance is

167
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,600
our tools are going to be making the

168
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,020
fundamental assumption that any action

169
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,840
its species being taken by a specific

170
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,740
user or an entity is that user or entity

171
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,680
actually doing that so we need to be

172
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,600
aware that in order to have a good data

173
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,160
governance program we need to have a

174
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,300
really good identity and access

175
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,280
management program within our

176
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,500
environment

177
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,960
and one thing that if you attend any of

178
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,520
my talks

179
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,940
this is a very common meme there are no

180
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,680
false positives there's only poorly

181
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,740
written rules and this is very well true

182
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,039
in a data governance in a DLP and I'll

183
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,139
show you some examples of that uh here

184
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,720
in a little bit

185
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,199
so

186
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,340
when I was creating this I wanted to be

187
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,860
able to give the guidance I'm from the

188
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,419
Cincinnati area I volunteer with the

189
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,819
Greater Cincinnati Issa and we often

190
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,520
have a lot of smaller or medium sized

191
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,319
businesses you know businesses where

192
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,680
they have a small it program or an I.T

193
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,979
person that facilitates all of it all of

194
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,900
it security and I wanted to be able to

195
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,120
provide them guidance from a from a data

196
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,880
governance perspective and so I adopted

197
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,840
what was done with the old CIF standards

198
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,940
and where I wanted to have basic

199
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,120
controls I.E the do these first the

200
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,660
foundational do these next and then the

201
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,520
organizational which are the really hard

202
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,919
data governance tools to go through into

203
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,660
leverage so we're going to talk about

204
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,860
each of those in a moment

205
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,259
this is another way to go through and to

206
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,840
view it on the top of green

207
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,800
we have what degree of an administrator

208
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,200
rights you need on each type of systems

209
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,080
the type of systems is in the gray box

210
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,120
below and then I've added whether in

211
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,919
general this technology can do a block

212
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,279
alert or an enforce policy depending on

213
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,680
the vendors that you're using they might

214
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,540
be able to do more or less but this is

215
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,640
just basically to give a quick

216
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,800
visualization of where each technology

217
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,620
fits in against different asset types

218
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,180
so let's talk about the basic controls

219
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,100
the first thing that we really need to

220
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,920
get under control is the basics and one

221
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,019
of the the some or one of the hardest

222
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,300
things that I have to do is a very large

223
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,120
organization I have over 40 000 users

224
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,700
I'm trying to protect day in day out

225
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,640
across all seven continents and one of

226
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,560
the hardest things that I have to do is

227
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,500
to do the simple things at scale

228
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,600
so we need to make sure that we're doing

229
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,700
best practices across our traditional

230
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,519
Network we need to find ways to automate

231
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,740
and test basic controls basic

232
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,779
functionality whether that's firewall

233
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,540
rules VLAN restrictions particles

234
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,700
protocols that are known to be abused

235
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,899
often

236
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,959
one thing that I've often found is we

237
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,880
can film a whole lot of time building up

238
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,459
a really good secure environment whether

239
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,040
it's a CDE whether it's a guest wireless

240
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,959
network whether it's our own internal

241
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,080
network but if we don't go through and

242
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,060
we aren't constantly testing and

243
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,580
validating those environments have a

244
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,459
tendency to erode into security and that

245
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,740
can be a huge deal especially as you're

246
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,200
going through and working to establish a

247
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,600
data governance function so this is

248
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,560
where

249
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,360
they will you want to go through and we

250
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,220
want to make sure that we're doing the

251
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,959
basics on our Network and our general

252
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,060
infrastructure make sure that we have a

253
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,440
secure Foundation that we're building

254
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,060
off of

255
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,940
next it comes down to file and disk

256
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,760
encryption as well as Key Management

257
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,040
when it comes to encryption you can only

258
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,860
be as strong as your key management so

259
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,420
we need to make sure especially those

260
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,040
private keys that we're protecting them

261
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,220
that if they are lost we can go revoke

262
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,380
them that we can quickly spin up new

263
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,839
certificates and get back to a good

264
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,600
place now strong encryption of the

265
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,640
client system is definitely best

266
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,060
practice we see now both Microsoft and

267
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,519
Apple have really normalized encryption

268
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,579
across most devices in a very seamless

269
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:00,899
way

270
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,839
inside work with a global

271
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,779
organization I understand that there are

272
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,720
different rules laws regulations that

273
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,480
are in force in different areas of the

274
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,519
world and we need to be respectful of

275
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:17,459
those countries and those laws that we

276
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,019
operate Within

277
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,940
another thing that I've noticed is that

278
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,760
it might sound very attractive as to us

279
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,820
as I.T security people to go through and

280
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,680
to turn on Advanced encryption such as

281
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,579
fips 140 however most times I see a

282
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,380
commercial solution allows you to enable

283
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,040
fips 140. it comes to or it comes at a

284
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,339
cost of certain functional capabilities

285
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,500
and it might make some tasks just a

286
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,760
little bit harder I'm not saying it's

287
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,519
not a good thing to turn on fips 140 if

288
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,380
you have to have it you have to have it

289
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,260
but just keep in mind that there might

290
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,100
be a little bit more of an

291
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,620
administrative overhead if it if you

292
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,060
choose to turn it on and you're not

293
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,079
required

294
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,200
now encryption of files written to

295
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,500
portable media is often thought of as a

296
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,200
very popular control after all we don't

297
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,620
want our data leaving our laptops in an

298
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,779
unauthorized fashion however we need to

299
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,300
be very careful on how we do that I have

300
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,700
a friend that they rolled out a rule

301
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,860
that any piece of portable media got

302
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,360
bitlockered

303
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,540
and unfortunately they took out all of

304
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,300
the at the time that organization had a

305
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,399
lot of remote claims work so they would

306
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,620
send people out on site to take pictures

307
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,959
of various insurance claim

308
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,240
and they had to go through after about

309
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,760
200 of these GPS devices were bricked

310
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,860
when people plugged them in to try to go

311
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,079
through and update the maps on them

312
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:46,680
so just be be aware of those types of

313
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,860
use cases also I do not want to be the

314
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,060
person that uh is responding because a

315
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,420
an employee came back from maternity

316
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,579
paternity leave and they brought a

317
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,440
thumbstick that had you know pictures of

318
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,180
the new baby that they wanted to share

319
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,940
with the rest of the organization and

320
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,459
oops we encrypted that person's personal

321
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:11,820
drive so we want to be

322
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,240
able to make sure that we are doing

323
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,540
things in accordance

324
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,240
with our strategic views as well as we

325
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,459
are educating our users so that they

326
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,560
know that if they do plug in a personal

327
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,700
device

328
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,620
what exactly is going to happen to try

329
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,680
to minimize loss of personal data

330
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,320
and all encrypting files at the network

331
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,120
or share level might seem attractive

332
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,880
please keep in mind Key Management how

333
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,459
is the keys going to be stored process

334
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,740
transmitted so that we don't have

335
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,480
unintentional

336
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,000
leaks

337
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,459
so finally violent Integrity monitoring

338
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:53,880
so there's many different way or vendors

339
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,740
that do file an Integrity monitoring and

340
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,860
truth be told this is saved so a lot of

341
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,019
people that I've known a lot of times so

342
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:03,660
in general these systems will go through

343
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,519
and you'll point them at either various

344
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,279
servers or data repositories and these

345
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,079
systems will

346
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,860
record every user as they make any

347
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,980
changes any additions any ads any

348
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,160
deletes and they'll basically create a

349
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,560
record of who what where when why many

350
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,079
of these systems have the ability either

351
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,660
to Archive Shadow copies to make

352
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,180
restores very easy

353
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,880
but they also have other things where a

354
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,680
lot of them are going through and adding

355
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,959
end user Behavior end user behavioral

356
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,839
analytics so if a user

357
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,880
generally stays in the engineering

358
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,880
folder on the share but they never touch

359
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,860
the HR well it's kind of odd if they

360
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,680
start going through and touching HR and

361
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,120
pulling

362
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,360
up 100 files for example that might be

363
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,000
something that we might find as odd and

364
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,100
we might want to investigate so that's

365
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,500
some pretty cool functionality that you

366
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,839
can get out of here but where I've seen

367
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,480
a lot of use cases

368
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,120
is with ransomware

369
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,399
a an organization gets hit with the

370
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,899
ransomware if they have a file an

371
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:14,880
Integrity monitor they can go through

372
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,440
and they can see

373
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,100
show me all files that have the dot

374
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,199
encrypted or whatever extension it adds

375
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:25,019
to the end of the encrypted files and

376
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:28,019
they can see exactly what computer what

377
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:31,199
user touched that specific file that

378
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,139
makes it very easy to identify at least

379
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,500
the initial in or one of the initial

380
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,660
encrypting device where we can go

381
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,160
through isolate that get it off the

382
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,079
network start doing a root cause

383
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,360
analysis but we can also go through and

384
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,959
ask these types of systems show me all

385
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,480
of the files that have the dot encrypted

386
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,100
or whatever extension they're using

387
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,740
across your entire environment now that

388
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,540
makes it very easy for us to then go

389
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,620
through

390
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,079
and to take that list and to give that

391
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,579
to the backup team so the backup team

392
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:05,279
knows exactly what tapes they need to

393
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,459
recall so that we can respond quickly so

394
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,760
this these file and integrity monitors

395
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,980
they're really they've saved many of my

396
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,160
colleagues bacon quite a bit and there

397
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,399
are definitely a good thing to look into

398
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,100
so now let's look at the foundational or

399
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,399
the middle level types of actual data

400
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,139
governance tools the first one is mobile

401
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,199
device management so mobile device

402
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,740
management as I really saw come out of

403
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,680
the bring your own devices movement and

404
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,500
it's great for that whether you're using

405
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,259
a very well known Cloud solution or if

406
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:47,300
you're running one on your own campus

407
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,180
MDM has definitely made an inroad in

408
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,120
allowing greater flexibility for us as

409
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,160
it Security Professionals and for our

410
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,199
Workforce but lately I've been seeing

411
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:02,040
MDM move into another section and that's

412
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,640
either non-standard or lightweight

413
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,520
company owned devices where the device

414
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,439
actually owns to the company and whether

415
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,280
it's tablets cell phones or even Ultra

416
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,880
lightweight laptops or mobile systems I

417
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,099
really see the Enterprise adoption of it

418
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:23,339
MD I'm significantly deep or ticking up

419
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:26,160
in the case of BYOD and non-trusted

420
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,100
external devices we need to respect

421
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,740
that we are guests on that client system

422
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,940
that the

423
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,340
owner is truly the owner of those

424
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,559
systems we need to go through and make

425
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,500
sure enrollment is just as graceful

426
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,080
as the enrollment we need to make sure

427
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,539
that we are clear and concise

428
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:48,179
on what we are doing on that environment

429
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,580
and what rights they are giving us

430
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,900
access to

431
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,660
and one thing I'm always hesitant of I

432
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,100
have no problem

433
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,299
wiping the MDM space that we create on a

434
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:04,020
BYOD but I'm very hesitant even if I

435
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,900
have the user making the request of

436
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,880
going through and wiping the entire

437
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,500
device even if we do have the

438
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,020
capabilities so I would definitely go

439
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,220
through

440
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,100
and talk to legal on that case and make

441
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,919
sure that we have the appropriate ways

442
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,980
in which a user could request a full

443
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,320
Erasure if that's what they truly want

444
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,678
to do

445
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,260
next is identity and access management

446
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,140
and I've had many people rightly Heckle

447
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,559
me that identity and access management

448
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,679
is outside the sphere of data governance

449
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,200
however almost all of the decisions that

450
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,960
are actual data governance tools are

451
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,880
going through and taking are based on

452
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,559
the assumption that the user that that

453
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:53,700
tool sees is the actual original user

454
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,940
or entity that is making that request

455
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,299
it's not always so I've set in on a

456
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,760
couple red team classes I understand

457
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,120
how people can go through and can move

458
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,740
laterally in the environment I

459
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,080
understand how people can go through it

460
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,020
can impersonate processes and or other

461
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,419
user accounts so having a very strong

462
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:18,480
identity and access management makes it

463
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,960
so that that our actual data governance

464
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,720
intelligence the signals the alerts that

465
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,280
we're getting out of there are going to

466
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,320
be much more strong have much more

467
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,460
greater integrity

468
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,740
so the risks are not limited to just the

469
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,559
user idea I've seen a lot of compromises

470
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,539
going through and starting to abuse

471
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:42,840
machine accounts and it's only common to

472
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,799
go through and to see that as well as

473
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:49,320
there are several different attacks to

474
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,260
try to go through and to

475
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,240
circumvent multi-factor authentication

476
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,640
in fact there's a very well-known attack

477
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,200
where the attacker just spammed a person

478
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,200
50 60 75 different multi-factor

479
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,299
authentication requests until the user

480
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,100
finally got quiet and clicked yes it's

481
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,600
me

482
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,840
about starting about 2018 maybe a little

483
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,900
bit before that a very common thread

484
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,419
came to be that active directory is

485
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,700
insecure by default and I've provided a

486
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,160
couple different uh sites for you that

487
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,740
you can look up and

488
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,620
for what they were going through and

489
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,280
addressing they were right and many of

490
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,260
my colleagues that have gone through and

491
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,280
have

492
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,919
had to remediate the this these types of

493
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,780
insecurities I've had to go through a

494
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,260
full domain Forest migration and team

495
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,020
that's a lot of work to go through and

496
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,760
to do but it's important that you

497
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,220
understand especially from an identity

498
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,460
and access management request what your

499
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,039
domain functionality level what it can

500
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,140
do and what it can't do so that we can

501
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,760
go through and we can make Intelligent

502
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,980
Decisions as we go through and

503
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,140
constantly work to increase the security

504
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,140
of our organizations

505
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,440
so data classifications this is one of

506
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,020
the things that is the hardest for many

507
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,240
organizations to do is to really un be

508
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,580
able to understand

509
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,679
programmatically intelligently what data

510
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,660
they are working with and where it

511
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,600
resides in their environment and so when

512
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,100
you're dealing with data classifications

513
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,440
you have two main types of data

514
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,179
classification so you have traditional

515
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:32,400
data classification which is based on a

516
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,440
series of data objects such as text

517
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,080
dictionaries regular Expressions pattern

518
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,260
matching and Boolean logic and this can

519
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,539
be challenging why because well there's

520
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:45,780
many different versions of reg X and so

521
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,360
some tools will use a

522
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,120
very specific version of

523
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,640
my apologies like can you still see my

524
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,799
screen

525
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,140
okay because my screen just went black

526
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,020
so I'll continue on so with

527
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,120
different tools understanding different

528
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,860
regular expression dictionaries that can

529
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,440
make it very difficult for us to

530
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,039
actually go through and to ensure that

531
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,840
our data classifications are very

532
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,880
similar often

533
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,120
it is very difficult to move

534
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,059
data classifications from one system to

535
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:22,380
another

536
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,860
and have it be one 100 you're going to

537
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,360
get it very close in the ballpark but

538
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,059
it's very hard to keep it 100

539
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:32,820
another very popular option is something

540
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,760
it's usually called meta tags and that's

541
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,559
where in the Header information of the

542
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,960
file we write a very specific code or a

543
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,380
meta tag into that Header information

544
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,340
and that has several benefits so it is

545
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,580
much more lightweight to go through to

546
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,740
scan for our meta tag data than it is

547
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,260
for another or for a traditional type of

548
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,580
data classification because in a

549
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,140
traditional data classification you have

550
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,780
to scan the entire file or as a meta tag

551
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,880
you're only looking at the top however

552
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,679
since it's usually our users going

553
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:06,539
through and applying the meta tag for

554
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,360
example Microsoft Office has a component

555
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,539
where you can go through leverage

556
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,159
specific functionality and this is

557
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,740
another office documents uh LibreOffice

558
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,620
open Office have several capabilities

559
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,299
where you add a little Ribbon or when

560
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,580
you save it has a little pop-up and it

561
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,220
says we here at company care about the

562
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,620
Integrity of and security of our data

563
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,480
can you please help us apply the correct

564
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,000
classification and the user can

565
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,220
literally go through and click web

566
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,200
classification and once they click and

567
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,419
they click OK that specific data

568
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,100
classification meta tag is written in

569
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,080
the header of the document and now it's

570
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,320
very easy for us to go through and scan

571
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,640
now the problem with this type of

572
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,100
classification is our users can just lie

573
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,600
to us right

574
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,260
so this is where a combination of

575
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,780
traditional classification plus meta tag

576
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,600
classification works really great for

577
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,020
ourselves

578
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:06,600
to go to a bit of a deep dive on this

579
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,200
traditional data classifications

580
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,500
can be very challenging so the United

581
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,600
States currently has 50 states each of

582
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,520
these states is able to write their

583
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,340
driver's license in any way that they

584
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,720
want to this results in our current

585
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,400
classification 26 different regular

586
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,260
expressions

587
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,440
many websites to this day go through and

588
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,440
use 15 or 16 digit your numeric codes

589
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,500
when referencing contact y'all

590
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,320
what does that look like to you if you

591
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,360
are a computer it looks like a credit

592
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,820
card information in fact I've even had

593
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,940
these types of alerts I've ran them

594
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,679
through the link check and they came

595
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,780
back as positive even though their

596
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,820
intended use was not to be an actual

597
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,919
credit card it actually passed the love

598
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,320
test

599
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,760
regular expression in word dictionaries

600
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,980
they can be very challenging I'll show

601
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,020
you in the next slide and when you're

602
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,280
building your traditional data

603
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,340
classification rules always follow the

604
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,500
primary rule of improv comedy and pair

605
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,080
them together with yes and I've got

606
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,919
burned in fact my DLP talk that I've

607
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:20,340
given many places has some of uh the

608
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,980
very comedic ways in which I wrote when

609
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,140
I deviated from this Rule and finally

610
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,700
proximity rules when you're dealing with

611
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,860
traditional data classifications where

612
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,840
you're looking for condition a and

613
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,900
condition B within x amount of

614
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,179
characters from each other those are

615
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:39,179
very powerful but they are also very

616
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:42,960
costly in terms of compute cost

617
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,159
so right here is on the left is our

618
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,860
driver's license positive ID match the

619
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,440
challenge was is that we were hitting a

620
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,039
bunch of other types of

621
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:59,700
data that were not driver's license but

622
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,039
they're being flagged so things like our

623
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,960
incident tickets things like our change

624
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,880
tickets things like our problem tickets

625
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,940
things like year year year month month

626
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,640
day day or day day month month year year

627
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,559
year

628
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,380
notes were being tagged even things such

629
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,520
as our

630
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,580
our user IDs our admin IDs our

631
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,039
contractor IDs they were all going

632
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,559
through and they were all being flagged

633
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:28,980
as credit cards so our eyes driver's

634
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,020
license so what I had to do is on the

635
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,320
right I went through and I created an

636
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,140
exception a negative exception path the

637
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,480
problem is is whenever I create an

638
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,240
exception regular expression

639
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,059
I'm introducing a big door for false

640
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:47,820
negatives to go through so this is where

641
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,679
you need to make sure that the juice is

642
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,539
worth the squeeze when you're going

643
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,100
through and you're adding negative

644
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,080
exceptions or else you're going to

645
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,779
introduce false negatives potentially

646
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:59,580
into your environment

647
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,039
all right uh we're at the bottom of the

648
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,020
hour and it's time to start talking

649
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,020
about the organizational controls

650
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,419
so as I alluded to before I've got an

651
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,659
entire another talk that goes into Data

652
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:16,020
loss prevention and so I'm not going to

653
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,620
go super deep on this however

654
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:23,039
when I was a little baby I.T security

655
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,400
practitioner I used to think that a

656
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,980
effective data loss prevention strategy

657
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,860
would be from a single vendor with a

658
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,080
single management station that control

659
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,200
multiple different tools that would all

660
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,720
work together to deliver

661
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,419
an effective data loss prevention

662
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,919
it's no longer that anymore what I see

663
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,120
is a lot of different vendors are adding

664
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,960
DLP like functionality into your already

665
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,140
existing environments for example your

666
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,140
web proxy probably has a component that

667
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,440
does what DLP web does if you're using

668
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,380
Office 365 or another emailing provider

669
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,720
they either have partners that integrate

670
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,559
and do DLP on the mail server or it's a

671
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,720
feature that you can enable in the

672
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,299
various mail Cloud that you have

673
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:21,480
uh so any more

674
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,860
it's

675
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,080
it's the exception that I see a single

676
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,779
what I term a scan engine or vendor when

677
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:30,120
it comes to a full stack DLP

678
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,220
implementation and this brings up some

679
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,039
challenges this brings up some problems

680
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,659
because

681
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:38,640
as you fragment and bring in more and

682
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,840
more vendors

683
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,260
each vendor is going to have their own

684
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,400
default set of information when it comes

685
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,600
to

686
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,840
the actual data classifications and the

687
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,000
challenge is is that if you go through

688
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,919
in the moment that you customize

689
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,059
something

690
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:00,120
a library a regular expression

691
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,620
dictionary

692
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,740
then you've lifted the responsibility

693
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,559
for maintaining that off of the vendor

694
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,299
shoulders and now it's directly on your

695
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:10,440
shoulders

696
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,360
and this manifests itself in a couple

697
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,440
issues

698
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,460
in that

699
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:19,320
when you go through and you have

700
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,260
multiple DLP vendors coming in you could

701
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,380
have the situation where let's say you

702
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,500
have HIPAA data where HIPAA data on your

703
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,520
network DLP is going to be looking for a

704
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,500
completely different set

705
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,520
of rules then hit the information on

706
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,120
your DLP web or a different set on DLP

707
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,820
email and that can make jobs for your

708
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,140
for the people that are going through

709
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,340
and getting the results very complicated

710
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,659
so

711
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:54,360
when it comes to various DLP compliance

712
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,520
you know the DLP client that's just

713
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,500
something that generally sits on a

714
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,059
client system and looks at how your

715
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,520
users are interacting with data I have

716
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,559
seen some places that have put the DLP

717
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,320
client on servers but that's really the

718
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,260
exception rather than rather than the

719
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,620
norm the DLP Network I like to think of

720
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:19,020
this as a DLP or as a IPS that instead

721
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,580
of looking for potentially malicious

722
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,100
attack traffic instead what we're going

723
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,320
through and what we're looking for is

724
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,640
that potentially sensitive information

725
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,720
crossing a segment of our Network the

726
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,399
repository scanner

727
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,020
this is something where you can go

728
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,059
through and you can point this

729
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:38,700
repository scanner to any type of data

730
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,220
store it could be a file share it could

731
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,279
be a SharePoint it could be databases

732
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,980
depending on the repository scanner you

733
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,779
might have more or less different

734
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:51,419
targets that it supports but it goes

735
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:52,559
through crawl through that entire

736
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,260
environment and returns where you it

737
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,760
thinks you have potentially sensitive

738
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,320
information

739
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,260
DLP email you know that's just DLP

740
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,140
inspection on incoming and outgoing

741
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,779
email personally I like to scan incoming

742
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:10,860
email for DLP not because I'm

743
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,620
necessarily responsible for the security

744
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,880
of data

745
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,700
before I receive it but I want to see if

746
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,039
I see a repeated pattern of data coming

747
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:22,919
in in a sub-optimal manner I want to be

748
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:25,559
able to proactively reach out and have a

749
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,440
conversation to correct that DLP web if

750
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,720
you're lucky enough to use a web proxy

751
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,899
you can pair something like a DLP web up

752
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:35,820
with that through generates through

753
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,460
icaps so that you can do on top of Av

754
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,440
inspection for incoming and outgoing

755
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,559
traffic also DLP inspection and then you

756
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,940
have the Management console and this

757
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,240
Management console really it's per DLP

758
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,340
vendor that you have in the environment

759
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,740
and I have to go through and caution you

760
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,320
one of the biggest

761
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,980
concerns that I see with many DLP setups

762
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,880
is where the DLP Management console sits

763
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,760
so we have to acknowledge that data loss

764
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,380
prevention

765
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,779
designed to find where our most

766
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:12,480
sensitive data is going through and from

767
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,600
a programmatic perspective where it's

768
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,760
being used in violation of that policy

769
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,159
and at that time we create an incident

770
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,320
now those incidents usually have the who

771
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,980
what where when why the rule was tripped

772
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,860
but they also usually have a summary of

773
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,860
the offending data as well as many of

774
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,539
the popular

775
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:35,880
DLP environments that I've

776
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,299
sat down with they actually include as

777
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,640
long as the file is not too large the

778
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,539
entire file or the entire pcap of what

779
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:47,399
that data actually was so you can go

780
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:50,399
through and you can validate that so if

781
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,370
you are say a PCI DSS customer

782
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,020
[Music]

783
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,820
ought to be treating your Management

784
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,240
console as having the potential to have

785
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,220
the most sensitive information in your

786
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,440
environment so that means that you

787
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,600
should place your Management console as

788
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,100
if it's going to hold PCI DSS HIPAA glpa

789
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,700
gdpr whatever those most critical types

790
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,940
of rules laws regulations contractual

791
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,980
agreements you should place your DLP

792
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,840
within your environment as if it is

793
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,779
going to contain that type of data

794
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:27,419
let's put our let's put our red hats on

795
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:29,279
here

796
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,159
an offensive person and I go through and

797
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,659
I land and I get shell onto a system

798
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:40,019
if I'm looking to steal sensitive data

799
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,779
to encrypt sensitive data and I see that

800
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:45,179
they're running a DLP environment

801
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:46,679
because all you have to do is list the

802
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:49,320
services most of the DLP agents that

803
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,779
I've actually come across report their

804
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,240
exact name when you take a look at what

805
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,679
processes are running up this system

806
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,260
this is not rocket Sciences for an

807
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,059
offensive personality

808
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:03,840
if I know that there's a DLP environment

809
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,919
it and I can escalate my credentials my

810
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,359
privileges so that I can get into that

811
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,460
DLP Management console that's going to

812
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,379
make automating where I want to Target

813
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:17,460
my attack really freaking simple so we

814
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,080
need to make sure that we're putting the

815
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,820
appropriate controls around the DLP

816
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,520
console to prevent people especially

817
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,639
malicious people from abusing it

818
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,199
so

819
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,199
some other concerns that we ran into is

820
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,960
that the DLP client can have a lot of a

821
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,280
lot of overlap with a lot of

822
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,659
functionality with the rest of the

823
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,320
environment for example

824
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,839
many DLP clients can look at the network

825
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:44,399
traffic going in and out of the client

826
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,099
it can do repository scanning it can do

827
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:50,099
email scanning it can do web scanning

828
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:52,739
my personal view is I want to keep the

829
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,899
client as lightweight as possible and

830
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:56,820
move as much off of the client as

831
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,160
possible

832
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,680
because of that what we did is we went

833
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,320
through and we installed a and there are

834
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,760
many different agents that do this so

835
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,220
the particular name isn't critical but

836
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,040
it was a little application that it

837
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,500
would every five seconds and take a

838
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,839
compute cost so CPU memory disk IO

839
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,480
Network i o per process and dump that to

840
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,760
the database and so we had about five

841
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,760
systems within security as we were

842
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,020
building our process that was running

843
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,900
this especially monitoring so that as we

844
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,560
make move Edge changes we have actual

845
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,320
systems in the hands of power users so

846
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,480
that we can understand did the rules

847
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,980
that we go through and added did they

848
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,460
add a significant burden on the actual

849
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,320
performance of the end user machine

850
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,140
because trust me once you turn DLP on on

851
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,640
a client system

852
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,859
everyone is going to assume that the

853
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:52,260
Slowdown is because of that however in

854
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,420
many cases we did find significant

855
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,079
incompatibilities say for example I love

856
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,640
Google Chrome they're doing a lot of

857
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,940
good however one of the flaws at least

858
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,280
from a DLP perspective was the very

859
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,859
first time my users got an update to

860
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:10,020
Chrome was the very first time that my

861
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,960
DLP vendor got an update to Chrome and

862
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,300
there was a conflict Google changed

863
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,720
their backing code and our DLP the way

864
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,280
that they're hooking into Chrome to do

865
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,380
DLP inspection it completely broke it

866
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,859
such that Chrome would just refuse to

867
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:27,000
Launch

868
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,460
so I walked in on a Tuesday and I have

869
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,660
150 different incidents in my inbox and

870
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,060
it's before 8 A.M I'm like what the heck

871
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,060
is going on I go to log into my help

872
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,579
desk ticketing system Chrome comes up

873
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:45,000
Chrome's Clash I try to watch it again

874
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,180
uh I think I know what's going on here

875
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,440
so

876
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,500
to resolve this my end or my vendor had

877
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,180
to take three weeks to really reverse

878
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,700
engineer the changes that were made and

879
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,200
rewrite

880
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,320
how they did Chrome inspection

881
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,900
that was not popular with our user base

882
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,020
so this gave us the ability the

883
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,240
justification to move off of local

884
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,960
inspection on the machine and move it to

885
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,720
inspection that is done with the DLP web

886
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,960
we also had other incompatibilities

887
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,520
primarily and this was interestingly

888
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,579
enough a lot of devsecops tools code

889
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:24,920
tools

890
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,119
compilers those seem to have a lot of

891
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,099
issues so we had to bypass them from

892
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:31,500
inspection and

893
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,180
finally how do we make sure that the

894
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,800
client gets deployed in a consistent

895
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,520
fashion as systems are added and removed

896
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,900
from our environment so we had to do

897
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,079
some interesting

898
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,300
reports and some interesting things with

899
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,920
our client teams to make sure that we

900
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,099
were getting the proper deployment

901
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:53,339
also we found various areas of the DLP

902
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,500
what I call DLP Enterprise can overlap

903
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,800
with other parts for example

904
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,380
we were getting duplicative alerts out

905
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,260
of our DLP Network for both email and

906
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,800
web now when I looked into the quality

907
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,960
of the alerts the alerts that I was

908
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,339
actually getting were much higher

909
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:13,619
quality in the email in the web portion

910
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:16,380
so basically I tuned out any traffic

911
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,859
tour from the email and the web server

912
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:22,619
or the DLP web system from actually

913
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:25,320
being inspected by the DLP Network once

914
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,480
again trying to make sure that we were

915
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,960
getting the most appropriate of hits

916
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,300
next casbian

917
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,680
so

918
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,500
many people have rightly gone through

919
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,200
and mocked me just a little bit in that

920
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,540
casby is just the LP for the cloud I

921
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,760
said you kind of have a point there but

922
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,680
it does some other stuff as well now in

923
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,359
general I see two different ways that

924
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,000
casby's are

925
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,520
are set up these days the first one is

926
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,500
in line so you put an inline of your

927
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,940
production traffic going out to the

928
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,060
internet say from your offices out and

929
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,619
then you can do inspection and you can

930
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:04,740
see everything that is going from your

931
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,220
office out the this has some advantages

932
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,220
but it does not go through and it does

933
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,200
not it cannot see

934
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,740
how your cloud is being accessed outside

935
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:21,000
of those few network connections that

936
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,680
you are going through and inspecting

937
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,940
that you're tapping

938
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,900
so another option is you give the casby

939
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,240
basically an access token to your

940
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,280
authorized cloud and then it can go

941
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,320
through and simply tap in and do all of

942
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,359
its functionality that way the challenge

943
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:40,500
there is is it is those types of fun or

944
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,180
of casby's they're going through and

945
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,740
they're seeing everything that you're

946
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,900
doing to your authorized clouds but

947
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,640
they're not able to see what's going on

948
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,859
with your Shadow clouds which is what

949
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:51,839
the first type the inline methodology

950
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,660
will look so whether you're going when

951
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,240
you're going to look at casby make sure

952
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,980
that you clearly Define what your use

953
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,200
cases are what you're looking to do and

954
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,720
that you choose the appropriate model I

955
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,940
know that a couple of my friends

956
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,640
especially at larger organizations they

957
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,420
have a mixture of casby's or even within

958
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,760
the same casbian mixture of solutions to

959
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,960
do scanning on both sets

960
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,839
so finally digital Rights Management so

961
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,339
this isn't something that I really have

962
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,680
a whole lot of professional experience

963
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,359
with and I included it in this because I

964
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:34,920
want to kind of disprove that this is

965
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,020
a golden ticket

966
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,619
trm has matured over the years it's

967
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:43,140
behind the scenes whenever we're we're

968
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,180
working with many of our content

969
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,780
delivery services for example apple and

970
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,359
it's fair play uses a lot of DRM to make

971
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,339
sure that only authorized people are

972
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:55,980
viewing their movies their audiobooks

973
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,660
their textbooks

974
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,900
and I just want to acknowledge

975
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,060
that in especially in the hacker

976
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,940
communities that

977
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,820
the process of DRM cracking has been

978
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,339
something that has been celebrated since

979
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:15,060
before the DVD key got leaked so there

980
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,720
are many tools techniques tactics that

981
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,420
have been rallied well defined and well

982
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,359
communicated on how to go through and

983
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:28,920
how to try to start to crack various DRM

984
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,480
processes

985
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,780
another thing I want to warn you about

986
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:36,960
is always bring legal counsel when

987
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,380
you're building in your DRM solution and

988
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,359
what you want the DRM to do especially

989
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:44,820
if you're going to do honey pop files

990
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,160
based on talks that I've had with

991
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,339
various lawyers something as simple as a

992
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:53,099
ping home embedded into a Honeypot

993
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:55,800
document could introduce legal liability

994
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,079
to either yourself or to the

995
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,900
organization trust me I want to stay on

996
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,000
the correct side of prison the outside

997
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,599
so always bring legal in when you're

998
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:09,300
designing those types of Honey Pop files

999
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,040
and what actions you're going to have

1000
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,680
those honey pot files perform

1001
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,380
and with that I want to thank you I'm
