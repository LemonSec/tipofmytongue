1
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:12,960
all right so uh we're gonna we're gonna

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,519
talk a little bit about uh developing

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,560
policies and uh procedures for your

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,480
organization uh mainly around cyber

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,160
security but this kind of works for any

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,260
any policies and procedures

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,960
um that you may uh May wanna

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,640
they want to look at but here's a little

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,840
bit about me

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,500
um not as young as I think I look but uh

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,239
yeah I've been doing this for a few

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,940
years started uh building PCS for a

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,620
little little shop in town and uh

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,020
decided that uh I didn't like working

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,940
with

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,500
people's home devices and and got into

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,920
system administration found a a pretty

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,800
pretty serious interest a little later

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,500
on in cyber security and it's kind of

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,860
eaten me like a monster since then so uh

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,539
I've kind of

22
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,260
uh taking a taking a deep dive into uh

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,239
more the the business side interestingly

24
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,360
enough of applying cyber security which

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,340
is uh kind of where part of this this

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,799
presentation comes from

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,080
um you know I've got a master's in cyber

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,580
security from the University of

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,560
Charleston here locally so shout out to

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,659
them there they were out here had a

31
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,259
table uh fantastic organization

32
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,759
comma cissp I have a house full of

33
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,960
humans and animals so working from home

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,100
has been

35
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,299
wonderful and a challenge and so you

36
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,979
know we talked about that a minute ago

37
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,320
it's it's been uh interesting and I'm

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,140
I'm glad to be back to somewhat a normal

39
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,000
uh

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,340
convention environment to being able to

41
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,140
come and see at least a few people since

42
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,939
since we have more than the the four

43
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,200
that we started with a couple minutes

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,479
ago so that's fantastic

45
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,420
um and then uh this is this is my

46
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,939
favorite time of year because we have uh

47
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,040
all the haunted houses popping up and I

48
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,140
helped to operate one here here locally

49
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,140
so when I leave here this shirt will

50
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,000
turn into a purple demon running around

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,480
scaring kids children grown men who

52
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,480
pretend like they're not scared so uh I

53
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,739
know everybody's looking forward to

54
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:17,940
whatever they're going to do this

55
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,080
evening for the rest of their Saturday

56
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,959
evening me I'm gonna go run and scare

57
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,000
people so

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,640
all right speaking of scary things we

59
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,440
have some terms and definitions here

60
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,760
we're not going to spend a whole lot of

61
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,379
time on them but I like to kind of make

62
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,120
sure that everybody's speaking the same

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,000
language when we get started because a

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,860
lot of times people will have a slightly

65
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,900
different point of view on uh you know

66
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,700
what the uh

67
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,340
definition of a word is in their uh

68
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,980
their particular area of expertise so

69
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,319
now we're talking about policies and and

70
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,440
these are just broad General statements

71
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,959
that uh the the management of an

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,780
organization is going to um kind of put

73
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,879
forth that that give you basic rules

74
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,860
that you want to follow

75
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,459
um

76
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,040
then kind of below those those policies

77
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,200
you have additional things that aren't

78
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,260
necessarily uh included in your policy

79
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,260
but their their standards

80
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,900
guidelines processes and procedures uh

81
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,519
standard is is going to be something

82
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,040
that's really required and we're going

83
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,739
to get a little deeper into these things

84
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,800
um here in a few minutes but just kind

85
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,739
of give you an overview of where we're

86
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,599
where we're coming from in this

87
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,980
discussion and here we go it's again uh

88
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,180
so

89
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,980
we're going to talk a little bit about

90
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,159
risk and how that informs your policies

91
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,459
and and your processes going forward so

92
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,099
having a clear definition of how you

93
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,319
understand what that means is going to

94
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,180
be important so

95
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,920
um we'll start at kind of the bottom of

96
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,200
that stack with vulnerability which is

97
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,780
really very simply just a weakness in

98
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,060
whatever process you have it can be a

99
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,360
weakness in a system and how it operates

100
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,659
it can be a weakness in how data either

101
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,640
digital or physical moves through your

102
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,060
organization but it's a weakness in that

103
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,659
process a threat then is just going to

104
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,600
be anything that can smack that process

105
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,279
down and tell it nope you're not going

106
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,820
anywhere today and then we have what

107
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,699
most businesses are are concerned about

108
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,520
and that's the risk you know what uh

109
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,680
what is this going to cost us at the end

110
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,900
of the day if uh one of these one of

111
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,720
these threats comes through and this is

112
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,800
really what you're going to build your

113
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,960
policies off of in a lot of the

114
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,940
instances you're going to look at these

115
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,460
these risks and say okay what rules do

116
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,440
we need to have in place in order to

117
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,759
make sure that everybody in the

118
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,740
organization knows what they need to do

119
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,199
in order to help build a consistent set

120
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,380
of processes and keep our business

121
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,300
moving the way it should

122
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,180
so

123
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,400
but the question everybody really kind

124
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,740
of asks is is this important do these

125
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,360
actually keep me safe do they actually

126
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,240
keep our data safe our policies what do

127
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,860
the job and

128
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,300
you know kind of the answer to that is

129
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,900
uh sort of you know you've got uh uh

130
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,320
certain business needs for policies you

131
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,639
know the first one that pops into most

132
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,280
people's minds is going to be that uh

133
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,039
compliance requirement so you know the

134
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,460
the glpa the HIPAA the SEC requirements

135
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,759
any any of those things that if uh one

136
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,199
of those Auditors walk into your office

137
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,800
and start uh asking you questions and

138
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,840
and they say okay you know let me see

139
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,759
your see your policies for this that and

140
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,840
the other thing

141
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,580
and you don't have them and they're

142
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,259
going to say okay well that's number one

143
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,539
and they're going to start down the down

144
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,940
the list usually there are fines

145
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,660
involved with a lot of those

146
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,940
lacks in in having those policies even

147
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,340
just in place and not just uh in

148
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,039
practice that comes in a little later

149
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,020
because if you have a policy that's not

150
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,880
in practice it can be just as dangerous

151
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,940
as not having that policy at all

152
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,780
um

153
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,759
but you know these these policies

154
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,620
they're they're they're there not only

155
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,020
to satisfy regulatory requirements but

156
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,400
to codify and reinforce the uh

157
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,220
management support of cyber security and

158
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,120
uh

159
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,860
that uh

160
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,660
kind of uh

161
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,020
culture of making sure that everybody

162
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,900
knows and understands what their role is

163
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,479
in helping to support the security of

164
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:40,759
the organization

165
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,940
and it helps to clarify that process and

166
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,060
improve that uh

167
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,479
ability to to be consistent in your

168
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,900
cyber security and in training and

169
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,880
delivering that information that end

170
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,699
users need to be secure and to operate

171
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,419
in a manner that fits within the

172
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:04,680
parameters that they need to in order to

173
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,220
be secure

174
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,860
so

175
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,000
how many of you

176
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,780
are

177
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,800
granted the power to create policy for

178
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,539
your organization just right out of the

179
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,240
gate I hear you're the

180
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,940
the the policy

181
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,979
person that signs off says Yep this is

182
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,960
organization wide we've got we've got

183
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,860
two

184
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,259
well that's impressive usually usually

185
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,080
that's not the case for for any of us uh

186
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,740
usually there's a board of directors or

187
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,180
some other folks in the c-suite that

188
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,300
that have that that power so

189
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,520
your first step is is going to be if

190
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,060
you're you know trying to provide a

191
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,800
develop a new policy for your

192
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,620
organization is to figure out who in

193
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,360
your organization you have to go to in

194
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,599
order to get that uh that approved and

195
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,759
then

196
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,620
um not just uh

197
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,180
find somebody who's going to be able to

198
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,699
approve that but find some people in

199
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,099
those positions that are going to

200
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,080
support you because without that

201
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,240
managerial support that executive

202
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,360
support your policies may not have any

203
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,020
teeth you know your your end users

204
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,759
are going to probably push back against

205
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,620
anything that makes their day harder

206
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,099
right I mean that's the reason why most

207
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,200
of us have less hair than we did

208
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,539
yesterday is because our our end users

209
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,599
and and the folks that we work with just

210
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,039
absolutely

211
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,580
uh hate having their their uh jobs

212
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,640
disrupted by what we do so having that

213
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,920
having that support is going to be a a

214
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,600
pretty big deal

215
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,279
um and then

216
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,260
you know we're gonna we're gonna use

217
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,860
that um

218
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,540
relationship that you're going to

219
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,399
develop with uh with those those

220
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,160
Executives to

221
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,040
kind of focus on

222
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,500
talking to them in a in a in a way that

223
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,420
they understand you know your your

224
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,080
business uh folks the the c-suite they

225
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,480
they don't speak our language right you

226
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,700
know you start talking about uh

227
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,540
firewalls and passwords and just about

228
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,459
anything else that has to do with

229
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,320
technology they start to you know glass

230
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,480
over right you get that Blank Stare and

231
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,760
they're like okay just tell me how much

232
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,339
is it gonna cost and then the answer

233
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:38,339
after that is usually no because

234
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,580
yeah it's got to cost them some money

235
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,740
um so what you want to do is really take

236
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,160
a look at uh those uh this this this

237
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,080
policy that you're trying to develop

238
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,019
from their point of view and present it

239
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,660
in a risk-based manner something that

240
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,040
that tells them

241
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,899
you know what uh

242
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,300
what is this going to

243
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,640
reduce what risk is this going to to

244
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,279
minimize for us do we have a particular

245
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,399
risk that we are looking at that is

246
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,640
costing the organization money or is uh

247
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,459
reducing the amount of productivity in

248
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:17,760
the organization and so if we put this

249
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,240
policy in place and follow the policy

250
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,000
part two then uh you know we're going to

251
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,779
see an improvement in uh you know either

252
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,300
lower cost because we're not having to

253
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,720
deal with as many issues or in uh better

254
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,240
productivity so you know you're talking

255
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,220
to them in this this manner that they

256
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,279
they understand this

257
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:44,399
risk risk management language

258
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,019
um and then you know when you're

259
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,200
you're I I really don't like uh

260
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,060
trying to

261
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,180
scare people at least not during October

262
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,380
yeah uh it's it's all fun and games to

263
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,040
jump out and say Boo on Halloween but to

264
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,100
uh uh take it and use that fear

265
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,899
uncertainty and doubt to try to drive

266
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,420
your your agenda forward is is probably

267
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,160
the wrong way to go about it

268
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,760
um but it's not a bad idea to at least

269
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,279
make use of the market information

270
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,980
that's out there to help support your

271
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,440
risk analysis

272
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,459
it lends some some credibility to what

273
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:32,399
uh what you're showing management if you

274
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,540
have examples of similar

275
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,760
similar activity with other other

276
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,220
organizations in your in your industry

277
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,339
to be able to say you know hey this is

278
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,620
this is happening it happens you know at

279
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,300
least this frequently to other

280
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,640
organizations in our vertical

281
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,260
and so

282
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,860
this is this is where I got that uh uh

283
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,640
kind of likelihood percentage that we

284
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,160
will probably be hit by the same type of

285
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,040
thing and we need to put those walls up

286
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,640
so don't use that uh fear is your

287
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,920
primary tool use it as a tool to help

288
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,500
underscore and support your your other

289
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,600
uh

290
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,519
bits of information that you're you're

291
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,040
providing to them to uh

292
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,420
develop your your policy plan here so

293
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,060
your policies are going to have a life

294
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,980
cycle just like everything else that we

295
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,680
talk about frequently in cyber security

296
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,200
and developing in cyber security program

297
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,980
the policy is cyclical and it's a living

298
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,459
document

299
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,700
we've got four stages that we're gonna

300
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,800
going to talk about here just just

301
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,360
briefly

302
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,600
um so the first is identify either

303
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,700
create Implement and maintain and each

304
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,459
of these stages is important and they

305
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,260
each have different measurements of of

306
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,060
success and

307
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,579
uh wind conditions if you will so we'll

308
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:05,399
talk about uh talk about each of those

309
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,180
that first step identify is uh

310
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,120
you know where you need to figure out

311
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,760
what this policy is that you need and

312
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,320
this is where you start that risk

313
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,180
assessment process I think there have

314
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,399
been a few talks today where people have

315
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,860
either briefly mentioned risk assessment

316
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,980
or kind of gone into a little more more

317
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,839
detail there but

318
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,540
in in general you know you're going to

319
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,760
look at your organization and you're

320
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,459
going to say what what risks do we have

321
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:38,100
are we are we looking at

322
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,120
um

323
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,760
a particular

324
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,760
system that is

325
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,760
older than it should be isn't being

326
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,600
updated and we need to deal with that

327
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,880
are we looking at a bunch of systems or

328
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,060
a March of systems that are coming up in

329
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,860
the next few years and we need a policy

330
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,440
that says okay we need to have a life

331
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,880
cycle management policy for our devices

332
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,220
you know what's the what's the risk

333
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,360
there so you're going to start that

334
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,899
process of determining you know what uh

335
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,940
what types of vulnerabilities you have

336
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,940
what types of threats there are out

337
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,639
there that are potentially going to make

338
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,820
use of those uh those vulnerable systems

339
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,380
because they're going to be unpatched

340
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,420
over the next few years

341
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,320
um

342
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,100
and then you know you may have

343
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,740
various regulatory

344
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,019
requirements we kind of mentioned that

345
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:40,639
earlier you uh have your HIPAA PCI DSS

346
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,860
those uh organizations that part of

347
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,660
their their assessments and their

348
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,820
requirements have certain policies that

349
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,260
you need to have in place

350
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,779
and that may

351
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:55,220
present as a risk not just to

352
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,639
the bottom line in fines but uh in the

353
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,220
case of something like PCI DSS you may

354
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,720
no longer be able to process credit

355
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,500
cards so at that point that is a

356
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,699
different type of risk to the

357
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,639
organization it's not so much

358
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,100
an initial monetary fund but an

359
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,380
inability to conduct business the same

360
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,760
way you did yesterday

361
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,740
which

362
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,860
hurts the the bottom line and

363
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,740
that's one of those things that our our

364
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,040
business leaders and decision makers

365
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,480
don't like when

366
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,699
those types of failures hurt that bottom

367
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:36,000
line that kind of uh that kind of way

368
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,420
um and then you know you may have uh

369
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,300
a decision that's that's been fired off

370
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,060
from uh upon high that says okay guys

371
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,459
we've decided that we're going to

372
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:48,959
implement

373
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,959
XYZ framework and that framework may

374
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,579
have some

375
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,699
various policies that are recommended or

376
00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:00,060
the map from other particular best

377
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,760
practices so you're going to identify

378
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,220
what those those policies need to be and

379
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,420
then you're going to start collecting

380
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,820
data you're going to start looking at

381
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,760
what parts of your organization are

382
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,320
going to be affected by the policies

383
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,959
because potentially a policy that you

384
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,760
put in place may not affect the entire

385
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,160
organization it may be a policy that

386
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,199
only affects a small subset of the

387
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:23,820
organization a particular operations

388
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,040
group

389
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,800
so you want to figure out what that

390
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,660
scope is and also determine the

391
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,100
assets that are that are within that

392
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,199
scope that that policy is going to going

393
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,519
to affect and then find out who is an

394
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,259
expert on those things because

395
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:49,320
you know even even though most most of

396
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,240
the folks we work with may think that we

397
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,800
know everything about what's going on in

398
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,980
the organization we really don't

399
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,959
and so finding people that understand

400
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,300
the processes of each of these different

401
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,759
groups within our organizations will

402
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,679
help us to build a policy that makes

403
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,959
sense for that group or for that part of

404
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,599
the organization and then

405
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,079
you know if you're not the person who's

406
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,079
actually going to write this policy you

407
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,540
may have input into it but uh maybe

408
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,419
somebody who's better at it than we are

409
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,880
at that point you need to also try to

410
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,619
identify who that's going to be and and

411
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,100
get them on the team because in a lot of

412
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,540
cases especially in larger organizations

413
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,220
these policies aren't going to be

414
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,260
developed in a in a vacuum they're going

415
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,700
to be a group effort

416
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:49,320
so this one may seem a little

417
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,960
intuitive but the next step is going to

418
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,440
be to actually create that policy and uh

419
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,179
I've got a I've got a quote here from

420
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,460
from Gartner that I want to read and

421
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,799
it's their their definition of what a

422
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,960
policy actually is especially a

423
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,780
specifically a cyber security policy the

424
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,940
Gartner says a cyber security policy

425
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,700
defines and documents an organization's

426
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,980
statement of intent

427
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,960
principles and approaches to ensure

428
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,820
effective management of cyber security

429
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,580
risks in pursuit of its strategic

430
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,980
objectives

431
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,280
that's very flowery language for saying

432
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,160
it's a very broad basic rule that says

433
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,380
this is how we want to do things

434
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,260
or this is what we want you to do

435
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,820
but we're not going to tell you exactly

436
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,280
how to do it yet

437
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,059
um

438
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:42,360
so uh

439
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,899
let's see here

440
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:48,419
there is uh

441
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,880
an example I've got here of a good

442
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,179
policy statement is one from actually

443
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,100
from the White House they're they're

444
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,720
great at being you know federal

445
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,419
government created being super vague

446
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:02,400
it's the the perfect policy statement so

447
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,840
this is uh

448
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,419
uh from the

449
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:09,360
Executive Administrative Branch it's the

450
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,480
policy of my Administration that the

451
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,299
prevention detection and assessment of

452
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:18,059
and Remediation of cyber incidents is a

453
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,400
top priority and essential to National

454
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,260
and economic security the federal

455
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,720
government must lead by example and all

456
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,000
federal information systems should meet

457
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,520
or exceed the standards and requirements

458
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,980
for cyber security set forth in the

459
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,480
issued pursuant and issued pursuant to

460
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,760
this order so

461
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,000
that's a really long bunch of words that

462
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,700
say almost nothing but it's a perfect

463
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,820
policy it tells

464
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,740
the person who's reading this policy

465
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,480
that

466
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,039
our intent

467
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,580
from the top is that we're going to

468
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,720
try to be as secure as possible

469
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,600
and we're going to follow a set of

470
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,820
standards that we'll tell you about

471
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,440
later

472
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,100
um

473
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,160
so yeah those those those standards that

474
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,679
come behind that you know are are things

475
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,380
like uh

476
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,559
uh your incident response plan your uh

477
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,860
system hardening Sops

478
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,140
um those are those are the uh things

479
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,720
that support your your policy at that

480
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,820
point so

481
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,879
um

482
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,620
as you uh as you work through trying to

483
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,020
determine what policy you're going to

484
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,080
build your uh

485
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,980
going to go through a review process and

486
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,140
a

487
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,840
pretty good idea and going through this

488
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,400
review process is going to be to take

489
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,720
take that policy and walk it out to the

490
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,440
folks it's going to affect not everybody

491
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,919
but find some people who are part of the

492
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,500
organization real real people out there

493
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,820
that know how those processes work and

494
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,900
kind of tabletop through how that policy

495
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,660
is going to affect their operations

496
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,140
and take their input and go back and if

497
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,660
if they have massive changes or small

498
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,120
changes rework that policy until it is

499
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,000
something that your end users are going

500
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,280
to find acceptable but still meets the

501
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,440
need that your organization has to

502
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,500
implement some sort of a set of controls

503
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,159
that support that policy

504
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,159
um

505
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,159
and then

506
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,500
of course once you get that ready to go

507
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,299
you're going to take that policy up and

508
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,760
hand it to that individual who's going

509
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,200
to sign off on it be it the board of

510
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,140
directors your your c-suite

511
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,600
the

512
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,620
manager for a particular operations

513
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,600
group or you or you and uh get that get

514
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,480
that policy signed off on

515
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,960
right here before we move forward I want

516
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,780
to take a quick look at

517
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,500
a

518
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,460
sample policy

519
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,580
from Sans and uh

520
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,280
so we can see or at least you guys can

521
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,580
see that uh

522
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,299
policy

523
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,799
if you scroll down

524
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,260
give me just a second here so I can see

525
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,620
it too

526
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,500
thank you

527
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,120
okay

528
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,900
so this is this is just a sample policy

529
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,059
I pulled off the internet from the Sands

530
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,460
Institute they they provide these under

531
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,200
a kind of a

532
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,600
oh

533
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,620
free to use non-commercial

534
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,400
way but uh

535
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,100
this this policy is a password

536
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,460
protection policy nothing super exciting

537
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,179
or super fancy has a uh

538
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,360
kind of an overview it gives a brief

539
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,640
description of what the policy

540
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,820
is about and the uh

541
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,539
how the reason for the policy

542
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,220
and then

543
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,159
as we kind of mentioned before provide

544
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,559
some information about the scope of the

545
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,780
policy

546
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,880
who does it uh who does it apply to and

547
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,260
what we're we're gonna

548
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,720
what we're going to do as part of that

549
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,820
policy so

550
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,980
get in the meat of the actual policy

551
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,140
itself

552
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,059
you see there are there are statements

553
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:31,140
like

554
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,419
all user level and system level level

555
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,880
passwords must conform to the password

556
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,159
construction guidelines

557
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,539
it doesn't tell you what those

558
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,760
guidelines are because this is just the

559
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,679
policy

560
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,740
a a good policy is going to be very very

561
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,340
simple very concise and very clear and

562
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,320
if there's any more information that

563
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,140
needs to be addressed any specifics

564
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,559
about the how that's involved in a

565
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,140
policy you're going to do that in either

566
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,419
your standards your guidelines or your

567
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,940
procedures and those documents are going

568
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,620
to going to be separate it makes it

569
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,260
easier to maintain your policies if

570
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,919
they're Broad and very simple

571
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:16,080
you have to go back and change them less

572
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,100
you have to get approval less often uh

573
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,080
if you're if you're working with your

574
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,299
your standards and your procedures from

575
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:28,020
uh that policy approval standpoint

576
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:32,100
and it becomes a lot more more scalable

577
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,940
and a lot easier to deal with your

578
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,100
overall policy Suite

579
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,100
um

580
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,720
a couple other key parts of a policy

581
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,659
that are really uh

582
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:47,340
I think are important as you're as

583
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,080
you're putting one of these together is

584
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,240
that

585
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,659
they have a compliance section here that

586
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:55,620
um

587
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,480
kind of talks about

588
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,880
who is going to be in charge of making

589
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,980
sure that you guys are following the

590
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,720
rules or that everybody in the

591
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,100
organization is following the rules

592
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,039
again it doesn't necessarily say how

593
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,720
specifically it does give some examples

594
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,100
of how that might happen but uh

595
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,000
it does kind of inform the uh the reader

596
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,100
as to you know what to expect as far as

597
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,380
oversight and then provide some of those

598
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,440
teeth that we talked about in the case

599
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,020
of non-compliance so

600
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,220
uh

601
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,340
read a lot of policies that have no

602
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,120
non-compliance in them and at that point

603
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,059
if there's

604
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:44,520
no sort of a negative to not following a

605
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,960
policy

606
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,700
is anybody actually going to follow that

607
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,900
policy

608
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,120
yeah they're they're they're not they're

609
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,179
they're just gonna say okay yeah

610
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,279
Bob and Bob and I.T said I have to have

611
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,900
a strong password and not stick it

612
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,320
underneath my keyboard but you know I

613
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,760
never see Bob and

614
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,620
and he uh

615
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,900
he doesn't uh he's not the boss of me

616
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,860
anyway nah so I'm not gonna do that and

617
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,000
then

618
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,220
you know I have passwords not just under

619
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,840
my keyboard but all over my cubicle

620
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,039
because I can't

621
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,799
uh you know so it's important to have

622
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,900
that that extra little uh that that

623
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,940
extra piece that extra non-compliance

624
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:28,440
piece in your uh in your policy or

625
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,720
you know there's there's a pretty high

626
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,400
likelihood that it's never going to be

627
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,480
followed

628
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,960
um the other piece of that is that uh

629
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,880
managerial support are the executive

630
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,140
support that we talked about a little

631
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,600
earlier because if they're not willing

632
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,400
to put their weight behind those uh uh

633
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,200
disciplinary actions

634
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,080
again the words on the paper don't mean

635
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,080
much so you've gotta gotta have that

636
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,900
that backing of the uh the folks that

637
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,299
have the uh the power to

638
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:03,179
bring that hammer down as it were uh or

639
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:08,580
again the policy is uh almost useless

640
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,799
and then

641
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,320
they mentioned the password construction

642
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,840
guidelines that uh were talked about

643
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,100
before as a document to reference in uh

644
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,580
developing your uh passwords and there's

645
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,620
a revision history in here one of the

646
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,580
sections that is is missing in this

647
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,559
particular policy is a definition

648
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,340
section A term section

649
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,279
this particular policy where it sits as

650
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:41,159
a template doesn't really have a lot of

651
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:44,520
terms that I would think people might

652
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,159
not know but uh

653
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:50,940
it's important again to think about your

654
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,220
user base and the people that are going

655
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,260
to be reading this policy and needing to

656
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,240
comply

657
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,700
and making sure that they understand the

658
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,799
language that you're using and that goes

659
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,480
back to making sure that the policy is

660
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,960
clear and concise and using uh

661
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,100
that's simple terms as as possible so

662
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,320
that it's it's understandable to anybody

663
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,879
that picks it up and reads it

664
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,779
there

665
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:24,140
not too bad

666
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,740
all right so we'll switch back to the

667
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,460
slides here

668
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,520
poor little laptop it's decided it's

669
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,020
Saturday too and it doesn't want to do

670
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,559
its thing it's just chilling

671
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,760
it's in Turtle mode

672
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:55,919
upload my cluttered desktop it's

673
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,220
terrible

674
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:07,399
we might get back to the slots

675
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,100
there we go

676
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:44,100
Okay so we've got an approval we've

677
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,080
we've gotten everybody so that they they

678
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,120
like the policy and it's

679
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,880
it's going to be sent out there into the

680
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,140
world

681
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,640
how are you going to get it out there

682
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,679
into the world

683
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,840
um it's time to time to implement the

684
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,480
policy are you just going to drop it in

685
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,340
a folder and say okay guys this is our

686
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,559
this is our new policy have fun with it

687
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,899
or uh are you going to have a plan for

688
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:09,000
for making sure that everybody in the

689
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,520
organization knows that there's a new a

690
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,500
new policy available

691
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,960
so at this point you really should have

692
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,480
or should already have a

693
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,760
plan for Distributing the policy

694
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,059
you are going to want to know where

695
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:25,559
you're going to store it that's great

696
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,539
but uh

697
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:29,940
you may also want to make sure that you

698
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,159
send at least an email out to everybody

699
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,860
and say Hey you know we've got this new

700
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,840
policy please go out and read it please

701
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,399
please please

702
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,580
foreign

703
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,419
how many people are going to actually go

704
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,700
read the policy after you do that yeah

705
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,980
at least they know it's there right and

706
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,559
if they want to know if they can

707
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:53,159
no that's uh you've at least distributed

708
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:55,679
the policy and and communicated it but

709
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,860
uh it's it's important to also make sure

710
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,220
you train your uh your folks on the

711
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,899
existence of that policy train them so

712
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:06,899
they understand the purpose of the

713
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:11,899
policy not just the uh policy itself

714
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:15,360
people tend to accept things when they

715
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,539
understand the why something exists a

716
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:21,120
little easier as opposed to it doesn't

717
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,559
matter why

718
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,059
Mommy and Daddy just said so right so

719
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:27,899
um

720
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:30,480
as part of that uh that training about

721
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,760
the policy and and of course any

722
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,480
additional processes and standards that

723
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,960
may support that policy but uh you make

724
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,600
sure that uh they're not only aware but

725
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,380
they understand what that policy

726
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,299
is is for what it's supposed to help

727
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,860
improve

728
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,480
and

729
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,760
then uh you know test folks on that

730
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,320
some of the uh larger organizations

731
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,820
their their only choice really is going

732
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,120
to be to to try to send out some uh

733
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,940
standardized types of testing you know

734
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,500
answer these questions at the end of

735
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,080
your training session and and make sure

736
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,220
that you uh pass with at least a 70 or

737
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,419
better and

738
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:20,700
you know you've been uh you've been

739
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,519
trained on our new policy but uh some of

740
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,279
our smaller organizations get to have a

741
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:29,519
little more fun with it uh

742
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,940
some of the uh things that I've seen

743
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,779
people do is is just go out and uh just

744
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:39,480
randomly sit down with individuals in

745
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,760
their in their organization and strike

746
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,260
up a conversation

747
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:47,100
as awkwardly as possible about the new

748
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,100
policy that's that's been put in place

749
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,399
and then try to gauge their uh those

750
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:56,159
those folks understanding and then yeah

751
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,720
scaring back to their office and make

752
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,620
notes that Sue gets it or Bob does not

753
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,059
you know

754
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:04,860
um but uh

755
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:08,639
make sure that you you you know that at

756
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,440
the very least

757
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,719
um everybody that's received that

758
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,080
training has uh at least a base level

759
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,960
understanding of the uh what and the why

760
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,260
of the new policy

761
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,460
so

762
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,199
I've mentioned

763
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,839
a couple of times the uh

764
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,639
different supporting documents that

765
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,418
you'll have for uh for a policy

766
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:36,560
um standards guidelines procedures

767
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,960
these are the really the the how part of

768
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,418
your your policies

769
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:45,980
um but they are not in your policy

770
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,719
specifically uh these are these are

771
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,280
documents that are going to be separate

772
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,500
entirely from from the policy and

773
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,899
reference there

774
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:57,119
so you've got kind of at the

775
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,940
at the the middle the uh multiple

776
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,760
policies uh or multiple processes and

777
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,740
procedures that your organization has

778
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,339
that are necessary in order to support

779
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:11,339
this new policy and these are these are

780
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:13,260
step-by-step instructions these are

781
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,540
standard operating procedure documents

782
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,500
of the uh the how to to

783
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,740
comply with the policy as it's as it's

784
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,119
written

785
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,680
um you know these are these are things

786
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,820
that could be uh like incident response

787
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,680
plans the actual plan the step-by-step

788
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,500
of if this incident happens this is what

789
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,859
we're doing one two and three

790
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:39,720
um you know a standard operating

791
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,800
procedure for new user creation

792
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,440
that's going to have steps that include

793
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,940
that uh password creation policy

794
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,240
password protection policy that was uh

795
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,000
kind of looked at a few minutes ago

796
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,780
um

797
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:02,880
you're going to have to potentially have

798
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,440
a workstation setup procedures that are

799
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,380
governed by your by your policies and

800
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,300
will be affected by those those policies

801
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,720
that are going to have to support what

802
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,540
those policies are are saying so that uh

803
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,900
those operations are are in compliance

804
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,359
um and then you've got standards that

805
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:29,339
kind of uh dictate how the processes are

806
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:32,880
performed but are also defined by your

807
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,380
policy and standards are

808
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,880
lots of things actually they could be

809
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,460
anything from a framework like the

810
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,300
missed CSF framework or they could be uh

811
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,359
internal Frameworks internal standards

812
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:50,520
that you develop for your particular

813
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,280
system hardening they could be

814
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,359
um

815
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:57,380
the uh

816
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,040
documents from CIS for system hardening

817
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,800
that uh are referenced by the policy

818
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,420
let's say this is this is how we set up

819
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,180
a a workstation uh

820
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,660
in a policy that says this is the

821
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:17,540
standard for uh how we want you to apply

822
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,820
systems uh new systems to the network

823
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,820
and then you have guidelines which are

824
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:28,980
very similar to policies but or sorry

825
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,900
it's definitely the end of the

826
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,839
conference it's almost time but you've

827
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,420
got uh

828
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,960
guidelines are less strict standards

829
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,200
typically are required whereas a

830
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,060
guideline is going to be something that

831
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,280
is

832
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,440
semi-optional you know you may have a

833
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,359
policy that says we need to protect our

834
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,660
passwords and there may be a guideline

835
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,859
that says

836
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,320
we would like you to use a password

837
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,680
manager and we don't necessarily care

838
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,260
what password manager you use but here

839
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,140
are a few that we might suggest

840
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,800
um

841
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,920
you don't have to use these but you know

842
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,320
just as a general guideline these are

843
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,800
good so it's not required but heavily

844
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,839
suggested

845
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,900
um

846
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:28,380
and that leads us to the final or first

847
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,160
um

848
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,339
stage in the life cycle of a policy

849
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:35,160
which is to maintain that policy

850
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,960
and this is the really really fun part

851
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,800
because uh you get to sit there and try

852
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,900
to figure out if it worked

853
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,740
um

854
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,099
yeah I say that with a little bit of

855
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:50,880
sarcasm because trying to keep track of

856
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,119
all of this is uh it depends on the

857
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:56,099
person but not necessarily as fun as it

858
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:57,359
could be

859
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,140
um

860
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,000
so you're you're looking to to Really

861
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,980
measure uh several different things

862
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,560
about your your policy in its life cycle

863
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,579
in order to determine what to do next uh

864
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,740
and so you're looking to to measure the

865
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,260
effectiveness of the uh of the policy

866
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,240
itself you're you're looking to evaluate

867
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,520
if it was useful did it have a positive

868
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,500
impact on some risk in the organization

869
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,760
um you know did you achieve a level of

870
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,320
awareness across the organization that

871
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,480
everybody is like okay yeah I know this

872
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,020
policy exists and did you get to a point

873
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,200
that is acceptable that they

874
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,119
sort of understand what it is you want

875
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,220
them to do

876
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,200
and then you want to try to measure that

877
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,780
that compliance

878
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,240
you know this uh

879
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,160
this information you're going to take

880
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,640
and you're and you feed that back into

881
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,119
uh that view of the policy on on some

882
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,880
sort of a regular basis

883
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,680
for a lot of policies at the very least

884
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,720
you're going to want to try to take a

885
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,700
look at the manually to make sure that

886
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,339
they're doing what they're supposed to

887
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:11,880
um if if a policy is no longer useful if

888
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,599
it's not providing the desired effect as

889
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,900
far as preventing

890
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,300
negative impact on the organization it's

891
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,220
time to remove it you know if you have

892
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,520
an ineffective policy it's a risk that

893
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,259
policy becomes a risk in and of itself

894
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,280
you know if

895
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,780
the policy is not making it out to

896
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,599
everybody that it needs to if it's uh if

897
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,820
people don't understand the policy then

898
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,980
they're likely not going to be complying

899
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,560
with the policy and

900
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,220
um

901
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,800
then you've you've missed the mark on

902
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,099
getting that policy actually implemented

903
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:54,720
and at that point you don't necessarily

904
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,460
need to reevaluate the policy but

905
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,800
potentially your distribution plan or

906
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,040
your policy training plan for for making

907
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,660
sure that people know and understand

908
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,940
what's going on with the

909
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,760
with the policy and then

910
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,280
that that process kind of starts all

911
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,760
over again

912
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,280
there are

913
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,140
a couple of quick things because we're

914
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:23,220
getting kind of towards the end

915
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,500
I wanted to show you guys

916
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,880
just

917
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,040
as

918
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,260
some places to maybe maybe get started

919
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,780
because sometimes determining where to

920
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,900
start with policy is is

921
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,520
difficult

922
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,119
um that that first step going through a

923
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:46,920
risk evaluation is is difficult so you

924
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,480
um end up

925
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,900
needing to find at least somewhere

926
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,099
somewhere to get a good start

927
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,619
over

928
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,160
so

929
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:04,859
I kind of mentioned the uh

930
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:06,960
CIS

931
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,859
framework a little earlier but uh

932
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:14,040
this is a neat little document from

933
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:19,099
the MS asok that Maps

934
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,740
some Sans policy templates

935
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,578
to

936
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:29,940
various missed uh missed framework items

937
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,599
and it's it's super super simple and it

938
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,099
gives you a real quick

939
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:36,720
Place to Start If you're trying to

940
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,280
implement a

941
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,500
uh in this framework in your in your

942
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,260
organization or at least parts of the

943
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,060
nist framework in your organization that

944
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,280
makes sense so

945
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,119
um

946
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:51,480
you see that they're in green can you

947
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,480
guys see that is it big enough yeah Okay

948
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,720
cool so you see they're in in green uh

949
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:03,420
the actual uh actually a link to the uh

950
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,540
Sans policy template that you can start

951
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:08,880
uh to to build that policy from that

952
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,280
that fits your organization

953
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,599
um

954
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:15,440
and then

955
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,140
this is a

956
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:29,040
on this document but has a lot of

957
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,720
a lot of

958
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,900
good information about

959
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,300
specific risks that uh

960
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:43,880
are

961
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,619
I may not scroll all the way down there

962
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:53,000
it's like page 28.

963
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,119
anyhow

964
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:03,180
um so this uh this document kind of

965
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,900
provides a uh a look at the

966
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,319
uh

967
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,939
different areas that uh

968
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,319
okay I didn't begin

969
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:32,359
it's much easier if I can see too right

970
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,359
that's still big enough for you guys to

971
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,900
see out there

972
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,399
good that's fantastic

973
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,960
there we go

974
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,819
all right

975
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,260
so

976
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,720
I found this this really uh kind of a

977
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,980
helpful helpful document because it uh

978
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,560
it kind of gives you a a starting place

979
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,660
for

980
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,160
um

981
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,400
at least some some ideas of

982
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,520
what types of controls you may want to

983
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,640
may want to implement and at a high

984
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,680
level

985
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,500
here we go

986
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,960
at a high level

987
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,740
what uh what those risks may be so

988
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,060
um you know right here they're they're

989
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,220
discussing access control and they

990
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,660
provide a little bit of information

991
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,839
about the uh what basic security

992
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:25,380
requirements they have for protecting

993
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,260
controlled unclassified information they

994
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,420
could be really applied to just about

995
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,720
any organization that uh

996
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:38,640
this uh this first item is a almost a

997
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,180
perfect example of a uh policy statement

998
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,339
which is to limit system access to

999
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:46,920
authorized users processing and acting

1000
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,920
on behalf of authorized users

1001
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,240
yeah

1002
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,460
very general but gives you a place to

1003
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,160
start and it provides you some some

1004
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,960
information as to the why that uh

1005
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,660
control is important and provide you a

1006
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:06,359
jumping off point so

1007
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:08,460
um don't don't be afraid to to go

1008
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,680
searching the internet and looking for

1009
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:15,060
uh things like this that help to uh

1010
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,760
get you started in developing your your

1011
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,720
policies because

1012
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,960
you know sometimes the uh

1013
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,079
hardest part in any of this is finding

1014
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,180
that that starting point

1015
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,260
um

1016
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,359
that's uh that's all I've got for you

1017
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,160
guys today if you guys have any

1018
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,440
questions for me or are you just ready

1019
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,900
to run screaming from the building and

1020
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,839
get a get a burrito

1021
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:46,500
yeah one uh one thing that that I do you

1022
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,119
were talking about going going out to

1023
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:50,220
the website is you know I talked about

1024
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:53,040
before we started this I mean you know

1025
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,079
in the accounting sector so one thing I

1026
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:57,780
do is I look for this policy accounting

1027
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,319
right and gigs you know get see what

1028
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:03,240
other people are going and also reach

1029
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,619
out to

1030
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:06,180
um you know other accounting purposes so

1031
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,040
it's like hey what are you doing so it

1032
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,960
helps give you some ideas you know you

1033
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,480
don't want to just copy and paste what

1034
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,560
they have

1035
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,960
um because it really benefits from

1036
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,720
writing out your own but at least get

1037
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,920
some ideas you're like hey I never

1038
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,180
thought about this or hey I never

1039
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,680
thought about doing it this way because

1040
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,040
of our specific type of software that we

1041
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,160
use or things like that so yeah exactly

1042
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,880
um another another great resources is

1043
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:36,000
industry peer groups you know we've got

1044
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,680
groups like

1045
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,339
secure WB and those that are are kind of

1046
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:44,520
broad but within individual verticals

1047
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,619
there are peer groups for cyber security

1048
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:47,940
and

1049
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:52,680
I.T in general that could be very uh

1050
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,380
very good resources to to talk to other

1051
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,359
other individuals about the types of

1052
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,300
policies that they put in place

1053
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,339
types of controls that they they have

1054
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:06,000
that they've seen that are effective uh

1055
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,480
and what potentially controls aren't uh

1056
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,060
aren't effective at all and they just

1057
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:16,140
make everybody mad so you know those

1058
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,300
those peer groups in addition to doing

1059
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,900
that that research on your own are also

1060
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,359
a fantastic resource so it's another

1061
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:26,940
reason to get involved in the

1062
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,099
communities that we have which are

1063
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,180
fantastic so

1064
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,598
anybody else

1065
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:39,119
yeah everybody's sleeping out there

1066
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,040
it's the end of the day

1067
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,560
made it to the end I have kind of a

1068
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,500
monotone voice it's kind of soft so

1069
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,260
maybe a little soothing

1070
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,660
probably wouldn't put it on your uh

1071
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,880
Echo device to help you get to sleep at

1072
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,839
night but

1073
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:56,579
at the end of at the end of a day like

1074
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:57,720
this

1075
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,279
probably not helping anybody so

1076
