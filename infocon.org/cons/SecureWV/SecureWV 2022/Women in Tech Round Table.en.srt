um we uh our presentation is about women

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,239
in technology and we have four

13
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,120
distinguished women here joining us on

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,160
the panel so I'll give a quick

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,719
introduction to them and let them give

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,399
you their backgrounds

17
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,020
um we're basically following in the

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,320
footsteps of Ada Lovelace she was the

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,780
daughter of a romantic poet Lord Byron

20
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,739
and his wife Anna Isabel Byron she uh

21
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,099
she lived in the early 1800s her

22
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,200
mathematical Talent shown through in her

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,420
early life and her skills and interests

24
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,340
in machines led to a working

25
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,040
relationship with Charles Babbage

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,560
Babbage was the inventor of the

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,420
analytical engine

28
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,759
it's it was a complicated device that

29
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,700
never actually got built but um it

30
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,140
resembled the elements of a modern

31
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,439
computer and as a result of her work on

32
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,380
the project Ada is often referred to as

33
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,140
the world's first computer programmer

34
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,079
it was her notes when the analytical

35
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,040
engine that Alan turning Turing used as

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,200
a form of inspiration for his work on

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,079
the first modern computer in the 40s

38
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,780
so um we're gonna chat a little bit

39
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,420
about women in technology get to know

40
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,700
these ladies here and why they they

41
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,560
decided to go into a career in

42
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,100
technology and then maybe go into

43
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,820
um

44
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,560
like what advice they would give to

45
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,060
somebody starting off

46
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,280
so um we'll get going with some

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,840
introductions first so you'll get to

48
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,699
know our panelists so I'm going to start

49
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,139
with you

50
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,900
um Alicia Joseph if you can give them a

51
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,520
little bit of a background

52
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,879
um what you do now and um maybe what got

53
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,800
you interested in technology and then we

54
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,599
can introduce Hannah

55
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,720
hey guys so my name is Alicia Joseph I'm

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,780
a senior at Marshall University majoring

57
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,480
in cyber forensics and security I

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,760
graduate this fall

59
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,660
um

60
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,080
so what got me interested in Tech I

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,340
honestly

62
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,099
had done like a career exploration thing

63
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,440
for college and

64
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,920
I had walked past the Cyber well it was

65
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,500
digital forensics at the time but I

66
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,420
walked past that table and I thought it

67
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,959
sounded really cool and the major did at

68
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,660
least because I really loved true crime

69
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,720
documentaries and

70
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,519
I kind of got into it based off of that

71
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:03,780
because I was like well I can look

72
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,940
through phones and recover deleted

73
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,580
messages or contacts and I thought that

74
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,620
would be a really cool thing to learn

75
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,360
and then I also thought it would be cool

76
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,459
to learn how to do penetration testing

77
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,879
all right Hannah yeah um my name is

90
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,379

91
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,720
hold this real close uh my name is Jimmy

92
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,599
I'm on the board for securewb here um

93
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,920
you've probably seen me run around like

94
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,379
crazy sorry

95
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,940
um I what was the question

96
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,319
interested in technology

97
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,900
yep uh

98
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,599
I worked for a DSL tech support company

99
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,519
that was on the job training and it was

100
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,040
way better pay than the previous job I

101
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,780
had and I was like we'll just give this

102
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,519
a go and it turns out I was actually

103
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,260
pretty decent at it

104
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,820
um I really like the problem-solving

105
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,680
aspect of it and that's what kind of

106
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,919
kept me in and that was probably

107
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:29,639
the 10-ish 12-ish 13-ish years ago and

108
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,560
event ever since currently I am a

109
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,000
systems administrator for the federal

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,460
government and

111
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,479
um I've been doing that for the past

112
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,340
couple years I've been in and out of

113
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,560
government contracts also that kind of

114
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,960
got my foot in the door here I my

115
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,919
undergrad is actually in Business

116
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,240
Administration through West Virginia

117
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,520
State University and Institute

118
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,400
um nobody in my family prior to me had

119
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,240
gone to college we didn't have a clue

120
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,360
um my poor mom bless her heart uh she

121
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,860
was like here just go get a paper and

122
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,639
like do a thing and I was like um

123
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,340
but that actually kind of served me well

124
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,360
worked my way up

125
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,139
um

126
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:10,080
and then I received my master's degree

127
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,240
in what is that called technology

128
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,100
management for Marshall a couple years

129
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,419
ago that's super great program and uh uh

130
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,860
yeah so I guess what got me interested

131
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,160
in it was just it was a better pay uh

132
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,919
frankly and I I just enjoyed it it kind

133
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,419
of worked out and that's uh that's where

134
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,780
I'm at now

135
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,000
Francie hi guys I'm Francine Hammond

136
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,360
I come with three degrees and basically

137
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,580
in electronics business and education my

138
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,820
current role right now is a systems uh

139
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,039
instructional design

140
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,300
is instructional systems designer for

141
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,900
Live Nation uh entertainment I support

142
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,780
the Global Ethics and compliance group

143
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,199
under Emily's purview

144
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,460
and I

145
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,979
um some of the other roles that I've had

146
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:08,940
that really stand out in my memory uh is

147
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,600
a cyber manager at uh at the FBI Academy

148
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,780
at Quantico Virginia at the Hogan Sally

149
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,460
I don't know if you've ever heard of

150
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,680
that but it's a very exciting place it's

151
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,020
something that J Edgar Hoover had built

152
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,419
as the training grounds for all their

153
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,600
special AIDS special special agents and

154
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,759
during the day when we were working we

155
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,800
could see the helicopter store with body

156
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,780
parts in it and somebody knocking on

157
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,840
they had I like a little town built with

158
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,940
facades on the buildings and like the

159
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,699
post office a movie theater and some of

160
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:45,960
the guys that were in training were

161
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,240
pounding on the doors open up FBI all

162
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,740
that kind of thing it's very exciting

163
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,900
and then the other one that was most

164
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,180
exciting for me in all my years

165
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,340
uh this this industry was working for uh

166
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,380
as like Jimmy I did a lot of federal

167
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,900
federal government contracts in the BC

168
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,600
metro area and one this means that the

169
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,060
most is working for the Pentagon Forest

170
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,380
Protection Agency we serviced uh we made

171
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,960
sure that the all of the police officers

172
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,699
and all the other personnel there were

173
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,180
600 of them at the Pentagon had all of

174
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,340
their security awareness training on

175
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,979
time and making sure that you know they

176
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,599
got the correct training where they

177
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,160
needed it

178
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,400
um so that I'll tell you why I really

179
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,919
got into this a little bit later in

180
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,720
another questions would think I have a

181
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,060
better story to tell you about going in

182
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,759
time so thank you very much

183
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,060
yep so feel free if you guys have

184
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,220
questions oh I guess I don't need that

185
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,479
um if you guys have questions for our

186
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,340
panelists as we're going through the

187
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,979
conversation please toss them out

188
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,539
um you see we have a lot of different

189
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,880
backgrounds and experience which is what

190
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,220
we tried to do so that we could um give

191
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,500
you guys a prep or a right of of women

192
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,180
in technology

193
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,740
so

194
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,139
um I'll throw this out to anybody that

195
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,120
kind of wants to take it um what's the

196
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,360
importance of more women joining uh the

197
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,240
field of Technology

198
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,360
thank you

199
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,039
diversity and I know we all hear that a

200
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,860
lot these days but it offers I think

201
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,720
people as individuals and then also

202
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,919
different genders offer different

203
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,240
perspectives

204
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,099
um there's a lot of ways

205
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,319
my brain is

206
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,200
uh

207
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,059
everybody's brain works differently I do

208
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:36,958
think

209
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,479
um I think women offer so much more

210
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,219
perspective because

211
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,599
I don't know we can just think think

212
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,000
about things differently and there's a

213
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,260
funny little annotation that I have with

214
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,940
some family members and it's like my

215
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,459
brain I have 900 tabs in 14 different

216
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:53,040
browsers open at any given moment and

217
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,459
her husband he um my cousin says he has

218
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:57,959
like one at a time

219
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,600
not to say like he's slower or worse or

220
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,100
Dumber by any means he's a very

221
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,899
intelligent man but just I think there's

222
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,399
a multitasking element I've seen that

223
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,959
with women I've worked with that's the

224
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,040
different I've worked with a lot more

225
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,720
men than I have women frankly in this

226
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,500
business

227
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,120
um but that's one of the more notable

228
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,200
differences

229
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,279
um

230
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,800
yeah I think that's a big that's a huge

231
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,959
because and I'm I'm thinking like four

232
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,880
14 days down the road and they're like

233
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
on day negative two and I'm like hey

234
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,380
hold on I see where this is going

235
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,180
um I think that's an advantage and I

236
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,620
think

237
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,279
um

238
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,920
nope that's it I'll stop talking

239
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,440
anything

240
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,000
so one thing that I thought was

241
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
important about more women being in the

242
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,880
tech industry is just this feeling of

243
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,160
belonging in general whenever you see

244
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,440
other women in the tech industry because

245
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,260
it's really hard to feel like you belong

246
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,300
whenever you don't see other women in

247
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,320
the field

248
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,120
I feel like that's something that I've

249
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,160
noticed even like coming to conferences

250
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,040
and stuff like most of it's a majority

251
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,360
men

252
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,600
so it's just hard it's hard if you don't

253
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,339
see other women doing the same thing

254
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,959
that you are

255
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,760
yeah but it's nice when there's not a

256
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,820
line for the bathroom as well right

257
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,620
yeah I think it's really empowering to

258
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,180
have more women because like I probably

259
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,800
wouldn't be as far as I am right now if

260
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,300
I didn't have another woman in this

261
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,760
field would really push me farther so

262
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,620
yep

263
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,240
yeah I think it's interesting because

264
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,519
I'm I do a few different things I run

265
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,040
different teams for Live Nation and on

266
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,260
some of the teams I'm the only woman

267
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,420
right I'll get on on conference calls

268
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,920
with people around the world and I'm the

269
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,019
only woman and then on on other

270
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,000
conference calls like environmental

271
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,700
social governance ESG related calls it

272
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,360
it's all women right and it's it's

273
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,339
completely different Dynamic

274
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,800
um but I I agree with you Jimmy that um

275
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,560
just diversification overall not just in

276
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,440
gender right but just backgrounds

277
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,500
cultures all of that

278
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,220
experiences

279
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,680
um because if you get a room full of

280
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,140
people that have the same background the

281
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,300
same culture the same you're only going

282
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,760
to get so many solutions to problems

283
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,680
right they're going to come about it in

284
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,019
the same way but if you have people that

285
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,880
have different experiences and cultures

286
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,220
and backgrounds and and whatever then

287
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,839
then you're going to come up with some

288
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,160
unique

289
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,000
um

290
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,399
bring something to don't ever think for

291
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,440
two seconds that yours doesn't like you

292
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,839
can't do that

293
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,300
somebody tells you otherwise they are

294
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,199
wrong absolutely

295
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,899
all right anybody have any questions I

296
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,240
will move to my next one if not

297
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,600
sure

298
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,959
email

299
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,820
s

300
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,160
let me tell you that's pretty hard I

301
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,660
feel like especially being a black

302
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,000
female it's like you fit two you fit

303
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,040
like two little check boxes they're like

304
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,860
they're like

305
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,540
yeah you give us two boxes that's how it

306
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,060
feels sometimes it's really hard for me

307
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,480
sometimes to sit and reflect and be like

308
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,760
oh I actually do belong that's something

309
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,220
that's been very very hard

310
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,560
because in a lot of ways I feel like

311
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,140
they're it's something that people jump

312
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,240
to just because they're fitting A

313
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,800
diversity box

314
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,200
but then I sit down at the end of the

315
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,180
day and look at my qualifications and

316
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,860
realize that I'm just as qualified to be

317
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,460
there as anybody else heck yeah yeah

318
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,779
[Applause]

319
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,519
I'm just super honest about if I don't

320
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,720
know something or if I know something

321
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,399
I'm like listen

322
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,200
I know this like you have to have like I

323
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,339
don't know some confidence with that

324
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,740
right like if I know for sure that I

325
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,880
know something like I won't back down

326
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,620
from it if I think for a split second

327
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,880
that I don't know what I'm doing I'll be

328
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,620
the first person to tell you it's my

329
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,600
understanding that I start so many

330
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,760
sentences out with that and I'm like if

331
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,839
you want to teach me a different way

332
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,760
great love that

333
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,839
um

334
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,720
wait there was more of that

335
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,279
you've been up since what you had to be

336
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,100
here at six yeah forgive her

337
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,300
I just I think

338
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,440
well that and you're talking about the

339
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,139
Merit thing like I'm a more action speak

340
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,060
louder than words too and I'm like all

341
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,339
right well watch me do this like go

342
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:30,779
ahead and underestimate me and see how

343
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,279
that works out for you

344
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,060
that kind of thing

345
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,639
yeah I just and don't like put me into

346
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,740
like a project manager box because

347
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,459
um

348
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:42,959
I've had that happen several times

349
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,000
actually when you and I work together

350
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,399
um we're in the same building uh

351
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,240
oh that's where you were

352
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:55,399
did you get pushed into the boxes out

353
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,100
yeah okay yeah I went to yeah

354
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,700
um

355
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,200
if that's what you want to do great go

356
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,220
ahead it's just not my jam

357
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,139
um

358
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,779
foreign

359
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,540
problem solving and

360
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,940
the people the people also go in

361
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,620
sometimes my least favorite part also

362
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,019
but

363
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:27,600
yes right that's yeah that's fair very

364
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,380
fair

365
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,700
yeah

366
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,680
I do I just I really like at the end of

367
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,480
the day doing a really bang-up job doing

368
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,339
an awesome job and just knowing that

369
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:38,700
like man I fixed it like and I fixed it

370
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,199
well and things are running great like

371
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:41,579
that's like that gives me a lot of

372
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:42,540
satisfaction

373
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,880
yeah yeah anybody else want to answer

374
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,920
that I'd like to go ahead and go to the

375
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,660
next question because it's going to tie

376
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,459
in a lot of the things that we've been

377
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,320
discussing here if you don't mind Emily

378
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,060
yeah and that was the the strongest

379
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,160
biases for women

380
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,040
sorry why did you go into Brazil I'm

381
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,660
actually promised you that I would give

382
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,660
you that information right yeah so let

383
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,920
me tell you

384
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,860
my reason for going in going into

385
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,260
technology or Electronics or whatever it

386
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,019
was at the time was really strictly

387
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:14,240
survival

388
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,800
and a really great stroke of good luck

389
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,160
at 35 it was a single mom trying to

390
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,220
raise the kids still uh and no no

391
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,220
college degree not even a high school

392
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,560
diploma because I dropped out because my

393
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,339
parents like rent my stepfather

394
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:36,600
basically said you can't go to college

395
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,699
our neighbors wanted to support it and

396
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,680
pay for it and he said no so I dropped

397
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,360
out and got a job you know and got

398
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,860
married the whole thing you heard the

399
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,320
story before I'm sure

400
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,800
um but then one day I got a I got a

401
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,959
letter from Department of Labor

402
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,680
giving me this great opportunity to to

403
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,079
go and to matriculate in a program at

404
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,000
Ohio Institute of Technology it was

405
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,440
electric Electronics program for women

406
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,540
and that was something that I couldn't

407
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,100
refuse

408
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,540
so I

409
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,820
out of the blue it seemed like some just

410
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,260
somewhere out of the blue or got that

411
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,139
opportunity so I went ahead and started

412
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:19,800
the program and there were what 35 of us

413
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,760
I think in one class at a time and one

414
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,060
or two of us were females right so this

415
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,980
goes along with what you guys are saying

416
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,199
I didn't feel like I checked the box I

417
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,660
was still in survival mode trying to

418
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,600
learn new new subjects physics and

419
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,720
electron electricity and all of that the

420
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,380
main focus was was studying transistors

421
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,839
how they're made and that's really the

422
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,620
basics basis of how electronics are put

423
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,480
together to make a computer and make

424
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,399
these devices that we use so freely

425
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,120
today

426
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,100
and while this very interesting to me

427
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,860
and still is is the fact that it all

428
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,040
starts with a green off desert sand

429
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,799
and that's when I started and then from

430
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,040
that degree program I went ahead and

431
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,740
took a job with IBM and semiconductor

432
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,079
manufacturing where I actually learned a

433
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,720
lot more about how these computer chips

434
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,640
are made then

435
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,179
uh six years later I migrated West to

436
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,880
Silicon Valley to Intel on the biggest

437
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,419
one the biggest of all so I really got a

438
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,540
good education so strictly survival and

439
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,900
the need to have

440
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,120
some education was why I got into this

441
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,880
field I mean nothing about it so let me

442
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,980
tell you why kept me in the field that

443
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,900
was the two companies that I worked for

444
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,799
in Houston conductor area uh and at

445
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,000
Intel I worked in the factories making

446
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,400
the chips and finally migrated over to

447
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,460
HR in the training department and that's

448
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,320
when it became the systems administrator

449
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,520
for their

450
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,520
training and education database and it

451
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,080
was the Mainframe at the time think

452
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,559
about that so everybody was asking me

453
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,780
give me some reports I need data I need

454
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,520
to report a new report so I tell myself

455
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,000
how to write SQL to get data out on the

456
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,980
database I mean then we didn't have it

457
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,919
but then Along Came the bank on data

458
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,380
warehousing so we put all of our data

459
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,559
there right now we can buy tools to help

460
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,600
us get those data out and get into a

461
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,660
real pretty report so by virtue of me

462
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,059
taking the

463
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:35,220
incentive to teach myself that this new

464
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,200
program or this new skill I was I had

465
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,539
the opportunity to travel worldwide

466
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,820
sorry I haven't been using that have I

467
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,660
driving traveling worldwide teaching

468
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,460
Intel employees how to use these new

469
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,280
tools and I was on my own so it's

470
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,440
basically could have my own schedule my

471
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,200
own itinerary uh you know coming from

472
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,940
the hills of West Virginia in their

473
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,880
background at all in anything except for

474
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,160
raising kids and trying to make a make a

475
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,620
living uh then now I'm here I'm

476
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,660
traveling to Asia and getting you know

477
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:15,600
first class uh I hotels and fun trips

478
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,840
everything and as as I saw in foreign

479
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,080
countries probably more so the fact that

480
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,140
a woman was at their teaching especially

481
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,600
Electronics or anything to do with

482
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,360
technology was like mind-blowing to them

483
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,240
but fortunately for me they worked for

484
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,100
Intel Corporation things so they were

485
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,220
required to speak English and that was

486
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,919
the only thing that kept me going but uh

487
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,260
you know that was what really kept me in

488
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,900
going into business was not only

489
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,660
the the subject matter that I was

490
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,460
learning and could you actually use

491
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,140
but just being able to have the

492
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,700
opportunity to travel and all those

493
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,559
things too that's what grew up to liked

494
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,299
for me

495
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,780
thank you yeah

496
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,299
next question yeah so do you want to

497
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,160
repeat what you said before

498
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,360
sorry because I don't think the other

499
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,039
panelists got to answer that one yeah

500
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,679
what are you enjoy

501
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,919
ing here

502
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,720
what made you what made you want to be

503
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,480
and what you've enjoy you know if it was

504
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,400
a little bit different than why you went

505
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,860
in and why you liked it now but why you

506
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,039
said

507
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,780
um I think I say because I really like

508
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,520
to make a difference I don't really like

509
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,080
working with people who I like making a

510
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,020
difference for them

511
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:44,220
that's fair yeah yeah basically

512
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,299
so I kind of have a similar thing like

513
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,520
Hannah and I basically do like a lot of

514
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,780
the same things

515
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,700
like we're in the same internship and

516
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,120
same outside program so we both kind of

517
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,179
have like the same end goals I guess in

518
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,520
a lot of ways but I really do like

519
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,460
helping people I really do enjoy seeing

520
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,320
I feel like I like seeing the ending

521
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,340
product

522
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,520
of what I've learned like I love seeing

523
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,120
what I can do with my knowledge in

524
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,320
technology I feel like whenever like I

525
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,900
also have a love for the pen testing

526
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,100
side of

527
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,400
of our major and I love seeing Oh I can

528
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,980
hack this that that part is just really

529
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,659
cool to me

530
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:33,299
so yeah there's a whole career set in

531
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,580
ethical hacking you're in the right spot

532
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,840
yes absolutely absolutely so

533
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,039
um

534
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,740
so especially for you you students right

535
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,380
what trends do you see emerging in the

536
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,539
tech field or the the next five years

537
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,760
because it's I mean as Francine said

538
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,539
right she's seen where it kind of How

539
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,640
It's grown over her career from

540
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,039
mainframes and data warehouses and all

541
00:21:59,039 --> 00:21:59,940
that

542
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,159
what do you guys think is that you know

543
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,039
is going to be the next tech in 10 years

544
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,679
15 years that was a question I looked at

545
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,580
I was like

546
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,620
no yeah

547
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,679
yeah we're kind of talking a little bit

548
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,900
about this you make it oh that's exactly

549
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,980
right

550
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,419
Hannah and I were talking about this

551
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,559
before you came in here because

552
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,440
my mind immediately came to iot

553
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,140
forensics and how that's evolved and how

554
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,840
it's being more and more used in

555
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,900
forensic investigations so if you think

556
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,419
about it in Old forensic investigations

557
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:39,480
you only use like phones mostly or

558
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,000
laptops but now we're starting to see

559
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,960
watches being used where and

560
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,120
um also things like smart fridges Amazon

561
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,820
Alexa's and things like that being used

562
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,580
in investigations which is crazy if you

563
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,559
think about it just because that's

564
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:56,940
something we probably never thought was

565
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,860
going to be possible your refrigerator

566
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,260
is a rat

567
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,360
right like you never thought that your

568
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,220
refrigerator was going to be a snitch

569
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,860
exactly

570
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,980
but now it is and it's just it's crazy

571
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,600
thinking about how that's going to

572
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,600
evolve like how smart devices are going

573
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,000
to be more and more used

574
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,780
but I think right now there isn't too

575
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,960
much information on how to gain forensic

576
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,320
images from these like iot devices just

577
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,539
because it's so new like some stuff you

578
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:33,900
can some stuff you can't but I have a

579
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,340
feeling that they're going to be able to

580
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:40,039
get clear forensic images on those

581
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:47,460
I think uh with covid coming into play

582
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,020
I think a lot of people on it already

583
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,960
knew like remote work was fully a thing

584
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,880
um but I think everybody else in other

585
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,159
Industries have really kind of it's kind

586
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,480
of opened their eyes to be like oh wait

587
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,740
a minute we don't necessarily have to

588
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,360
have space and Facilities costs like we

589
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,220
can cut down on that or whatever

590
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,720
um so I think some of the Technologies

591
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,419
to make that remote telework kind of

592
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,480
life easier will develop further

593
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,140
um

594
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,940
oh there's something else I have to do

595
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,159
and I just forgot it

596
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,740
um well speaking of the the coveted bit

597
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,679
right so there was a lot of Health Care

598
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,960
related technology that had to Spur up

599
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,600
because of the pandemic as an example I

600
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,659
was in Mexico City in March right and it

601
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,720
was still locked down kind of semi right

602
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,880
you had to have vaccinations to go to a

603
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,120
show that kind of thing and um we

604
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,440
actually had

605
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,080
um cameras that measured temperature as

606
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,760
the crowd came in

607
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,340
because it's crowd control right and you

608
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,960
don't want to stop and do the little

609
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,880
thing and wait for it and all that so it

610
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,580
measures as it goes and it spots out and

611
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,700
it it like notifies folks well that

612
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,840
technology

613
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,340
it wasn't even there was it wasn't

614
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,039
needed yeah right it wasn't needed so it

615
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,559
could be that technology grows from

616
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,960
necessity which happens a lot sometimes

617
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,179
it's Innovative right and sometimes it's

618
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:07,740
necessity because the whole world shut

619
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,780
down we need to figure out how to be

620
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,659
able to do things again safely it's kind

621
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:13,980
of an adapt and overcome kind of thing

622
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,480
yeah exactly and that's the same thing

623
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,580
with the working at home model

624
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,220
we had to adapt to that every company in

625
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,559
the world had to figure out how to keep

626
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,320
going but without putting people in a an

627
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,720
office building anymore like we used to

628
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,120
safely keep going yeah yeah and that's

629
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,100
and that's actually a good

630
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,080
segue to a question that's not on our

631
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,260
list but

632
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,840
um what do you guys think the future of

633
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,700
work is going to look like because

634
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,919
coming out of the pandemic right there's

635
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,260
a lot of hybrid some people some

636
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,059
companies are putting people back in the

637
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:50,220
offices some companies are saying you

638
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,419
know what we're just going to stay with

639
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,279
the work at home model and some are a

640
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,740
little Blended what do you guys think

641
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,400
like five years from now workforces like

642
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,140
what's that going to look like I think a

643
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,159
lot of it depends on what industry

644
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,140
they're in um which is fair like me you

645
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,240
know I face the public so like we have

646
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,080
to be open to accept no clients

647
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,140
um but we also like we offer like two

648
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,179
telework days a month now first and that

649
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,580
wasn't even a thing like

650
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,100
this might shock some people anyway uh

651
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,320
years and years and years ago

652
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,799
they still had uh desktops with Windows

653
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:29,039
7 on it and I was like bruh what are we

654
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,100
doing yeah so I had to do a lot of

655
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,480
updating there

656
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,039
um so I think it's that kind of stuff

657
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,240
that people

658
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,520
it's like a user adaptation essentially

659
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,340
anybody can get used to anything frankly

660
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,020
um people are going to hate it or love

661
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,360
it but usually hate it

662
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,919
um but I think it depends on I think it

663
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,080
depends on the industry and like what

664
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,279
your you know your mission and all that

665
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,419
jazz is

666
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:54,059
um but I think we I think it could go

667
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:56,760
anywhere honestly yeah I do think it's

668
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,520
going to open up a lot of opportunity in

669
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,059
the technology field uh because I I work

670
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,220
in Los Angeles but I live here as an

671
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,440
example right Francine it doesn't matter

672
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,240
where you live in the world right you

673
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,360
can do your job yeah so you can move to

674
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,100
Cancun if you want to and she can still

675
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,600
do her job so I think there's going to

676
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,760
be more and more of that right right a

677
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,880
little Francine oh yeah

678
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,900
the the ethics of the person the work

679
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,179
ethic I mean you can tell very true the

680
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,740
person's been working at the company a

681
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,200
while they are always you can see what

682
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,080
their work ethic is like and uh you know

683
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,279
they take that home with them too

684
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,140
because when I first started working

685
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,679
from home uh any few years ago because

686
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,400
my role could could handle it

687
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,620
um I I would get up in the morning just

688
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,320
early just it's just you know ready for

689
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,419
work and just think what if the boss

690
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,100
stops by I want to make sure I'm working

691
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,620
you know if that was in my mindset no

692
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,059
matter where I am I'm going to be

693
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,799
feeling that way and and putting my best

694
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,440
foot forward I still get up I will work

695
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,260
from home for Emily Emily's in West

696
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,480
Virginia as well but we have colleagues

697
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,760
and clients all over well all over the

698
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,480
world and we support them uh and so it

699
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,760
really doesn't but I I think the

700
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,400
technology is going to change the way

701
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,140
that we do meetings and things like that

702
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,120
the way we meet face to face

703
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,980
be doing more training each other

704
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,779
through

705
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:30,600
different mediums online and I don't

706
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,100
know what it's going to be but I think

707
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,480
it's going to there's got to be better

708
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,900
ways than Zoom I think

709
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,760
yeah it's definitely a zoom exhaustion

710
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,620
right but that that could also be

711
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,100
additional Tech that comes out is

712
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,559
productivity software and or monitoring

713
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,500
for remote workers right

714
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,320
um and it yeah

715
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,880
um

716
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,860
oh yeah go for it sorry

717
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,020
you may want to take the question was

718
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,620
very softly spoken yes repeat the

719
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,440
question for the room what uh what are

720
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,380
our concerns with privacy issues

721
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,620
um in regards to productivity software

722
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,659
Etc et cetera tracking us and like our

723
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:32,940
logs and like daily tasks getting

724
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,159
monitored and that kind of thing

725
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,140
um

726
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,760
my thought kind of on that is if you're

727
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,659
just doing what you're supposed to do it

728
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:43,140
shouldn't be a big deal uh conversely

729
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,419
I don't like people helping my business

730
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:48,779
so it's kind of a double-edged sword

731
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:50,820
um I think

732
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,980
because there's bad apples that ruin the

733
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,899
whole bunch we have to kind of have that

734
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:56,159
thing

735
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,320
um and I hate that but

736
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,020
um my advice on that is honestly just

737
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,700
voice your opinion in like a respectful

738
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,799
way and you know if you're like hey me

739
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,360
and my team like we'll take care of our

740
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,980
stuff

741
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,760
um

742
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,279
maybe can we can slack off on the like

743
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,440
on this maybe it'll take you longer to

744
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,640
track what you're doing than do the

745
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,620
thing you're actually trying to do so I

746
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,820
just be honest about your opinions on

747
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,159
that and um yeah it's a concern like

748
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,659
bring it up

749
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:25,740
yeah so there there are a lot of um so

750
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,159
this is a field that is growing right

751
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:32,220
privacy and Technology right so if if

752
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,200
anybody has interests in that that

753
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,899
actually is a subset field right of

754
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:39,299
those uh making sure that the privacy

755
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:40,380
laws

756
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,899
are

757
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:45,179
followed in regard to technology the

758
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,399
internet of things all all the stuff you

759
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:48,539
just talked about

760
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:52,320
Alicia with the um your your TV and your

761
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,760
all that kind of stuff and what what's

762
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,559
it listening and what's it recording and

763
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,720
how long is it recording it where is it

764
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,399
going to and who's it being shared with

765
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,640
so um there there are several privacy

766
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,200
laws around the world there's a new one

767
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,820
rolling out in California that's going

768
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,820
to be across the U.S and there's a whole

769
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,360
Technology field behind that making it

770
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,760
run so information security and cyber

771
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,580
security intersect with privacy quite

772
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,620
heavily and that's a whole

773
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,659
specialization field that you could get

774
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:23,220
into if you're interested in that kind

775
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,500
of thing and I even it could be sorry

776
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,520
one second it could even be something

777
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,279
webcam covers like I have all my people

778
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,500
all my stuff I'm like I'm not spying on

779
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,659
you I don't want to frankly

780
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:34,919
um but cover it up when you're on a

781
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:36,179
meeting like it makes me feel better

782
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:37,500
makes them feel better like even if

783
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,940
something simple as that like it's you

784
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,080
know

785
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,640
um okay sorry that's all I just want to

786
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,100
add that yes sir you had a question

787
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,299
Market comments

788
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,899
Arizona you know you can't do forensics

789
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,700
yeah well it definitely has to be a

790
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,140
balance right because

791
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,340
um as she said there's always going to

792
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,960
be bad apples so you're always going to

793
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,380
have to investigate the law yeah and

794
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,640
that kind of breaches that contract a

795
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,480
little bit

796
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,100
well but there's

797
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,240
um

798
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,240
anything electronic right is gonna have

799
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,980
logs it's gonna have tracking it's gonna

800
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,899
have that so it's a matter of doing it

801
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,720
within the law but then also having the

802
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,240
ability to dig in if need to and

803
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,020
investigate when it's warranted so not

804
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,240
just open source you can go and look at

805
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,880
anybody's data at any time but if it's

806
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,779
if there is uh just cause to go in and

807
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:35,820
look at it and you follow the right

808
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,279
procedure then you can go in and do it

809
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,500
so there's there's

810
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,620
there has to be constraints right and

811
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,659
then there has to be a way because that

812
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:48,600
data is there to secure and encrypt and

813
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,539
protect that data so not anybody can get

814
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:55,080
to it right so it's it's nuanced but

815
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,659
you're you're right that if it was

816
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:00,120
completely locked down then there

817
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,860
wouldn't be a need for some forensics

818
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,299
but there's always going to be a need

819
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:04,440
because there's always going to be

820
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,820
somebody that's breaking the law or

821
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,500
doing bad things you're going to have to

822
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,039
investigate

823
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,260
so but if your business is doing certain

824
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,200
things if you're in finance or you're

825
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,419
processing credit card data you have to

826
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,820
log right so

827
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,500
um and that's why those mandates are

828
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,279
there yeah

829
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:32,240
all right yes

830
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:36,440
yeah let's go for it

831
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,220
well it's um that's the way the

832
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,019
technology world's going just in general

833
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:09,239
right is it's

834
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,820
um what are you collecting from who for

835
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,859
what purpose where is it stored where is

836
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:16,379
it transferred is it transferred

837
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:19,320
securely right who has access who's it

838
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,179
passed Downstream third parties fourth

839
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,040
parties so

840
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,139
um those things were already built into

841
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:28,560
privacy laws before right and now it's

842
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,899
just getting added to it's getting

843
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:32,940
tacked on to some stuff that it really

844
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,980
should have been tacked on to to begin

845
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,859
with so it's it's really the Journey of

846
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:40,379
the data right because it's it's your

847
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,480
personal data right the company that

848
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,300
you're transacting with don't own that

849
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:50,339
you own it but they uh uh monetize it on

850
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,020
your behalf right and they sell it to

851
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,820
third parties and whatever so it's

852
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,980
really just balancing that so that you

853
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,599
become the steward of your data again

854
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,940
oh yeah because most companies aren't

855
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,619
set up to do that so you have to

856
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:10,020
re-engineer you have to restock you have

857
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,880
to

858
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,040
reduce servers or switch to the cloud if

859
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,720
you're you know your data centers

860
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,859
couldn't handle

861
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:19,260
you know the the load that's needed to

862
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,780
to Really track the data you have to do

863
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,359
data mapping which a lot of companies

864
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:26,880
didn't build in from the beginning

865
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,040
yeah it's quite complicated sorry did

866
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,460
you have a question

867
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,640
before

868
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,160
great question yeah

869
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,900
you're gonna think about it yeah yeah

870
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,359
one thing that I realized whenever I go

871
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,160
back and speak to like my old high

872
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,619
school I kind of like to break the

873
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:10,680
stigma of Tech because I feel like the

874
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,180
reason why a lot of people don't get

875
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,980
into it is because they think that they

876
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,260
have to be for one really good at coding

877
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,000
and you don't have to be very good at

878
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,940
coding to do Tech I don't know like

879
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,520
honestly I know how to do it well enough

880
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,020
to do my job

881
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,440
but I'm not like super great at it and

882
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,359
that's one of the stigmas that I usually

883
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:32,880
try to break right away like you do not

884
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,680
have to and you also don't have to come

885
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,440
in knowing anything about technology

886
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,119
because I feel like a lot of people in

887
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,800
our field don't know anything coming

888
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,140
into their to the intro class and

889
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,660
there's nothing wrong with that like you

890
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,060
don't have to be a tech wizard in order

891
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:51,359
to start the field and you don't have to

892
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,000
be somebody that was super good with

893
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,040
tech growing up or anything like that

894
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,160
and you don't have to be good at coding

895
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,260
because I'm kind of I'm kind of average

896
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,099
at it if I'm being honest but I

897
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,260
but honestly it is a useful skill to

898
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,760
help I'm not going to say that you're

899
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,800
never going to have to do it because you

900
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,480
will but that's one thing that I always

901
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,180
tell them like hey if you can be a

902
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,099
beginner and come into this and then I

903
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:19,079
kind of discuss things like the cool

904
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:21,240
stuff that we get to do that's the

905
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:26,280
flashy part that gets to high schoolers

906
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,220
I don't want to tell people oh oh I code

907
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,619
all day tell them the end result of the

908
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:34,619
code tell them what you did like what

909
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:35,700
you did

910
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,220
in order like what you did with the code

911
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,420
I guess

912
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,859
because I

913
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,540
yeah because I feel like once they see

914
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,220
what they can do with the code I feel

915
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,599
like that's what makes code a little bit

916
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,880
more interesting for me like seeing what

917
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,520
I can do with it more so than the

918
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,930
process of doing it

919
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,980
[Music]

920
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,079
have any experience

921
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,920
a first generation student

922
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,359
life until I went to Marshall and like I

923
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,760
didn't know anything about any of it um

924
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,200
and I feel like I'm pretty successful

925
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,280
and I think it's really important to

926
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,599
share like success stories and

927
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,700
everything like that so and just Empower

928
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,200
them definitely reach out to them and

929
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,280
everything because they might not want

930
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,420
to do it

931
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,000
yeah I really like that you said you

932
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,740
were um going and speaking to your high

933
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,660
school I think that's

934
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,740
yeah exactly

935
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,680
um

936
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,060
kind of on her note of like you don't

937
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,560
have to really know anything like ask

938
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,480
all the questions like I still ask all

939
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,220
the questions every day

940
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,260
um like encourage them to do that and

941
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,500
just

942
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,420
um kind of like don't put anybody up

943
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,400
it's really hard to teach Society to not

944
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,900
do that so I think the more we

945
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,180
conversate about it and just keep having

946
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,560
that conversation over and over again

947
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,420
until it happens

948
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,200
um

949
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,119
give them my email I'll chat with him

950
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,859
all day I don't care

951
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:56,099
um I it yeah

952
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:58,079
talking to hospitals is great

953
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,460
um having I try to get a bunch of 12

954
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,540
year olds to come to this I was like God

955
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,099
I know it's like super nerdy but like it

956
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:05,520
could be fun I was like their stickers

957
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,380
um it didn't go well and plus they have

958
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,960
like school but whatever

959
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,079
um yeah just uh and I'm a big fan of

960
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,579
like they'll ask me something if I don't

961
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:15,780
know I'm like hang on I don't know but

962
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,099
let me research that or reach out to

963
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,560
somebody I know and let them like I'ma

964
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,200
send them her way 110 now

965
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,060
um now that we've met so yeah

966
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,359
to that I'll just add a couple of notes

967
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:32,640
um I I'm living proof that you don't

968
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,460
need to be knowledgeable in anything to

969
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,920
start out in this field and you learn as

970
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,619
you go but I think the main thing is to

971
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,839
be yourself don't try to be one of the

972
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,180
boys or one of the girls just be

973
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,760
yourself make sure you network with

974
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,060
those who do know things

975
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:54,180
stay in touch with them share ideas

976
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,420
whether it's in forums or 101s whatever

977
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,920
the case may be but stay in touch

978
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,320
also remain knowledgeable not not that

979
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,720
you need to do anything about them it's

980
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,740
just you know the latest buzzwords the

981
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,420
things that are going on in the world

982
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,640
just so you can you know answer a

983
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,099
question or two just so you're seen that

984
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:19,940
way so you're perceived as knowledgeable

985
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,920
uh remain marketable keep yourself

986
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,440
always this was a some good advice that

987
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,140
Andy Grove from Intel Corporation gave

988
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,240
me personally and I was in a training

989
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,380
room with them

990
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,200
we always make yourself marketable make

991
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,780
sure you know you know your resume is up

992
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,000
to date you use the right jargon the

993
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,880
right current information on it stay

994
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,160
current and everything even your looks

995
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,380
the way you dress all those things just

996
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:51,599
don't act or be seen as a person who is

997
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,420
uh

998
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:57,119
uncaring or unkempt just keep yourself

999
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,599
you know up to date and document all

1000
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:03,599
your ideas if you've got an idea don't

1001
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,359
just tell everybody document this person

1002
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:08,280
then let's say let's try it out let's

1003
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,619
see you know share it with others

1004
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:14,660
trademark trademark yes sir

1005
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,439
[Music]

1006
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,060
so because most of the time when I ask a

1007
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:39,900
question

1008
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,900
is

1009
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,000
happening to play games and stuff but I

1010
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,180
don't know

1011
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:01,540
[Music]

1012
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:12,119
what is your perspective

1013
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:15,980
to talk to the high school students

1014
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:19,920
I think one thing in middle school I had

1015
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,599
someone and I know this is more of an

1016
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,520
open source thing but they had a

1017
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,500
presentation where they showed like how

1018
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,640
much information they can pull from

1019
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,560
social media which is a really big deal

1020
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,900
for all of us so that's a good

1021
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,760
suggestion yeah it definitely caught my

1022
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,140
attention

1023
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,839
yeah that's a very yeah make it so that

1024
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:39,180
it it impacts them directly

1025
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:43,460
all right we are right at time any

1026
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,320
Shazam so any closing remarks or

1027
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,579
anything that you would like to leave

1028
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:50,280
the audience with as a

1029
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,839
um like advice that you would give

1030
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,640
yourself if you were just starting out

1031
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,000
in in technology let's wrap with that

1032
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,940
okay so the first thing that I would say

1033
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,240
to myself is to not be intimidated

1034
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,119
whenever you're the only girl in the

1035
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:09,060
room like I feel like it's just weird

1036
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,500
whenever you walk into the room

1037
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,420
sometimes and you're the only girl and

1038
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,760
then I'm the only black girl so you kind

1039
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,260
of start to question your sense of

1040
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,540
belonging sometimes but like I said

1041
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,900
before now it's not as big of a deal for

1042
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,819
me I know that I belong in the room with

1043
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:27,780
everybody else don't feel like I would

1044
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,780
also tell myself to not feel like I

1045
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,480
don't belong because I feel like a lot

1046
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,980
of times too when you're women in

1047
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,500
technology people don't really think

1048
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,200
that you know as much as a man that is

1049
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,740
the biggest pet peeve for me like

1050
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,540
whenever they think that you can't do

1051
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,880
your job or you're not as qualified as

1052
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,740
somebody who ran through the same major

1053
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,940
same qualifications you're just a fan

1054
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:57,839
and they talk to you as if you know

1055
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,640
nothing

1056
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,260
so

1057
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,760
yes don't do that

1058
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:08,579
and try be

1059
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,740
showing them that you do know it's

1060
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,200
unfortunate that we have to do that but

1061
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,819
showing them that you do know what

1062
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,380
you're talking about that you do belong

1063
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:21,300
that you do know just as much or more

1064
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,020
than your male counterpart and honestly

1065
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,420
just staying confident whenever you know

1066
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,640
that like this is a male dominated field

1067
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,160
and it has been for a while just know

1068
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,900
that like we're trying to break the

1069
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,560
barrier and everything right now but

1070
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,940
to stay confident

1071
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,319
thank you Felicia for saying that how

1072
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:51,839
you feel as a black woman and or any

1073
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,160
woman in the tech field uh I have some

1074
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,900
of the same

1075
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,579
um kind of

1076
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:03,119
feelings about ageism

1077
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,400
as an older

1078
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,300
white or older woman in the field I

1079
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,839
sometimes feel as the same feelings only

1080
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:14,339
different you know just account

1081
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:16,500
different bias if you will

1082
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,880
so it's there folks it's uh the gendered

1083
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:24,060
ageism is relevant in today's world in

1084
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,099
fact it's the biggest bias in the tech

1085
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:29,180
field right now that that there is

1086
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,819
including the the salary uh the salary

1087
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:34,920
gap between the females and the male

1088
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,980
that still exists too but just you know

1089
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,800
