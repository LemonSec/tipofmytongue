1
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,480
so thank you for coming today uh today I

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,860
want to talk about zero trust which is

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,780
probably the most not the most exciting

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,760
thing but it's also not the most

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,960
complicated thing and we're going to

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,800
talk about basically how simple it is

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,400
um so I'm Bill Gardner

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,619
here we go

9
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:30,720
and uh I'm a Libra

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,239
um like long walks on the beach

11
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:34,920
I mean this associate professor at

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,620
Marshall University is named interim

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,000
chair program director of the

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,200
undergraduate

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,140
programs if you want to talk about

16
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,640
furthering your career through education

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,100
we are I'm currently in process of

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,300
getting both the undergraduate and

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,520
graduate programs online

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,219
so we can have folks who aren't living

21
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:57,539
in Huntington

22
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,539
available the program available to you

23
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,219
all

24
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,559
so what is uh zero trust does anyone

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,560
want to take a stab at that

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,880
you don't trust anything on the inside

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,979
okay well good job I'll see y'all later

28
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,280
zero trust architecture

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,020
you are correct you don't trust anything

30
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,880
on the inside for those who didn't hear

31
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,199
it anyone else

32
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,020
anybody Buehler Bueller oh thank God you

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,479
all get my jokes did you ever back there

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,159
you don't rely up on any other layers of

35
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,920
security so we'll go through this

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,000
uh zeratrust is a framework

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,880
it's not a product so if somebody tries

38
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,320
to sell you something say it's General

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,979
gyro zero trust it's basically snake oil

40
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,920
it's not a matter of a specific product

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,880
is going to fix all your problems

42
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,460
it's no better in a blinky light box you

43
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,140
know those things we put in our networks

44
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,240
to protect us from Advanced cyber

45
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,840
hacking stuff

46
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:11,940
what

47
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,840
so it's a matter of implementing a

48
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,980
framework and it isn't a specific

49
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,120
product

50
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,760
it's focused on tailored controls micro

51
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,440
coroners perimeters and trusting nothing

52
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,599
so what happens to most of our

53
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,120
environments

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,180
do uh you know people don't attack

55
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,340
through the firewall

56
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,500
well some people do but most people are

57
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,959
using fishing or some other method of

58
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,000
getting inside your network without any

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,540
of your parameter stuff seeing it

60
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,300
the ooey gooey middle I think is what

61
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,160
they these people called it in the past

62
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,720
you got the country outside of the

63
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,519
cookie and you got the ooey gooey middle

64
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,560
on the inside so

65
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,540
um zero trust was founded by forged

66
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,340
Forester and I think there's an extra R

67
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,900
in Forester

68
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,180
anyway we were not grading on uh

69
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,519
spelling today and implemented by Google

70
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,580
and it's been around for about a decade

71
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,319
but it's a top it's a hot topic now

72
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,260
because basically we still suck at

73
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,879
security

74
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,620
foreign

75
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,780
we spend more and more money on security

76
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,420
and we get worse every year the last

77
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,340
breach was the biggest breach

78
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,099
and why are 99.9 of those breaches

79
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,800
social engineering

80
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,500
so one of the things that zero trust

81
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,260
tries to do is to limit the blast radius

82
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,440
um that I think that was what we when we

83
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,360
briefed some three-letter agencies on

84
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,459
white paper we did on this I think that

85
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:48,959
was the term I used because it was

86
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,720
something they could understand

87
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,260
um

88
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,780
you're trying to limit the damage if

89
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,459
there is a breach somebody gets inside

90
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,200
your network it's a hot topic now

91
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,760
because it's being built into

92
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,340
regulations

93
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,680
and there's going to be requirements by

94
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,420
the federal government to implement it

95
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,940
by a specific time I forget what that is

96
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,099
but it's very soon

97
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,019
also more people are working remotely

98
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,299
cause of code 19.

99
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,139
uh

100
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,820
and we continue to be in this sort of

101
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,340
hybrid work situation

102
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,380
uh we were talking about at Marshall

103
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,419
about oh we can't wait to go back to our

104
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,220
face-to-face meetings well we found out

105
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,259
a lot of people don't have time for

106
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,120
face-to-face meetings and hybrid works

107
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,380
better for them

108
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,240
so we're still kind of in a hybrid work

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,919
environment where people are using the

110
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,380
internet more sometimes they're using it

111
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,880
from their house

112
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,040
from a computer uh that you have no

113
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,900
control of

114
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,280
um

115
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,380
so that's one of the reasons another

116
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,560
reason for zero trust it doesn't mean

117
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,960
you need to add more security friction

118
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,199
nobody wants more security friction

119
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,960
it means it just means you need to move

120
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,720
remove trust from the network

121
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,460
you don't trust everything on the

122
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,080
network by default

123
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,360
basically every time

124
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,080
service touches a resource

125
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,639
it needs to authenticate again

126
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,419
when you remove trust from the network

127
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,000
you must gain confidence in your users

128
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,160
devices and service

129
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,139
and the basically the way you do that

130
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,360
is by knowing your users devices and

131
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,220
services does everyone know how many

132
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,660
computers there are on their network

133
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,240
does everyone have a good

134
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,520
idea of all the users on your network

135
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,860
the bigger the network of course the

136
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,620
harder it is and then you have to have

137
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,520
something

138
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,860
that manages the identities of both

139
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,539
users services and devices

140
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,960
an identity can represent a user a human

141
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,560
a service software process or a hardware

142
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,180
device

143
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,180
and each should be uniquely identifiable

144
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,900
and cryptographically verifiable in a

145
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,880
zero trust architecture so what does

146
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,419
that mean

147
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,039
this is interactive uh presentation

148
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,460
valve

149
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,400
right just in time access so

150
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,340
every time

151
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,319
you basically anytime you touch

152
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,900
something on the network it's being

153
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,539
identified cryptographically as

154
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,360
something you could trust

155
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,580
does that make sense sometimes I think I

156
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,319
like make up analogies that only make

157
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,039
sense to me

158
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,960
um the worst was when I taught Network

159
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,479
protocols and I was like

160
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,180
so it's like a bowling alley and somehow

161
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,160
I came up with a complete analogy that

162
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,259
made sense to me but not to anyone else

163
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:53,340
so anyway

164
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,400
um

165
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,539
so the first thing you do is you're

166
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,419
going to complete a discovery exercise

167
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,460
of your network so you can identify all

168
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,139
the pieces of your network whether

169
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,039
they're human software Hardware

170
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,840
and you put all this into a directory

171
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,360
create the accounts

172
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,979
and then link the individuals

173
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,139
upgraded my Mac and now acts weird

174
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,599
each identity should be assigned a role

175
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,180
and that role should be least privileged

176
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,039
so Emma what's the least privileged

177
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,259
that's right so one of my graduates in

178
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,840
the back there very good Brian

179
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,360
so people should only have the amount of

180
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,520
privilege uh that they need to do their

181
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,220
job nothing more so another this is new

182
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,680
if you are heard anything new in this at

183
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,860
all

184
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,240
directory needs to be compatible with

185
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,280
all services within architecture no

186
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,060
matter where they are accessed from and

187
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,360
there is no single source of identity

188
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,039
and sign on for the user

189
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,979
so the whole idea is to eliminate

190
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:15,720
friction from this

191
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,520
um whole idea that you have to keep

192
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,319
authenticating over and over and over

193
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,479
again you don't want to add friction at

194
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,340
all you just want it to be so that

195
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,780
things aren't trusted

196
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,300
until they can be trusted based upon

197
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,580
the trust that you put in the user or

198
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,320
the device

199
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,979
so create dual groups

200
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:40,380
defined roles that have been configured

201
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,760
your least privileged

202
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,219
support strong and modern methods such

203
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,959
as multi-factor and passwordless

204
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,480
architecture

205
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,519
so is everyone uses Pew Factor at this

206
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,620
point

207
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,360
finally

208
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,459
two factors been around for years and

209
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:57,959
the fact that

210
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,120
I think my bank got it

211
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,260
a couple years ago

212
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,180
uh and also what what is passwordless

213
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,100
Arc authentication anyone I want to take

214
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,720
a stab at that

215
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,640
I don't have any prizes I'll uh how

216
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,080
about this I'll give you this microphone

217
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,899
if you can

218
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,519
and you can rap too go ahead

219
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,839
email is one of them like in my MacBook

220
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,660
here I have fingerprint

221
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,899
so I guess you cut my finger off if you

222
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,120
wanted to break into my computer the

223
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,459
idea with security is you can't

224
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,800
eliminate risks but you try to manage

225
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,760
risk yes sir

226
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,860
yeah

227
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,279
what he just said I would restate it but

228
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,040
I'll probably get it backwards so it's

229
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,480
what you know

230
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,399
who you are and what you have is that

231
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,279
correct I got it right

232
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,320
okay I'm remembering it's what you know

233
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,180
from that so yeah exactly sorry

234
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,820
um

235
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,959
I mean there's a lot of reading here I

236
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,940
hate the read slides so uh we go ahead

237
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,320
and read this I'm going to take a sip of

238
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,500
coffee

239
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,640
foreign

240
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,160
securely provisioned credentials to user

241
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,100
enable Federated access can you tell me

242
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,420
what Federate access is

243
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,480
or or a group of services to trust each

244
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,279
other you know so you've got single

245
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,940
sign-on at Marshall that's an example of

246
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,459
Federated access open ID connect there's

247
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:48,079
a bunch of different things out there

248
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,940
right

249
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,019
and hopefully it works

250
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,700
um support your your joiners movers

251
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,820
levers processes so this is one of the

252
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,240
things that really gets my goat

253
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,040
when I used to work in law firms they

254
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,200
would fire people and let them sit there

255
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,420
at their computer and look for another

256
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,279
job

257
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,079
in the meantime they have complete

258
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:16,260
privileges through the entire network

259
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,300
they could have basically deleted

260
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,560
everything

261
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,140
and nothing would have happened so the

262
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,820
question becomes in the case of zero

263
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,820
trust you have to have a framework what

264
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,560
do you do when someone comes into your

265
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,739
network

266
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,600
what's the process

267
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,339
and when they leave the network

268
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,899
um we still do that with students I

269
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:40,680
think

270
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,700
I think you have your account for life

271
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,560
your email account at least maybe not

272
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,920
login

273
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,839
so and then the the other thing with the

274
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,060
Federated ID accepting identities from

275
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,160
other trusted third-party user

276
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,939
directories

277
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,380
so basically what you're going to see

278
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,380
here is this is all

279
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,560
managed around

280
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,940
basically directories of users

281
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,760
processes and

282
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,880
devices so how do you knock this over

283
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,380
well if you can uh if you have some way

284
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,260
of compromising the directory

285
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,779
that has all the keys to all these

286
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,360
things that is a problem

287
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,040
and when we were talking about this this

288
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,800
people uh who work in the Beltway well

289
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,380
actually outside the Beltway closer to

290
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,240
Baltimore

291
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,160
um one of the things they said was that

292
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,079
there's still this flaw even though you

293
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,760
do all this stuff

294
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,980
okay there's a fall on everything

295
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,620
has anyone ever seen Dave Kennedy

296
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,420
Dave Kennedy used to do a talk called

297
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,720
building a mature security program

298
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,100
that's all this is

299
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,380
knowing where your stuff is

300
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,260
a big part of it knowing what you're

301
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,139
doing with your users and your data is a

302
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:08,940
big part of it all they've done

303
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,680
basically is build a framework around it

304
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,300
and put a pretty bow on top

305
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,519
and then also mapping uh data roles I

306
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,220
think I've said this 15 000 times in

307
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,399
different ways also uh mapping workflows

308
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,440
Define roles access Authentication

309
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,980
glyphic clear picture on how Dana moves

310
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,880
and access is accessed

311
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,079
identity management again this is what

312
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,459
we're talking about which is sort of a

313
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,040
problem

314
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,079
and so who

315
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,200
who's this your source of Truth is is

316
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,940
who who's your source of Truth in

317
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,660
identity management

318
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,440
I'm covering this episode we can't read

319
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,779
the slide

320
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,399
HR

321
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,260
HR knows everyone who works there right

322
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,720
HR should know everyone's role

323
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,940
this also can be a problem because HR

324
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,620
can be targeted

325
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,320
for especially fishing but um

326
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,120
yeah you're going to rely up on HR

327
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,120
there's also Insider threats never trust

328
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,339
always verify verify the time of

329
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,260
assignment and verify at the time of

330
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,579
access those are two different

331
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,579
verifications

332
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:24,480
and uh without reading a complete uh

333
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,820
nist document to you do you all have any

334
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,360
further questions

335
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,800
no questions

336
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,000
oh I got three questions okay

337
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,540
go ahead

338
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,420
that's a problem then it doesn't work it

339
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,139
just doesn't work

340
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,360
yeah I mean that's just it if you don't

341
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,459
have a good identity management going on

342
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,139
here

343
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,959
um it's not gonna work you got to build

344
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,240
those systems for the rest of the system

345
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,579
to work yes you had a question

346
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,300
shh

347
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,519
is there anyone here from my old law

348
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,420
firms

349
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,279
no I don't think so great go ahead

350
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,279
yeah that's a good question

351
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:38,940
um

352
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,839
and

353
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,480
yeah well sometimes I mean the base is

354
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,959
based on their role too so the identity

355
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,639
is somebody that works uh as a male

356
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:54,959
runner is going to be different than

357
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,959
identity who's a managing partner

358
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:02,279
um in this case they were secretaries uh

359
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:05,220
so they had well

360
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,339
so this is a long story so bear with me

361
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:09,060
um

362
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,980
because the way we had to configure a

363
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,279
bunch of stuff everyone was local admin

364
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,459
so that breaks zero trust right there

365
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:18,899
but I understand what you're saying if

366
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,560
someone were able to steal

367
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,060
their identity

368
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,680
then they could just walk across the

369
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,320
network that's true that is a flaw and

370
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,920
zero trust

371
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,800
um I guess the one thing you'd have to

372
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,839
do is

373
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:41,100
put Biometrics maybe into it some way

374
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,860
I know we all have unlimited budgets to

375
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,060
do that

376
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,639
and we have unlimited budgets to build

377
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,820
this stuff out

378
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,800
this is an example of regulators going

379
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,019
oh that's a great idea implement it

380
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,759
tomorrow

381
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,820
for everything DOD

382
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,000
uh you know all federal agencies oh so

383
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,439
we're going to get the states to do it

384
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,439
too while we're at it no budget

385
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,919
uh and it takes a lot of work to do this

386
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,579
yes

387
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,520
yes they do

388
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,299
it's not perfect

389
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,539
right

390
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:41,880
You Know It uh doesn't feel open so

391
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,700
yeah yeah so yeah there's I mean there's

392
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,679
a problem with everything I'm not here

393
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,780
to even defend zero trust I'm just

394
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,179
trying to bring awareness to the fact

395
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,340
that it exists it's a great idea but how

396
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,780
you implement it like everything else is

397
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,280
how it's going to work

398
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,440
and a lot of it is going to take time

399
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,860
and money

400
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,559
now that I've depressed everyone yes sir

401
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,320
foreign

402
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,880
well you know I think Sans has some very

403
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,220
good they had uh

404
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,740
actually went to a sand Summit on zero

405
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,900
trust where there was a lot of good

406
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,000
information and then

407
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
this has their own documents if you you

408
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,260
know if you're having problem sleeping

409
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,360
uh you gotta look at the missed

410
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,059
documents but

411
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:47,580
um there are also companies that claim

412
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,919
to sell zero trust one of the things you

413
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,660
can look at that and sort of compare it

414
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,360
to what else you can find

415
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,980
but there I don't think there's one true

416
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,260
source of what zero trust is it's I

417
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,520
think it's also based upon

418
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,400
interpretation and how it's implemented

419
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,679
again it's a framework it's not a

420
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,980
product

421
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:12,419
you all missed my shmukh Khan talk about

422

guarding your cyber apt in the cloud

423
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,260
didn't you

424
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,080
completely troll talk but anyway I'm not

425
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,940
here to troll I'm not here to bury zero

426
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,640
trust nor the praise it but it's an

427
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,559
interesting topic but then again it's

428
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,080
just a matter of building a mature

429
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,240
security program
