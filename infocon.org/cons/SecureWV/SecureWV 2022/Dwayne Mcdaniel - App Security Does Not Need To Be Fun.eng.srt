00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,060
need to be fun ignoring no wash but have

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,039
a terrible time as I explained to Tommy

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,039
here I thought of the title first and I

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,720
wrote this talk in the last two weeks

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,460
when I got accepted to this conference

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,900

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,100
happy to talk to you so quick plug I

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,239
work for a company called git Guardian

24
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,159
I'll start out just saying I'll mention

25
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,780
them later as well because we're a gold

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,720
sponsor of owasp so you'll see that come

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,280
up again later but

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,799
um get Guardian is a company that

29
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,580
focuses on secret uh secret leakage

30
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,979
detection and mitigation if you're

31
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,600
hardcoding your secrets or someone's

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,979
heart code and secrets somewhere in your

33
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,960
org and they're pushing that somewhere

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,060
you should probably be aware of that and

35
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,740
that's what we help people do very

36
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,259
recently we've introduced um internet uh

37
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,000
infrastructure as code scanning scanning

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,100
for most common vulnerabilities and we

39
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,720
have awesome open source Tools around

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,759
that so check it out I also have

41
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,439
stickers for these uh for this company

42
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,000
if you want stickers

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,860
come up and get them afterward and

44
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,380
screen covers so if you want to webcam

45
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,420
cover I got a few of them left

46
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,040
all right so

47
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,100
who here is a security professional that

48
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,520
who here consider themselves a developer

49
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,040
awesome that's who I wrote The Talk for

50
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,079
uh who here is actually a member oh wasp

51
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,258
already

52
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,900
what's that

53
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,400
was my next question but first was

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,040
member who's a member of owasp all right

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,660
nowhere hands went up for those of you

56
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,819
watching home and uh who uses the oasp

57
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,739
tools in some capacity

58
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,819
a few hands went up

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,959
so

60
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,459
what does good security actually look

61
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,739
like I think it looks like this

62
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,599
pager's not going off

63
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,300
you're very confident that nothing's bad

64
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,340
is going to happen by the morning unless

65
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,840
you know something does but you're

66
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,099
confident that you can sleep through the

67
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,860
night and going away on a camping trip

68
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,900
that was the keynote this morning said

69
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,000
they went camping right before came to

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,019
this event

71
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,760
you got time to do that you got time to

72
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,800
go to concerts and not worry like I'm

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,000
gonna have to leave in the middle before

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,040
the headliner actually comes on because

75
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,620
we're gonna have an incident

76
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,060
what really comes down I think to this

77
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,500
that you have that personal time to

78
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,420
spend with the people you love

79
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,940
that's what good security looks like in

80
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,860
my opinion in my world view I come from

81
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,660
the devops space and Drupal and

82
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,900
WordPress

83
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,080
everything we do has a human cost to it

84
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,180
not just a financial cost not just a

85
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,440
technical cost

86
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,720
but it comes down to a human cost

87
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,780
and that's the underlying message I'm

88
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,220
not going to talk about that a whole lot

89
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,540
but that's the underlying message of the

90
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,620
rest of this talk

91
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,300
of like how to not have a terrible time

92
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,879
because what does bad security look like

93
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,860
well unfortunately I don't have like

94
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,959
three pictures that paint that just as

95
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,840
well as those first few did because all

96
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,280
unhappy families are a little bit

97
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,019
different but let's talk about if you

98
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,780
want happy families out there uh who

99
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,340
heard about this Toyota

100
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,220
I'm proud to say I got a top of Hacker

101
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,659
News for about eight hours because I

102
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,519
wrote a piece on this

103
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,099
um they had a subcontractor push part of

104
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,260
their t-connect repo

105
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,140
to a public repo uh and it contained a

106
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,280
key to a data server that had 2000 296

107
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,500
0019 customers data in it

108
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,540
not a good day I did not sleep through

109
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,400
the night on that one oh yeah it was it

110
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,780
was exposed for five years before they

111
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,579
figured it out they have no idea who has

112
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,660
this

113
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,839
uh cash app who's heard of this one

114
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,880
it was a fun one Discerning employee

115
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,160
they forgot to turn on and forget they

116
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,199
didn't have policy to turn off their

117
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,960
rights came back later stole all the

118
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,440
data for all their users

119
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,139
Uber this one probably everybody's heard

120
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:37,860
of

121
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,660
yes uh lapsis uh a teenager broke this

122
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,540
to the New York Times said hey I pwned

123
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,820
uh opponed Uber

124
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,280
and that's how it broke he said look at

125
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,780
all this data I have look at all these

126
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,699
systems I came into look at I got in

127
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:54,960
through everything because they hard

128
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,360
coded into Powershell scripts all the

129
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,800
credentials I needed

130
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,240
didn't do anything with it other than

131
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,699
embarrass them that we know of we don't

132
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,020
know what lapses actually did with it

133
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,540
unlike Samsung where lapse has dumped it

134
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,240
all said here's 160 gigs of Samsung's

135
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,919
data including the source code for

136
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,419
Galaxies

137
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,940
and six over six thousand secrets to get

138
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,160
into the rest of their systems

139
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,979
after them not attributed lapses

140
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:23,280
uh they realized hey someone's stolen

141
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,919
all of our customer data I think it's

142
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,479
directly related to this but they've

143
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,039
never confirmed that it is

144
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,720
they're not even saying what exactly

145
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,759
they stole they just say something got

146
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,320
stolen but maybe one of the biggest

147
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,060
unhappy families out there is Apache

148
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,000
users unfortunately uh thanks to log for

149
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,900
shell

150
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,220
I don't think we need to say a lot about

151
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,840
that but that affected so much of the

152
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,960
internet

153
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,479
everybody involved in that then had to

154
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,699
scramble and have some sleepless nights

155
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,620
and couldn't go camping and couldn't go

156
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,240
to concerts because they had to fix this

157
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,520
they had to figure out how to mitigate

158
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,620
the problems from that

159
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,000
threats are only increasing out there

160
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,740
day to day that's what one thing you've

161
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,800
heard repeatedly here at securewb

162
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,840
and security teams are outnumbered but

163
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,000
maybe not in the way you're thinking

164
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,500
I don't think there are more hackers

165
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,199
than there are are any more black hat

166
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,539
hackers than there are uh people on Red

167
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,220
teams and blue teams and you know people

168
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,020
trying to do good

169
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,940
what where security people are

170
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,319
outnumbered is inside their own

171
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,620
organizations uh security at security at

172
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,340
conference on to Al Trace recently said

173
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,639
um in the best organizations it's 101 of

174
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,300
developers two security people

175
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,639
so what do we do

176
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,800
this is shift left make everybody on the

177
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,139
security team then this fixes that

178
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,460
problem doesn't it

179
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,680
that'd be great that's what shifting

180
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,020
left can mean I think shifting left is a

181
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,479
bad term personally because I see it so

182
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,220
poorly abused

183
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,120
smearing left or um uh

184
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,979
what's it spreading left is spreading

185
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,720
left is the word that I heard that I

186
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,220
kind of like that one because it spread

187
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,479
the knowledge around and that's what it

188
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:06,360
was supposed to do because if we keep

189
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,300
sliding everything left like everything

190
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,979
left eventually the developer is the

191
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,360
only people doing anything and they

192
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,100
already have a lot to do they got

193
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,380
deliverables they're fighting bugs they

194
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,699
have to figure out devops now they're

195
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,080
fighting kubernetes day in day out

196
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,300
that's a whole industry if you ask most

197
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,039
devops people what they do like

198
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,599
kubernetes is somewhere in their

199
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,039
description of what they do day to day

200
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,660
nobody understands it how many people

201
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,919
write it I think

202
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,259
it's not so much time

203
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,479
unfortunately as well from the business

204
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,060
perspective a lot of business people

205
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,680
I've talked to in my life kind of have

206
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,360
this view of security

207
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,280
it's like yeah we gotta fix the last

208
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,599
thing that broke

209
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:43,919
oh wait a minute let's slowed everything

210
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,800
down we gotta speed back up again wait a

211
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,300
minute that caused an incident

212
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,860
and we're in this endless loop

213
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,419
but you can just throw a tool at it if

214
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,400
you figure out which tool to throw at it

215
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,699
uh again this is a developers who were

216
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,500
kind of on their own like hey you you

217
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,000
were gonna worry about security now you

218
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,660
build that into your deliverables

219
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,360
we're done no no if I as a somebody that

220
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,919
used to be ex sales I could tell you

221
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,900
that my tool will always be the thing

222
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,180
that solves most of your problems

223
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,039
but in reality there's so many tools and

224
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,080
so many sales people yell on that you

225
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,460
don't know what to do

226
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,020
so I think

227
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,000
this is what a lot of people have talked

228
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,620
to a lot of people in the last few weeks

229
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,120
last few months of my life I've talked

230
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,099
to feel like this or feel like the Red

231
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:29,879
Queen

232
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,159
you got to run as fast as you can just

233
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,958
to stay where you are

234
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,640
to get ahead you got to run at least

235
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,500
twice that fast

236
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,000
if you're not ever read through looking

237
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,500
glass and what Alice found there it's

238
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,458
the second book in the Alice series uh

239
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,420
uh probably you're familiar with the

240
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,100
first one in Alice Wonderland uh those

241
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,180
are two of my favorite books ever

242
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,260
written it's a bunch of wonderful

243
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,720
nonsense pull them out

244
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,440
um

245
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,980
so right now if you're a developer and

246
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,959
you're just reminding your I've reminded

247
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,580
you like yes this is the world I live in

248
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,959
you might be thinking yeah I wish there

249
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,100
was just a benevolent group of

250
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,839
superheroes that could just help me with

251
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,980
this stuff

252
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,100
turns out there is called a wasp uh the

253
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,380
largest non-profit focused on security

254
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,779
in the world uh

255
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:16,440
stands for open web application security

256
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,980
project

257
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,140
mission is very simple

258
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,360
no more insecure software

259
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,620
in a perfect world that's what they

260
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,880
would actually accomplish this is

261
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,080
actually their full mission statement

262
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,660
it's kind of long I'll let you read it

263
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,779
but really it boils down to of just a

264
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,220
few things that they do

265
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,959
and there's these things they got

266
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,519
projects they focus on communities

267
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,339
events education training publication

268
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,380
resources

269
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,480
projects is the heart of everything this

270
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,420
is the main thing I think owass is known

271
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,459
for they make all these awesome projects

272
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,899
that do a bunch of things we'll break

273
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,040
down a little bit more in the next

274
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,560
slides but uh every one of them has a

275
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,480
repo attached

276
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,640
volunteers and experts are contributing

277
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,560
their own time and resources to make

278
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,940
these happen

279
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,940
uh there are 242 at current count but

280
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,920
that number keeps going up and they're

281
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,440
149 in usable States when I say usable

282
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,180
States they're in one of these four

283
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,140
categories uh Flagship which is well the

284
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,060
best biggest most supported best

285
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,380
documented

286
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,360
production is a new category as of

287
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,640
October uh nothing's in it yet because

288
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,560
it's a brand new category and there's a

289
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,120
process to get into it that means it's

290
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,320
production ready and you should feel

291
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,420
confident running in production of

292
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,980
course to say that with confidence you

293
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,420
got to go through a process and no one's

294
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,980
done it yet it's too new lab projects

295
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,120
they're not Flagship projects but

296
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,560
they're still pretty good in computer

297
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,080
projects are on their way to lab

298
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,459
um

299
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:47,700
flagships though are a designation to

300
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,800
give projects that have demonstrated

301
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,839
strategic value

302
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,380
labs are on their way there

303
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,060
oh yeah those numbers that's why I made

304
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,220
these slides uh 18 uh flagships right

305
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,940
now

306
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,160
uh 34 lab projects

307
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,800
and 97 incubators everything else is on

308
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,240
its way there it needs documentation

309
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,680
you're looking to get involved in open

310
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,959
source

311
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,360
here are over 100 projects that would

312
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,339
love your help

313
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,740
and as we get further down on that stack

314
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,800
flagships are very general very big very

315
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,880
Broad

316
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,279
Labs a little more specific a little

317
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,220
more like OAS podcast project for

318
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,959
instance they make a podcast that's what

319
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,279
they do

320
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,360
um

321
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,180
uh the incubators are very specific and

322
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,279
they start getting into the weeds of

323
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,660
what you want to get done with security

324
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,360
and that's a lot so they mapped it out

325
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,100
they said Hey how do you know which one

326
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,720
you need to use when

327
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,279
so they built a map for you it's

328
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,480
literally a map of the software

329
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,920
development life cycle

330
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,540
and says all right if you're in the

331
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,920
requirements phase we got a tool for

332
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,980
that if you're in uh

333
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,660
culture

334
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,180
building and process maturing we got

335
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,380
stuff for that

336
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,000
and there's some overlap there and

337
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,620
they're all arranged around this idea of

338
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,800
cre that fairly recent

339
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,660
um only about a year and a half old I

340
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,160
think Sierra common requirement

341
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,360
enumeration

342
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,519
because there are so many standards out

343
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,560
there there are so many numbers to know

344
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,140
they said what if we just made a metal

345
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,140
layer that combined all the numbers and

346
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,180
linked everything together in a logical

347
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,440
way and that's what they did it's open

348
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,019
cre opencra.org you can jump there on

349
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,420
your computer right now

350
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,820
look up any security topic you want and

351
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,459
it's fully like linked this is what an

352
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,100
IST is these are cves for these are

353
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,540
everything you need to know about it

354
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,139
Community it is people

355
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,579
that's why we're here in the first place

356
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:46,500
if it was just us doing security out

357
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,540
there in the dark by ourselves

358
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,339
we wouldn't have awesome events like

359
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:51,959
this

360
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,339
that's why I love Drupal that's why I

361
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,500
love WordPress is the communities code

362
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,279
yeah it's PHP but people are amazing and

363
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,139
you have the best times chapters all

364
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:02,700
over the world I've been to 200 OAS

365
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,019
meetups in the last week because they're

366
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,700
online and they could do it that's how I

367
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,079
found out about the git vulnerability

368
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,480
there's two cves open for git right now

369
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,000
if you have not updated to the latest do

370
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,519
it immediately and you'll be safe but

371
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,839
that's literally news from last week

372
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,240
GitHub does a really good article on it

373
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,360
get has a poor boundary anyway Sidetrack

374
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,160
many events all over the world uh in

375
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,839
fact I mentioned it earlier get Guardian

376
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,839
actually hosts the in-person one in uh

377
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,540
Paris get Guardian is based to Paris

378
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,279
so that's what I mean Meetup looks like

379
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,779
we almost look like

380
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:34,860
but you can get together with your

381
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,440
friends talk shop you want to go to a

382
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,480
larger event something like secure WV

383
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,000
they have those too I'm really bummed I

384
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,820
can't go to the one in in November in uh

385
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,399
San Francisco the app SEC days because

386
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,279
of other prior engagements but uh they

387
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,200
have big events

388
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,760
you all know what events are so don't

389
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,620
harp on that educational training those

390
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,600
are my favorite things about OAS who

391
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,399
here oh none of you are all members if

392
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,980
you remember OAS you have complete

393
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,860
access to a secure flag

394
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,940
it's a training platform

395
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,660
that's always up to date with the latest

396
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,540
standards because it's written by the

397
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,519
teams at OAS who are responsible for

398
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,620
this stuff

399
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,660
in any area you want free unlimited

400
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,779
training you can go for search with it

401
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm not here to sell you on o wasp but

402
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,279
this blew my mind when I first started

403
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,760
digging through it uh you get a

404
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,040
freeos.org email account but uh that

405
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,079
gets you secure flag for as much

406
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,339
training as you want

407
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,079
truthfully I've not had enough time

408
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,760
since I started writing this talk to

409
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,800
start going through this stuff but

410
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,720
um there's a lot there there's also a

411
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,060
ton of trainings based on olasp I just

412
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,620
Googled literally Google to send the

413
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,019
speaker notes uh the Google search

414
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:49,620
um

415
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,980
uh OAS trainings or oauth Education and

416
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,500
Training and this is one of the articles

417
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,180
that came up there are hundreds of pages

418
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,279
of results

419
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,260
they also make a lot of Publications a

420
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,459
lot of white papers you'll read will

421
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:05,279
cite oasp or will come from OAS uh and

422
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,420
they have a book if you want to spend

423
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,519
the book money on a book

424
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,959
a lot of that crosses over the plot

425
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,779
projects so

426
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,360
okay I just told you a lot of

427
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,740
information about an organization that

428
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,779
no one's a member of and only a few

429
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,639
people have started touching the tools

430
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,779
of

431
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,720
how to use this stuff well

432
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,760
we'll break it down into these four

433
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,100
takeaways if you walk away with nothing

434
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,199
else from this talk these are the four

435
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,959
things you should remember about a wasp

436
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,579
top 10.

437
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,320
they make a top 10 list every single

438
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,760
year they're the top 10 type of tax

439
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,680
that's actually what it says it's

440
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,480
updated yearly

441
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,519
um

442
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,459
but it's kind of the 80 20 rule if you

443
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:50,279
are guarding against the most

444
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,199
active attacks out there that the script

445
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,060
kitties are throwing at anything they

446
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,138
can find an IP for

447
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,180
this is this year this is 21 21 they

448
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,740
haven't come out 2022 yet because well

449
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,600
we're still in 2022.

450
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,519
um but it's based on research and then

451
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,079
two of them are from Community surveys

452
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,279
like what do you think are the biggest

453
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,199
issues

454
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,660
so if you're gonna think hey is my app

455
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,820
secure as a developer this is your

456
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,380
starting point

457
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,180
hey have I actually fixed access control

458
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,560
the

459
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,380
do I guard it against injections

460
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,360
if you can go down this list because all

461
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,380
of these

462
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,720
it's not just a list

463
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,180
all of these have in-depth articles

464
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,579
about what they are

465
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,860
and very importantly how to prevent

466
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,740
so if you're starting your ciso says hey

467
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,079
now you Dev you are responsible for

468
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,360
security for your own apps you're not

469
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,380
alone

470
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,720
you have a whole world like telling you

471
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,940
how to prevent it

472
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,880
cheat sheets that cmciso comes in and

473
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,220
says what do you know about X

474
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,139
if you got time to Google

475
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,120
and read

476
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,680
then you got time to jump over the cheat

477
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,360
sheets and quickly find what you're

478
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,579
looking for the cheat sheets was an

479
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,740
awesome series that will go in depth

480
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,459
about any I think it's 100 some topics I

481
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:09,480
don't actually know the number off top

482
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,160
my head uh but there's a bunch of cheat

483
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,740
sheets into cheat sheets.oos.org

484
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,500
um that break down any general topic so

485
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,020
next time someone a director level or

486
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,459
somebody says hey what do you know about

487
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,380
kubernetes security

488
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,720
uh do two minutes of reading and you

489
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,699
will have a quick brain dump of what the

490
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,199
experts think about this including

491
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,960
architecture general terms definitions

492
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,340
and like how to prevent the worst

493
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,320
attacks based on the top 10 again

494
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,700
a wash goats not the greatest of all

495
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,100
time well maybe they are maybe they are

496
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,860
uh they are specifically designed

497
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,600
insecure applications

498
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,539
you want to see an example of how not to

499
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,160
write an app

500
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,000
there you go uh web code is the oldest

501
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,520
node.js codes pretty good wrong Secrets

502
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,620
is awesome you want to see how not to do

503
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,179
password management

504
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,919
they wrote a whole app for that you can

505
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,840
go and tear apart and see if this is how

506
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,160
not to do it

507
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,860
uh pie goat all the other incubator ones

508
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,260
are still need help if you want a web go

509
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,600
PHP they need help

510
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,820
but the greatest of all

511
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,220
isn't a goat the greatest of all

512
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,600
is Juice Shop

513
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,820
who's ever runs you shop

514
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,460
awesome well a few hands went up uh

515
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,640
Juice Shop is a awesome application with

516
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,919
a bunch of really fun cookies in it uh

517
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,480
Cookie's been the fact that you click on

518
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,039
it takes you to a YouTube video you

519
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,360
basically Rick rolls you without Rick

520
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,860
Rolling you

521
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,600
um without Rick

522
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,760
uh but it's very in depth uh you could

523
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,340
tactically run this in production you

524
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,740
shouldn't but you could it's that well

525
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,380
made and it's really well documented

526
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,360
there's tons of articles

527
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,280
that will go into details about how to

528
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,380
use it effectively and why you can use

529
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,780
it effectively and how to tear it apart

530
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,700
and tons of documentation on this thing

531
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,320
so maybe it is the greatest of all time

532
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,059
for insecure apps that you shouldn't run

533
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,160
in production

534
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,620
and zap

535
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,720
these are like the top four if you take

536
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,340
away if you take away nothing else

537
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,039
download zap and use this you will be

538
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,780
horrified and shocked

539
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,840
uh maybe not in that order

540
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,940
um so is that attacks proxy

541
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,440
uh they actually have a conference about

542
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,020
this these days uh stackhawk throws it

543
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,580
it's called zapcon

544
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,380
and there's a whole conference about zap

545
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,059
like it's a growing Community into

546
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,940
itself outside of you know outside of

547
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,179
the larger oops communities it's awesome

548
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,480
um so zap is an attack tool

549
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,780
and this is what it looks like

550
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,059
not not impressive but you throw the URL

551
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,559
you want to attack

552
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,059
make sure it's something you actually

553
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:49,679
have permission to attack and they're

554
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,559
expecting it so that we can be all um at

555
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,660
the whole good side of things

556
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,240
um a really good thing to test this with

557
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,200
is

558
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,580
you shop

559
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,520
uh and it will show you an extreme

560
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,320
example of what it can do

561
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,760
because you throw it and it takes a

562
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,640
while to run it's literally attacking

563
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,559
the app as hard as it can

564
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,220
and it throws up alerts so

565
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,080
I don't know the exact number on that if

566
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,340
you did the math

567
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,679
um but this is what it thinks is wrong

568
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,480
with Juice Shop

569
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,400
so if you're like well how do I even

570
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,980
start with making my app secure I read

571
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,660
all these things I got these checklists

572
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,039
I got these

573
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,100
spreadsheets I've got these white papers

574
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,799
oh wait a minute I can run zap actually

575
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,600
run down the list of alerts and start

576
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,220
tackling it from there

577
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,080
which ones that I should attack first oh

578
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,520
let's go cross-reference this with the

579
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,160
top ten which is the most likely

580
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,020
scenario for me

581
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,580
well they protect you in every situation

582
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,220
no that's a tool like any other tool

583
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,260
it's got limitations it's got uh

584
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,360
drawbacks one of the big problems with

585
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,400
it is false positives

586
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,200
they admit that they're working on that

587
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,580
again it's open source if you want to

588
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,160
help with that they'd love some help

589
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,039
um but it's a starting point

590
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,120
I actually don't know how long I've been

591
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,140
talking

592
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,640
22 minutes wow this faster than I

593
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,840
thought it was

594
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,480
um so in conclusion

595
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,220
you don't have to be alone out there

596
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,419
you don't have to

597
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,980
just wish that someone was helping you

598
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,360
because there's a whole Community people

599
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,400
to help you it's called OAS do you have

600
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,960
to join them to leverage them absolutely

601
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,179
not can you go use all of our tools

602
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:31,220
right now for free yes absolutely

603
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,299
because the other day security should

604
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:34,919
look like this not

605
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,559
panic and tickets and people yelling at

606
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,940
you and going looking for another job

607
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,419
because you got tired of it

608
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:44,580
start with top 10.

609
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,380
just reading that is super Illuminating

610
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,480
about Security in general

611
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,460
you got a specific question about a

612
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,860
specific area they made a cheat sheet

613
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,020
for you already guarantee it if they

614
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,580
didn't it's open source you could

615
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,720
probably contribute one it's something

616
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,580
you know about

617
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,320
play with the goats I'll show you what

618
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,460
not to do

619
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,400
and finally uh zap

620
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,400
download it you'll be horrified

621
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,260
I'm doing hello in Chicago

622
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,880
a little bit faster than I expected

623
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,440
because I had 70 slides but I got

624
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,580
through them somehow

625
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,740
so with that I'll open up for any

626
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,179
questions you all got

627
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:19,799
I was really hoping to have an OS member

628
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,299
in here that could tell me about hey

629
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,620
forgot to talk about that particular

630
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,020
part of it that I really like but uh but

631
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,460
since y'all are using tools if there's

632
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,020
uh well first if there's any questions

633
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,840
happy to try to answer those

634
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,659
then I got a question for you

635
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:36,659
foreign

636
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,880
fall okay

637
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:13,860
I'm in the same boat as you on that one

638
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,620
all I know is what in the in the on the

639
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,140
public conversation on it and it is that

640
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,880
exact sentiment that's what they said at

641
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,100
um zapcon uh this year

642
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,140
um zapcon is completely available online

643
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,120
so you can watch it all for free that's

644
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,039
what the lead dubs were saying is like

645
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,799
there's a cue we're working on itself as

646
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,419
fast as we can the false positive they

647
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:35,880
see is the bigger problem

648
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,280
um I forget that I could look it up but

649
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,539
I'm not going to

650
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:40,260
um

651
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,179
but that's the biggest issue people

652
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:45,299
because that kind of is intended to like

653
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,919
run locally

654
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,380
to test these things not

655
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,120
in production

656
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,860
though it is a flagship and you should

657
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,740
be able to do that that I think this is

658
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,740
me speculating is part of how they came

659
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,039
up with the production ready

660
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:05,220
category uh because zap will not qualify

661
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,960
for that because of that because you

662
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,000
can't run an Enterprise

663
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,780
um

664
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,340
I don't think that's like the motivator

665
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,799
is like that's make that fix this by not

666
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,840
letting them into a category but that

667
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,120
category should preclude them if it's

668
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,220
doing what they say it's going to just

669
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,559
let you run at a scale

670
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,399
optimism

671
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,640
well

672
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,640
um

673
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,120
but next question which is not a great

674
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,140
question is like do you know if there's

675
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,760
an open PR that someone's trying to fix

676
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,379
this yet that just needs upvotes

677
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:53,580
[Music]

678
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,500
help

679
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,380
I mean that's it's a I mean that PRS are

680
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,179
open is like the worst response in the

681
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,299
world

682
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:14,240
just make sure I'm on the right one

683
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,720
I mean 700 issues open so there's quite

684
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,280
the queue

685
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,480
uh let's see

686
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:30,980
as no PR is currently open

687
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,820
yeah yeah it's still open are the issues

688
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,559
still open so

689
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,820
it's been home for a while too 2018.

690
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,340
so everybody get online upvote this

691
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,799
immediately we'll get this fixed That's

692
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,140
The Power of uh Power that I'm serious

693
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,179
like I just had a ticket close

694
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,559
uh finally get fixed after like six

695
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,039
months for a uh extension on

696
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:04,440
a vs code extension

697
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,580
um

698
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,860
but it took six months during that time

699
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,539
they gained like six million users and

700
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,640
it's a UI problems like there's an extra

701
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,779
six million people that ran into

702
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,980
something that it could have fixed

703
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,600
earlier

704
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,220
um but what finally got is enough people

705
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,140
upvoted it they're like hey we'll fix it

706
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,700
yeah okay enough people have complained

707
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,000
now it's the loudest uh the um

708
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,100
squeakiest wheel gets the grease

709
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,419
unfortunately

710
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,419
but it's also just us so

711
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:34,020
that's the that's the plus and the minus

712
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,059
of any open source community

713
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:39,659
is it's us doing it like we're the ones

714
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:41,100
building there's no finger you can

715
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,299
really point that doesn't also

716
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,520
eventually point back to us as

717
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,799
individuals saying well why don't I fix

718
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,880
this

719
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,460
but at the same time

720
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,980
you got a family you got other

721
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,500
responsibilities like it's it's a

722
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,240
it's a balancing act but that's all open

723
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,120
source good and bad

724
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,799
and I'm just rambling any other thoughts

725
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,360

728
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,020
I know about stackhawk that I am very

729
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,940
comfortable saying is that they are the

main sponsor behind zapcon

731
