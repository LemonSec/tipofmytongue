1
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,440
cool

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,719
hi guys uh so my talk is gonna be about

3
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,300
drowning for dummies right uh I'm a big

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,699
old dummy it's kind of the point of this

5
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,500
um the intent of the talk right now is

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,939
to not go over something that's

7
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,000
incredibly technical or to explain to

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,060
you how to drive to tell you what it is

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,520
uh why you want to do it and then all

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,079
the mistakes that I've made in the

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,660
process of uh going through all of it

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,040
right

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,040
um so this is who I am uh so I'm lead

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,980
Hunter at Global Payments it is a

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,980
payments Processing Company that's part

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,180
of uh basically a big conglomerate of

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,039
payment companies uh I've got about

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,840
eight years of experience in security

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,640
analysis

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,300
um it ranges from Healthcare sector DOD

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,379
Finance hedge funds Payment Systems uh

22
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,860
all the above I'm a husband first a

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,780
hacker second and an internet introvert

24
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,280
this is probably the only time you're

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,659
ever going to see me in person

26
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,060
uh is when I do speaking engagements I

27
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,920
am not online I don't have a social

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,840
media presence

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,460
um and to kind of rip off of the prior

30
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,540
talk here

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,520
um missing this person's CTF judge and

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,799
contestant so the Australian cyber unit

33
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,340
puts on a yearly hackathon that a judge

34
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,659
if anyone is interested in that please

35
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,759
come find me afterwards I can help you

36
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,439
out with that

37
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,540
um

38
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,520
again agenda so what is threat hunting

39
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,259
uh why would you throw a hunt uh

40
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,880
pitfalls and mistakes and then we're

41
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,759
going to go over uh this question

42
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,040
uh you start with a quote uh it's from

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,140
one of my favorite books uh Cliff Stoll

44
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,659
a very very wonderful person probably

45
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,399
one of the first Hunters is what I would

46
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,320
say uh but it's really important here

47
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,479
and uh it's kind of a key point of the

48
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,159
talk here's is that

49
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,899
um it's not about being intelligent with

50
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,460
computers or being literate with

51
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,979
computers it's about just being literate

52
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,979
in general right the perspectives of

53
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,700
everyone in the space in security where

54
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,500
you come from the diverse backgrounds

55
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,680
and perspectives that you bring to uh

56
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,660
throughout hunting or analysis in

57
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,599
particular incredibly important in those

58
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,099
different perspectives can kind of play

59
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,080
into uh how you kind of approach things

60
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,500
right in particular in a couple examples

61
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,959
of that right I think a Communications

62
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,239
major would probably have a better idea

63
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,239
or uh route to detect social engineering

64
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,459
attacks right hey you communicate with

65
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,200
people all day every day probably

66
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,540
understand how to manipulate that

67
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,860
um another example of something like

68
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,080
that would be hey your DBA your database

69
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,180
administrator that person is probably

70
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,500
going to know where all your sensitive

71
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,900
sensitive data is stored

72
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,099
um it's going to know what type of

73
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,379
attack vectors or how those things would

74
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,239
be attacked

75
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:58,680
um I think this is incredibly important

76
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,379
again the name of the talk they're

77
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,060
having for dummies uh you could be you

78
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,680
could be dumb you still know how to do

79
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,480
security

80
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,940
um obligatory meme right uh what if I

81
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,280
told you drowning is just uh instant

82
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,480
response without the incident right

83
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,319
those skill sets right sock analyst a

84
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,560
throt hunter an IR analyst we are all

85
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,900
part of the the same team right we all

86
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,599
have a very similar skill set

87
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,760
um and it's incredibly important to not

88
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,440
uh pigeonhole yourself right just

89
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,239
because I'm a threat Hudson or a sock

90
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,180
analyst or a database administrator or

91
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,860
someone who's doing some sort of other

92
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,140
technical Pursuit it does not mean that

93
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,360
you cannot threat hunt or go look for

94
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,519
bad guys right it's incredibly important

95
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,920
to keep that in mind when you're

96
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,540
thinking about these things

97
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,459
uh so we'll start off what is dirt

98
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:48,659
hunting uh these are the three core

99
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,340
tenants right or at least this is an

100
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,620
opinion type thing right uh everyone's

101
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,760
kind of got a different definition of

102
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,500
what the right hunting is

103
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,640
um there's the book definition right

104
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,159
it's a proactive and iterative approach

105
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,920
to uh validating whether or not a host

106
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,080
is compromised right uh going out there

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,940
grabbing uh information coming from a

108
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,799
host uh checking whether or not bad

109
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,480
things have happened uh whether that's

110
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,760
indicators or compromise hashes domains

111
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,260
IP addresses whether or not the

112
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,299
president has a system or its behaviors

113
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,760
right so ttps

114
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,238
um again so that's that uh proactive

115
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:22,740
versus reactive uh the kind of

116
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,240
difference between that right there is

117
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,280
going to be uh incident response so

118
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,979
instead of responding to an alert or an

119
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,479
automated function of a security tool

120
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,979
that you've already deployed uh that you

121
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,380
may have been maintaining it's uh

122
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,880
proactive right you're going out and

123
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,340
actively searching out the bad guys and

124
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,600
the reason that's important in

125
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,400
particular uh versus the reactive

126
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,979
approach to security is that security

127
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:47,639
technology has not been updated or uh

128
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,160
has not Advanced as fast as the attacker

129
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,740
the signature signature Technologies in

130
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,199
particular have been uh almost identical

131
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,940
for years and years and years right

132
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,979
everyone knows what regex is you can

133
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,479
apply a pattern to something and match

134
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,340
something

135
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,720
but what happens if I added zero to the

136
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,699
end of my payload right a human is going

137
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,639
to be able to see those things

138
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,100
um before a tool would that kind of goes

139
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,660
to the next uh the next point there

140
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,060
human German and Tool oriented it's

141
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,620
really important to empower your people

142
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,840
to go look for bad things instead of

143
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,060
using your tools and using your people

144
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,400
to make your tools better the opposite

145
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,759
approach of taking your people and using

146
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,100
the tools to augment your people has

147
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,820
been in my opinion in my experience the

148
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,580
best route to actually finding that in

149
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,560
the network just because I have alerts

150
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,780
firing if anyone's ever done security

151
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,240
analysis you probably are well aware of

152
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,220
the alert fatigue that kind of occurs

153
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,680
right this process in particular you're

154
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,620
able to avoid that and then the third

155
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,539
tenant here right validation of

156
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,100
compromise that's kind of the end goal

157
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,740
this doesn't always occur right just

158
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,240
because I went and looked for bad does

159
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,060
not mean that I found bad and there are

160
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,639
a lot of other attributes and value that

161
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,199
kind of comes out of doing throughout

162
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,460
hunting other than this validation

163
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,320
compromise but if you were going to sell

164
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,620
this to someone right hey is my host pop

165
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,080
is my network owned that's kind of the

166
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,600
point

167
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,340
uh this is really dumbed down uh process

168
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,259
there's a lot more intricacies kind of

169
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,840
involved with the throat hunting process

170
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,180
um you start with hypothesis right uh

171
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,560
scientific method you don't always have

172
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,840
to start with the hypothesis uh but

173
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,759
still it's incredibly important to have

174
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,919
one right hey why am I going to look

175
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,259
right uh what am I going to go look for

176
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,360
are we looking for a behavior are we

177
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,460
looking for something that is occurring

178
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,500
and and why are we looking for right

179
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,440
having an informed approach in creating

180
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,960
your hypothesis and understanding okay

181
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,139
hey I have a gap in these detections in

182
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,720
this location these are the type of

183
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,240
actors that would be targeting me this

184
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,919
is how they would be targeting me and

185
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,660
creating a hypothesis surrounding that

186
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,000
is the first step the Second Step would

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,240
be data collection right uh so I'm going

188
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,220
to go look for this behavior let's say

189
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,780
it's uh we're gonna go to the first

190
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,819
equal injection on a database right now

191
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,440
one equals one attack just to make it

192
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,360
really basic and simple

193
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,060
um what logs do I need right we've got

194
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,979
to answer that question first and and

195
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,600
these Preparatory steps in the draw

196
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,340
hunting process are the bread and butter

197
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,240
right uh half of my job is research hey

198
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,099
this new attack occurred

199
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:29,280
um this new TTP to rip off on some of

200
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,780
the other talks that you guys may have

201
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,819
heard while you've been here uh Conti

202
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,620
right hey they're gonna they're gonna

203
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,660
delete backups maybe they're using VSS

204
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,240
admin to delete things okay well hey

205
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,800
that's a behavior of course that's

206
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,780
that's something that would occur um

207
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,580
taking that behavior and then extracting

208
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,039
uh or extrapolating the things that are

209
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,020
surrounding that right hey they're going

210
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,880
to delete backups why are they deleting

211
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,099
backups what would be the actions that

212
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,720
would be taken before so it would be

213
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,759
deleting backups taking all that stuff

214
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,160
collecting the logs understanding uh

215
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,340
where to go look is a big part of of the

216
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,020
game right

217
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,819
um the third step here investigation and

218
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,380
I'm going to kind of glare over this uh

219
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,419
the again the intent of the talk is not

220
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,520
to be incredibly technical here I'm not

221
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,139
going to teach you how to investigate

222
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,180
anything here but I will give you a

223
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,440
couple of methods

224
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,660
um a lot of what threat hunting is and

225
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,280
ends up being is you end up with a very

226
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,440
large data set at the start I have to

227
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,819
get after you've done your data

228
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,259
collection hey I need to go look at all

229
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,240
my database logs well how do I navigate

230
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,160
through said database logs to actually

231
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,319
identify something the vast majority of

232
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,458
the time it's going to be statistics

233
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,159
right it's basic math it's it's okay hey

234
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,140
what are my outliers what is the

235
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,140
standard deviation between uh how long

236
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,240
this session is connected okay what are

237
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,700
the outliers how can I group things

238
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,800
together in order to differentiate

239
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,420
between different groups of data to

240
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,720
determine okay hey this group of data

241
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,000
would be susceptible to to attacks

242
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
because has this selection of

243
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,899
vulnerabilities or XYZ

244
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,580
um and then the last piece here would be

245
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,560
outputs uh outputs are kind of

246
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,700
self-explanatory we're going to talk

247
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,680
about that a little bit of detail in the

248
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,540
subsequent slides

249
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,160
um and then the last thing to say about

250
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,320
this really simplified process here is

251
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,380
that every single point of this it's not

252
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,000
cyclical in the sense of like hey it's

253
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,800
going to go around a circle but each

254
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,660
point in the process can go back and

255
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,760
forth right you get your data collection

256
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,560
you realize hey I don't have these logs

257
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,880
and everyone's going to end up in that

258
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,300
scenario a lot of the time

259
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,260
especially if you're not aggregating all

260
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,240
your logs

261
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,760
what can I do with what I have I think

262
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,100
that's where we need to start what can I

263
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,860
do with what I have and then not only

264
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,600
what can I do with what I have but what

265
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,100
about the people that I have it doesn't

266
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,140
again it doesn't need to be a threat

267
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,339
Hunter it doesn't need to be a security

268
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:45,839
analyst it doesn't need to be an IR

269
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,940
responder in order to go look for these

270
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,100
things so again

271
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,620
on this line um what is important to

272
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,959
throwning these are five points uh they

273
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,399
are not related to each other but these

274
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,600
are what I think is important to draw

275
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,560
hunting

276
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,660
um an intelligence driven approach right

277
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,480
um if you are not informed about uh who

278
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,040
what where and when is going to be

279
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,019
targeting you uh how do I know what to

280
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,580
go look for right

281
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,860
um you don't it's kind of the simple

282
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,320
answer to that my Intel guy would be

283
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,459
really happy that I put this on the

284
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:17,040
slide he harps on me all the time I get

285
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,080
that everyone has a dedicated Intel

286
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,200
person but it's as basic as uh hey I had

287
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,240
these detections in place where are my

288
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,920
gaps

289
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,720
um and then targeting those gaps with

290
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,420
your huts based on the behaviors

291
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,339
adversarial mindset um I may be a blue

292
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,440
guy but I am also a hacker right I

293
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,260
believe red but having that mindset of

294
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,779
okay hey how would I do this how would I

295
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,880
break the thing and understanding how

296
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,440
you would break the thing can allow you

297
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,899
to kind of uh take that mentality okay

298
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,000
hey I'm gonna go use this whole this is

299
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,500
where I would Target so whatever I go

300
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,140
look for the bad thing there

301
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,779
um third thing here we're going to talk

302
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,880
about characteristics of an analyst this

303
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,760
is very very opinion based um called

304
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,040
these the four C's and the three F's

305
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,140
um the three F's being fail fast Fail

306
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,320
Hard fail often failure is incredibly

307
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,940
important when doing these things you're

308
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,320
going to fail you're going to make

309
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,300
mistakes and especially in throat

310
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,100
hunting it's a little bit different as

311
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,600
far as the criticality of your mistakes

312
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,339
right we're not talking about hey I need

313
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,279
to block this IP to sinkhole domain to

314
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,140
get rid of a malware infection it's not

315
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,180
that critical you're gonna fail you're

316
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,440
gonna go look for things and not

317
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,000
identify anything in the process of

318
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,860
going to look for those things that does

319
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,420
not mean that it doesn't have value not

320
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,300
only from the perspective of building

321
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,540
your own internal monologue and your own

322
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,760
experience but from the perspective of

323
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,860
you can identify things in a network

324
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,860
where hey I have a batch of 2012 R2

325
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,079
servers why are they there well I

326
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,160
wouldn't have known that if I wouldn't

327
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,040
have gone and looked right so that's

328
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,440
those are the three F's the four C's

329
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,660
here curiosity first and foremost and

330
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,760
curiosity is incredibly important being

331
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,320
able to communicate and being able to

332
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,019
communicate effectively to people who

333
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,100
don't understand what you're talking

334
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,200
about and then

335
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,640
um

336
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,200
actually forgot the other two I'm gonna

337
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,260
be honest a little bit nervous up here

338
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,560
um number four here uh ttps versus is

339
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,640
this is also another thing that I like

340
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,100
to harp on to my new guys is that uh

341
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,540
indicators are compromise and searching

342
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,920
for indicators compromise is not

343
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,720
throughout hunting just because you can

344
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,620
go Google or go check an IP in a seam

345
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,480
system and then get hits that does not

346
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,640
mean that you are hunting it's

347
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,260
incredibly important to Center your

348
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,940
hunts based off of behaviors and the

349
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,700
reason uh that's the case is iocs are

350
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,420
descriptive and or ttps are descriptive

351
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,519
versus iocs are more like a point in

352
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,380
time type of deal who's to say that

353
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,240
they're still valuable or whether or not

354
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,700
they're timely or anything of the above

355
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,160
and centering your hunts around ttps

356
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,459
allows someone to take those behaviors

357
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:57,300
and again a Singleton TTP is going to

358
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,399
allow you to kind of separate

359
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,899
um separate that out and then go search

360
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,120
for a broader range of things and then

361
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,040
again outputs uh instead we were going

362
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,060
to talk about this in a little bit more

363
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,040
detail the outputs of a threat hunt what

364
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,399
is that obviously reports right right

365
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,920
reports on a constant basis

366
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,600
um

367
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,040
compromise assessments there's going to

368
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,380
be mitigations patches detections

369
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,079
analytics you can kind of name it right

370
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,579
anything and everything that could kind

371
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,260
of come from understanding what your

372
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,360
data looks like and how someone would

373
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,120
attack it would be an output what I

374
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,700
would say there is that again kind of

375
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,700
harp on you don't find something

376
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,880
those mitigations and being able to

377
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,740
communicate those mitigations uh to

378
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,240
leadership in your organizations would

379
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,519
be the benefit even if you don't find

380
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,920
something

381
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,180
uh big old slide is from the Verizon

382
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,399
data breach um it kind of rips off into

383
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,500
a couple of other talks that have

384
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,180
happened as well

385
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,800
um 82 percent of organizations of the

386
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,959
breach involve the human element

387
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:58,620
um

388
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,779
I think someone said in another talk as

389
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:04,079
well is that humans while they may be

390
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,019
the biggest Vector they are not uh the

391
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,579
one to focus on I think that's what we

392
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,019
said

393
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,720
right but that that attack surface is

394
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,579
increasing right humans are always going

395
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:15,779
to be there that attack surface is

396
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,579
always going to grow as we have more

397
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:20,639
humans as we have uh more issues and uh

398
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,959
what what I think is important here on

399
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,579
this line in particular is that you

400
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:26,760
can't patch a human right uh and uh as

401
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,519
far as detections are concerned

402
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,639
um it's easier for a human to detect a

403
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,540
human than a computer can detect a human

404
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,639
and the reason being is again it goes

405
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,800
back to those detection patterns I've

406
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,660
got a pattern uh what happens if that

407
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,339
gets manipulated right what happens if I

408
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,920
encode it if I encrypt it if I add a

409
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,660
zero to the end uh human's going to be

410
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,760
able to uh with their eyes snap know

411
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,899
what that looks like because they've got

412
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,940
experience seeing before versus a

413
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,040
computer trying to match a pattern you

414
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,320
may miss

415
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,300
uh so why are we throw them so that's

416
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,860
what they're hunting is uh why should we

417
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,839
throw it fill the security control gaps

418
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:04,680
right

419
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,139
um so in the case of those uh security

420
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,660
technologies that you would deploy you

421
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,740
can kind of fill the security control

422
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,139
gaps uh and it's not it's not a full

423
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:16,920
fill right or a full fix it's very much

424
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,440
uh hey I can I can kind of supplement

425
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,680
and or uh Shore up a little bit of it by

426
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,420
going Google going to go look for those

427
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,100
things I think what's really important

428
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,740
there is not on an ad hoc basis if you

429
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,540
were going to go uh Hey I'm going to use

430
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,040
the hunting can fill a security control

431
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,940
Gap

432
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,459
um it's incredibly important to um

433
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,980
do that iteratively and repeat that

434
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,060
thing in order to pass the check uh

435
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,860
dwell time reduction I think this is

436
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,079
kind of self-explanatory dwell time is

437
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,639
going to be how long an actor is inside

438
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,320
of a network

439
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,300
um that being able to reduce the dwell

440
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,459
time by going into hunting

441
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,620
um yeah you should be able to find them

442
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,899
faster it's kind of quote there and the

443
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,639
last but not least never extreme unique

444
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,620
and change again about the deployment of

445
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,540
the security Technologies just because

446
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,399
you deploy security Technologies does

447
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,899
not mean that they are tuned they are

448
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,839
adequate to actually detect and create

449
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,459
the alerts that would be uh High

450
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:15,000
Fidelity kind of action in that changing

451
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,220
of the network allows those payloads and

452
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,260
the interest sees the sophistication of

453
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,060
what you're going to look at it's going

454
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,860
to be different

455
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,040
uh this is from sofos uh this is the

456
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,779
dwell time by company meat size the

457
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,060
point in this slide here is that as uh

458
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,000
employee account increases dwell time

459
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,800
decreases

460
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,360
um I don't think anyone believes that 19

461
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,800
days is going to be an acceptable amount

462
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,420
of time for an actor to be inside of a

463
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,620
network so I don't think it really

464
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,779
actually matters whether it's 19 or 52

465
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,259
but again just to kind of show you

466
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:47,420
especially in West Virginia

467
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,500
security organizations don't have a

468
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,600
bunch of security people right I think

469
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,980
it's important to kind of note that here

470
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,480
especially for this audience

471
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,100
all right uh last wide threat hunt slide

472
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,899
so it's people focused security solution

473
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:02,399
again about investing in your people

474
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,919
about it being a human solution versus a

475
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,040
technology solution I think again humans

476
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,299
brain is probably the best detection

477
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,699
engine that has ever been created all

478
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,099
those ideas kind of flow from us

479
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,299
um threats can look like legitimate

480
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:18,000
activity uh again to rip off some of the

481
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,299
talks that have been uh done here uh

482
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:22,740
live off the land attacks right hey

483
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,660
someone's going to use Powershell

484
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,520
um in a way that Powershell is used on a

485
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,980
normal basis uh maybe your uh CIS admins

486
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,320
are using Powershell to

487
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,540
um automate something or access

488
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,760
something it's going to look like

489
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,919
malicious behavior so again that that

490
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,620
Fidelity of your alerts and avoiding

491
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,140
avoiding that in its entirety

492
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,760
um and looking for things in that in

493
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,919
that way increase in their tax

494
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:49,380
sophistication again to kind of uh go

495
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,360
back to conti and and some of the other

496
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,520
talks is that increase in attack

497
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,799
sophistication and Conti you can see

498
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:58,020
that these businesses or these groups

499
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,179
are being run like businesses they've

500
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,520
got Dev teams they've got everything

501
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,799
everything that a regular business would

502
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,980
have that's going to continue to happen

503
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,419
and the last thing here and I think I've

504
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,039
said this a couple of times things are

505
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,860
better at catching humans and computers

506
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,480
uh pitbulls and mistakes this is the

507
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,919
good type yeah this is the good stuff

508
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,580
right uh I've messed up so many times in

509
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,559
doing this I'm going to continue to mess

510
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,299
up I'm going to continue to make

511
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,700
mistakes but where do you start right um

512
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,260
this is a lot of a lot of time when I

513
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,520
get new people in

514
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,160
um it's what what do what I go what do I

515
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,440
go look for right uh how do I go look

516
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,400
for it

517
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,840
um where do I start

518
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,860
um there are a million different

519
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,780
resources out there I really wanted to

520
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,940
avoid talking about miter in my talk uh

521
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,980
but we're gonna bring it up here

522
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,500
um the the miter framework don't use it

523
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,419
as checklist is what I would say but it

524
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,940
definitely can give you the ability to

525
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,000
um go out there and identify ttps that

526
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,020
would be applicable to your network

527
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,840
right or if you've identified a threat

528
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,280
actor or a group that would be targeting

529
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,140
your sector it will give you the

530
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,120
breakout of TTP

531
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,720
um

532
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,900
so yeah get a miter Google any of you

533
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,179
any and all the above um just start is

534
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:12,179
what I would say if you get started

535
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,520
we've got a good route to continue uh

536
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,260
the second bullet here in this kind of a

537
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,500
opinion Ai and ml is not a silver bullet

538
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,960
you can't deploy AI or ml in a network

539
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,419
without a large or specific data set and

540
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:25,740
actually expect it to do what you want

541
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,179
it to do

542
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,340
um it does have a use and it does have a

543
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,960
use in a lot of places but I think it's

544
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,280
incredibly important that if you are

545
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,200
going to use artificial intelligence or

546
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,240
machine learning they use in a proper

547
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,100
way and you actually use it on a data

548
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,020
set that's actually applicable a lot of

549
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,419
people are not going to have that amount

550
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,100
of data to where it actually is useful

551
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,460
in the last last one here at hot hunting

552
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,340
and I talked about this already is that

553
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,620
just because you ran a hunt once does

554
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,940
not mean that it's not going to happen

555
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,980
tomorrow

556
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,299
so revisiting the things that you've

557
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,280
done in the past just because it's

558
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,240
something that you've done in the past

559
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,919
doesn't make it not interesting doesn't

560
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,880
mean that you're not going to find

561
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,080
something different the next time you

562
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,360
look and again about it being a human

563
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,700
process that's uh it's going to be

564
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,980
something that you need to do

565
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,299
um I think this is the last slide here

566
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:13,799
uh and these are the last pitfalls and

567
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,120
mistakes rabbit hole is a waste of time

568
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,340
uh we've got your hypothesis you go and

569
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,240
look for something and you're looking

570
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,980
through your data a lot of time you're

571
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,720
going to find something else you're

572
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,340
going to see a user agent that sticks

573
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,220
out where you can see an HTTP header

574
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,460
that looks abnormal and it may not be uh

575
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,280
part of your um

576
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,320
hunt but what's important here is that

577
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,440
you separate uh your hunts that way log

578
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,720
that in your report go back and revisit

579
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,299
it I've spent countless countless

580
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,760
countless hours just tracking one little

581
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,220
piece of information

582
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,919
please avoid that if you can bias of all

583
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,760
kinds especially when you're hunting

584
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,620
confirmation bias right only looking for

585
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,539
information that is related to your

586
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,900
hypothesis so you can confirm it

587
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,419
I would avoid that there are many other

588
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,039
types of bias where I can get into that

589
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,260
here context being intelligence I think

590
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,240
is really important is your intelligence

591
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,580
timely is it related to what you're

592
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,100
doing is it related to the news cycle is

593
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,020
an executive telling you hey I saw a

594
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,299
news article go look at this thing again

595
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:21,960
context is King and if context isn't

596
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,419
present it's not worthwhile

597
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,160
um and then Baseline fallacy this is the

598
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,539
last but not least a lot of people like

599
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:29,700
to use these tools to go okay hey this

600
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,980
is known good in my network right this

601
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,659
is the status of my network this is what

602
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,700
it's supposed to look like

603
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,299
um

604
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,159
what I think is important there is how

605
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,600
do you know that you weren't compromised

606
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,700
when you took your Baseline

607
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,620
um and then not only that but how do you

608
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,780
know what no good is um having having

609
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,880
procedures and making sure that your

610
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,220
gold images are actually gold

611
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,299
um is incredibly important

612
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,980
and this last slide here um and it's

613
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,299
kind of the end this is really the point

614
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,159
of what I'm trying to say here is a

615
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,659
proactive approach to security analysis

616
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:02,820
required to accurately detect and get

617
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,919
ahead of attacks the point here is to

618
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,960
get ahead of it right to not respond to

619
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,280
things we want to actually fix the

620
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,980
problem before it actually happens and

621
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,559
or catch it while it is happening and

622
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,299
then last but not least different

623
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:16,799
perspectives and backgrounds are more

624
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,240
likely to better than an organization

625
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,100
just because someone doesn't have a not

626
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,539
uh doesn't have a traditional security

627
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,039
background or doesn't come from a

628
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,140
traditional security space does not mean

629
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,520
that they don't have a value or a

630
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,080
benefit especially when it comes to

631
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,659
proactive security again the different

632
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,100
facets of humans and the different

633
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,080
perspectives that people bring to the

634
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,780
table especially in this space are

635
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,940
incredibly important

636
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,860
I think that's it

637
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,140
questions

638
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,240
go for it

639
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,240
sometimes

640
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:00,299
outside

641
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,679
yeah um and I think it I think the only

642
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,720
caveat there is be cognizant of time

643
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,520
right not everyone can do it all the

644
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,320
time uh no one can not everyone can

645
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,580
dedicate eight hours a day to going

646
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,740
looking for bad we've got regular job

647
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,940
duties

648
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,919
um what I found success in is not only

649
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:25,140
getting all the stakeholders involved

650
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,059
whether it is a assist admin or a

651
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,340
database admin or your devs or whatever

652
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,200
whoever it may be but asking the

653
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,580
question is uh what are you worried

654
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,919
about where are your crown jewels uh

655
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,799
what is important to you if if something

656
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,539
were to go down

657
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:40,080
um

658
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,000
which one which piece of that is most

659
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,500
important and then have them focus on

660
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,140
that in particular and then that out

661
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,460
attacks that would be surrounding those

662
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,700
things

663
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,000
