54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,900
like nexcloud proxmox for VMS

55
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,300
and I don't have any certifications or

56
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,140
degrees in cyber security I do it just

57
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,480
for fun I do like to call that security

58
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,140
as a hobby

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,319
so about Cardinal Technology Solutions

60
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,340
Cardinal Technology Solutions was

61
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,140
founded in 2014 as an I.T MSP company

62
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,580
um that is

63
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,800
started local to Frederick County and

64
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,900
Winchester Virginia a lot of businesses

65
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,200
in the area needed that type of service

66
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,580
they needed someone to handle their I.T

67
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,800
but they couldn't justify the cost of

68
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,019
hiring a full-time employee or part-time

69
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,300
employee to manage their Network

70
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,739
[Music]

71
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,660
so our managed service provider we're

72
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,160
the I.T department for small medium

73
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,860
businesses just some of the businesses

74
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,159
that we help public sector entities

75
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,159
things like water plants Sheriff's

76
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,420
departments police departments

77
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,360

79
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,620

80
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,120
[Music]

81
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,400

82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,560

83
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,620

workstations uh now for small medium

86
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:40,860
businesses this will be a majority of

87
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,540
Windows I'd say 760 out of 80 are

88
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,379
windows workstations and servers another

89
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:50,000

91
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,140
ends of Linux workstations here and

92
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,120
there

93
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,580
and as I mentioned before we did sponsor

94
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,840
the event this year I have a table

95
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,480
outside if you'd like to see me after

96
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,940
the presentation have any questions feel

97
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,200
free to come on up

98
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,420
um so I've mentioned that I'm a computer

99
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,099
hobbyist I like to do self-hosted

100
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,480
Services

101
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,160
um so I listed a few of my recent

102
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,918
projects uh that I have going on or have

103
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,560
completed in the past uh I do use

104
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,620
proxbox I tried that in a personal

105
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,620
setting and then uh started doing it in

106
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,199
a professional setting as well made a

107
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,900
virtual gaming computer where you take a

108
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,139
GPU and you pass it through to the VM

109
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,440
and use it just like you would any other

110
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,120
gaming computer when you plug a monitor

111
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,600
in it is actually attached to the VM

112
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,580
running on the desktop instead of the

113
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,240
actual bare metal

114
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,639
created a virtual arcade machine with

115
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,699
retropie there are many different uh

116
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,120
instructional articles videos on how to

117
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,199
do that

118
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,780
um I have probably five Raspberry Pi's

119
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,699
at this point all doing different

120
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,820
projects I did eventually upscale that

121
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,240
and uh kind of retrofit it into an

122
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,540
actual old arcade multi-cade from the

123
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,180
1980s the guts no longer worked in that

124
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,900
so I fit it in there works great

125
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,680
thank you

126
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,180
I uh

127
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,160
figure managed currently use different

128
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,820
self-hosting stuff proxbox next Cloud

129
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,500
Tactical rmm for my personal equipment

130
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,199
it helps me manage all the windows and

131
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,340
Linux and Mac updates and

132
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,139
remote into anything that I need to

133
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,460
wherever I am

134
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,759
also found a secure way to host your own

135
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,979
Services web pages

136
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,080
from basically any internet connected

137
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,060
computer

138
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,180
this uses a linode or any other VPS with

139
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,660
a public IP and you use wireguard to

140
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,620
Tunnel it and pass through using nginx

141
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,100
reverse proxy so you can have a computer

142
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,199
at your house with a resident internet

143
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,180
connection you don't have to pay extra

144
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,220
for a static IP you don't have to mess

145
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,160
with port forwarding you just

146
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,800
set up wire guard connect the two and

147
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,539
then put some firewall rules on the VPS

148
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:22,919
and

149
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,740
you're up and running

150
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,520
[Music]

151
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,680
and configuring and manage greenbones

152
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,940
security assistant

153
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,560
that's obviously why we're here we'll

154
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,199
talk about that in a bit if you have any

155
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,639
questions on this

156
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,259
um you can see me after the presentation

157
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,720
see me out at the table I love sharing

158
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,100
knowledge and getting knowledge in

159
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,280
return

160
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,020
so what is green bone what do all these

161
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,340
letters mean

162
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,280
green bone as we'll find out shortly

163
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,680
loves their acronyms

164
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,460
um

165
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,680
their their services almost all of them

166
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,620
have some sort of acronym tied to them

167
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,080
so we'll go through briefly and explain

168
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,060
what they mean

169
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,280
uh so green bone is the world's most

170
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,259
widely used open source vulnerability

171
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,160
management provider

172
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,419
and you may be more familiar with

173
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:13,979
openvas

174
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,600
um openvas is maintained by the same

175
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,560
company

176
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,840
greenbone is the interface on top of it

177
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,940
so openvas is the actual thing that is

178
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,160
like the engine in the car it does the

179
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,199
vulnerability management and scanning

180
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,380
and greenbone is the interface that you

181
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,560
can use to tell open fast what to do it

182
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
also gives you

183
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,960
reports it monitors Trends and you can

184
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,940
generate different actions based on

185
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,330
those scans

186
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,360
[Music]

187
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,180
we mentioned their GSA or greenbone

188
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,099
security assistant is the GUI to open

189
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,100
this

190
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,220
[Music]

191
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,819
GCE greenbone Community Edition uh used

192
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,740
to be called greenbone Source Edition is

193
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,479
what we'll be covering today in Greater

194
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,020
detail this is uh the one that you built

195
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,000
from source for free

196
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,699
there is no support for it other than

197
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,560
some Community forms that you can reach

198
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,139
out to if you have issues the community

199
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,180
is great I've contributed as well to

200
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,759
their documentation to make sure when

201
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,240
they release new green bone

202
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,979
releases that they're documentation on

203
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:26,479
compiling it is correct

204
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,539
greenbone cloud service this is a paid

205
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,580
service where they they essentially spin

206
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,779
up an instance of green bone for you the

207
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,360
benefit to that is it's managed by them

208
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,360
it's constantly updated by them and it

209
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,700
also comes with their paid support so if

210
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,500
you have issue you open to take it and

211
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,140
they take care of it

212
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,720
and on a similar note greenbone

213
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,540
Enterprise Appliance these are physical

214
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,779
green bone boxes that you put in a

215
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,820
server rack plug into your network and

216
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,580
it does basically all of the same things

217
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,620
but it is on premises

218
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,420
you also get the benefit of that paid

219
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,719
support

220
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,459
the next two greenbone Community Feed

221
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,640
and greenbones security feed

222
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,580
so many vulnerability scanners use a

223
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,920
database of vulnerabilities things like

224
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,779
nvt cves

225
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,240
to

226
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,640
compare their scans to to see if a

227
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,160
machine is vulnerable so this is what

228
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,260
they call their feeds Community Feed is

229
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,820
released semi-frequently

230
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,640
and it contains a lot of the more

231
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,080
important ones that you should check for

232
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,899
the ones that make news headlines the

233
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,959
ones that um you know go

234
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:50,160
basically noticed or actively exploited

235
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,680
that comes with the greenbone Community

236
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,880
Edition

237
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,980
and the greenbone security feed is their

238
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,860
paid for one so when you get a cloud

239
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,120
service license or an Enterprise

240
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,640
appliance that uses a security feed

241
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,640
that's actively managed monitor pushed

242
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,760
out by the greenbone team it has all the

243
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,600
latest

244
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,080
uh nves within just a couple hours they

245
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,720
have that nve in their software ready to

246
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,200
push

247
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,760
so that's all great where do we get

248
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,380
started uh there are a few different

249
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,000
routes that you can use to check out

250
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,460
greenbone for yourself

251
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,180
[Music]

252
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,279
we'll be looking at greenbone Community

253
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,860
Edition so it's compiled from source

254
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,580
code

255
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,380
self-maintained and updated and then

256
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,480
uses the greenbone Community Feed

257
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,459
no dedicated support but you do have the

258
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,620
community forums to reach out to and a

259
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,440
great community that can offer help and

260
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,200
if you're competent in it you can offer

261
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,680
help in return

262
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,500
there is a greenbone Enterprise trial so

263
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,240
you can go on their website and sign up

264
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,820
for a test key this gives you access to

265
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,279
their Enterprise version of greenbone

266
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,180
for uh 14 days for free it uses their

267
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,579
green bone security feed their premium

268
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,500
most up-to-date feed

269
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,440
and it's super easy to use the trial you

270
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,540
download the appliance for virtualbox or

271
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,360
VMware you pop it in there you fire it

272
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,820
up you put your test key in and it's up

273
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,640
and running super easy

274
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,200
and they also have the greenbone cloud

275
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,079
service trial just as we mentioned they

276
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,640
spin up an instance for you in the cloud

277
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,500
it's automatically maintained and

278
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,760
updated because it's on their

279
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,279
infrastructure same thing you register

280
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,140
for an account you try it for free for

281
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,360
14 days and you never have to worry

282
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,959
about any maintenance about that

283
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,700
so when compiling from source with this

284
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,220
greenbone security Edition

285
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,140
you'll be using your own Hardware or a

286
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,440
VPS so we'll look at the

287
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,680
Tech requirements for the software

288
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,600
I put a link up here to view the

289
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,279
official Guide tips and tricks on using

290
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,339
it and compiling it

291
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:02,220
we have supported operating systems uh

292
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,040
these use Debian stable which is

293
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,220
Bullseye for their code name Ubuntu 2204

294
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:14,040
LTS Fedora 3536 sent OS 9 stream

295
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,959
that doesn't mean that you can't use it

296
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,660
on anything else not listed but they

297
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,640
officially

298
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,260
recommend those operating systems to run

299
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,579
on

300
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,440
looking at minimum system requirements

301
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,079
doesn't take too much you just need a

302
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,959
two cores out of a processor four gigs

303
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,380
of RAM and they say 20 Gigabytes of disk

304
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,140
space available to store the databases

305
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,320
and any reports that you create

306
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,600
recommended system requirements you'll

307
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,420
need a quad core or greater processor

308
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,240
eight gigs of RAM or greater

309
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,940
and 60 gigabytes of disk space or

310
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,019
greater the benefit to their

311
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,779
entire software suite is it scales up

312
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:00,000
depending on what resources you give it

313
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,079
so you can give it 32 cores and 32

314
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,240
gigabytes of RAM it's going to use it

315
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,940
and it's going to perform a lot better

316
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,740
this space and won't use any more than

317
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,399
it really needs to so adding on disk

318
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,920
space allows for more reporting more

319
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,860
scanning it tracks more historical

320
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,820
information for you

321
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,079
the next process is how to install it

322
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,480
so you'll spin up your favorite

323
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,420
supported distro of Linux whether that's

324
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,660
Debian Ubuntu Fedora cine OS uh it'll be

325
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,000
your choice of platform so you'll do it

326
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,980
on the Node you can do it on your choice

327
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,040
of VPS you could do it on bare metal you

328
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,320
could do it on any hypervisor you have

329
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,180
access to

330
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,899
um anything that has a

331
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:53,940
x8664 processor it doesn't quite work on

332
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,390
arm but they are developing that part

333
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,019
[Music]

334
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:01,019
and I put the commands listed here in

335
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:04,680
there documentation

336
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,720
and their documentation we'll take a

337
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,820
look at it in a second it lays it out

338
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,700
command by command so each one it'll

339
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,380
tell you the command it'll tell you

340
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,660
exactly what it does and why they're

341
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,720
doing it and they keep it fairly

342
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,459
regularly updated

343
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,260
so by the time the new release comes out

344
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,360
for the Community Edition the document

345
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,000
documentation has already been corrected

346
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,060
for that new version so they have the

347
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,060
newest stable version and then they have

348
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,000
the old stable version documentation for

349
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,440
compiling each is in that page

350
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,720
once you compile it you can get on the

351
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,459
web page that it spins up on the web

352
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:48,300
server using the admin user and it does

353
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,980
assign you a randomly generated password

354
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,079
and it tells you that as you're running

355
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,420
the commands you can just copy that put

356
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,920
it in a safe place

357
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,420

personal user on the system with your

360
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,220
own password and it'll take a minute for

361
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,220
the vulnerability feeds to populate into

362
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,139
the database

363
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,420
um during the install one of the last

364
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,180
pieces it pulls down all of the recent

365
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,079
greenbone Community feeds and starts

366
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,180
putting them into the database this

367
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,680
could take anywhere from about 15

368
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,300
minutes to an hour depending on what

369
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,820
specs that you gave it and we'll take a

370
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,740
look at that section in a minute to see

371
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,839
is the database done can I start working

372
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,920
and once it's done you start creating

373
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,980
tasks and start scans

374
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,019
once it's finished we can take a look at

375
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,120
the results from the scans right in the

376
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,399
interface and we can tell it to generate

377
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,519
PDF reports you can pop them open and

378
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,899
see the info in there we'll take a look

379
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,500
at this as well

380
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:55,680
so let's hop over to a live instance I

381
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,079
just spun up today

382
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,519
so this will be the first thing you see

383
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,880
once you get onto the greenbone system

384
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,800
it'll just come up with a username

385
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,000
password field

386
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,980
your username will be admin and there

387
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,139
will be a randomly generated string of

388
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,899
text for the password when you're

389
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,860
logging in for the first time

390
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,019
the first screen you're brought to is

391
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,339
the

392
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,320
dashboards page

393
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,339
that will be for

394
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:27,839
monitoring and managing what exactly

395
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,920
that instance is doing

396
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:37,800
so we'll go along the top bar to each

397
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,160
page and take a look at what each one

398
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,550
has to offer

399
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,640
[Music]

400
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,880
does not thank you

401
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,820
okay

402
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,480
there we go how's that looks better

403
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,860
so go back to dashboards

404
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,559
you'll notice in this interface they

405
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,079
love pie charts some things may not be

406
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,400
appropriate for a pie chart in this

407
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,699
interface But be sure to use them

408
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:23,760
so it shows any scans currently going on

409
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,040
by tasks by status

410
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,260
so we see we have two tasks that are

411
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,320
completed one that is currently running

412
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,140
we have severity class so it shows the

413
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,919
category of each one after it's

414
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,660
completed its scan

415
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,539
and this massive pie chart with big

416
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:45,179
numbers down here that just lists the

417
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:48,059
nvts currently in the database this

418
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,100
doesn't mean that your network has 61

419
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,480
000 High vulnerabilities that you need

420
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,059
to address so now don't be too concerned

421
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:56,600
about that number

422
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,980
we'll take a look at tasks under the

423
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,640
scans tab this is the main tab that

424
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,460
you'll look at for seeing how it's doing

425
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,059
uh so looking at the

426
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:10,740
pie charts kind of gives you the same

427
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,960
information that we saw on the dashboard

428
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,080
and these are your scans and tasks that

429
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,840
you have listed uh so for the first one

430
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,299
here we see we told it to scan a single

431
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:22,679
public IP

432
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,320
it says it's done there's one report it

433
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,620
tells you what day like a time stamp of

434
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,660
that last report generation time

435
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,240
and then it tells you at a glance the

436
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,840
highest severity of that scan

437
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,419
you could also tell it to do ranges of

438
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,820
ips so if you spin this up on your local

439
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,160
network you can tell it to scan the

440
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,760
entire Lan range I believe on the the

441
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,820
built-in limit on greenbone here you

442
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,120
could scan 8192 hosts and then you can

443
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,039
just break it up into multiple tasks if

444
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,660
you have more hosts

445
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,200
so we see here I scan a range of public

446
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,820
IPS

447
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,919
and a single IP public pacing that has a

448
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,900
10.0 vulnerability so we'll take a look

449
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,220
at that in a second

450
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,260
and we see this one down here is a range

451
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,280
of public IPS it is part way done and

452
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,600
you can see because it hasn't finished

453
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,419
it hasn't generated a report but we can

454
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,460
see in a different tab the severity

455
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,419
listed on that

456
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,320
under reports shows us exactly what it

457
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,620
says reports so it'll show us our

458
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,400
currently running one at the top here

459
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,799
and it shows us what it's currently

460
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,799
seeing how many numbers bad things

461
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,059
are

462
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,980
current and it's kind of fun to sit on

463
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,720
this tab and watch the numbers tick up

464
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,860
because it does it live

465
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,480
we can see this one the single public IP

466
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,080
that has a 10.0 uh it's already done and

467
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,280
it has

468
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,260
that it has nine High vulnerabilities

469
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,780
and eight medium

470
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,480
and this single public IP down here has

471
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,200
only one low

472
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:16,080
results shows a

473
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,799
total list of the vulnerabilities

474
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,919
between all of your scans so between all

475
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,419
three here's what it's seeing so we have

476
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,700
operating system end of life

477
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,440
so we can click on that and it tells us

478
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,860
exactly what it found and the impact and

479
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,500
the solution so this is kind of similar

480
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,360
to openvas if you take a look at the

481
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,160
nves that and the vulnerabilities that

482
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,960
it pulls up after that

483
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,940
so it says the operating system at

484
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,080
scanned is Debian Linux 9. uh W9 is no

485
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,340
longer supported

486
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,919
and it Flags it as a 10.0

487
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,260
now you can say well I don't think

488
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,299
that's a 10.0 I'd like to put in an

489
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,760
override for that and you can we'll show

490
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,360
that in a second

491
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,220
it explains the impact that hey the

492
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,140
operating system isn't receiving any

493
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,140
further updates and it could be targeted

494
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,660
by an attacker with a zero day or a

495
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,220
vulnerability that the vendor is no

496
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,720
longer patching against

497
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,500
and it tells you yeah you need to update

498
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,700
your your install

499
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,539
and it'll show you very application

500
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:30,419
specific things as well so this is an

501
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,520
outdated version of webmin that is

502
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,980
running and it tells you exactly what

503
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,620
version of weapon and why it doesn't

504
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,240
like it

505
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,760
and it'll tell you the solution type the

506
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,620
vendor has already said that they're not

507
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,020
putting a fix out for this

508
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,200
um most likely that you'll need to

509
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,840
update the version number of women but

510
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,340
this current version the vendor has said

511
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,559
we're not uh patching against this

512
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,918
vulnerability

513
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,780
so you have notes and overrides notes is

514
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,299
basically what it sounds like it's just

515
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:10,760
an open field for you to jot notes down

516
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,960
and overrides is what you put in when

517
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,659
you basically want to acknowledge a

518
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:19,880
vulnerability

519
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,860
or reduce its score or change its score

520
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,200
so if you're adding a new override you

521
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,840
could put the nvt ID of that

522
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,580
vulnerability in here

523
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,679
you can say yes active you can select

524
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:37,620
specific locations or hosts

525
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,940
you can change the vulnerability score

526
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,880
to something else or change its severity

527
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,440
and then it gives you a little text box

528
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,080
to say why you're doing it

529
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,320
so I could say I'm acknowledging this

530
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,020
alert I'm reducing it to a 0.0 and the

531
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,840
reason is the vendor has said that they

532
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,000
will not fix this issue so that way

533
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,280
every time I do a further scan it's not

534
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,260
coming up with this 10.0 that gets

535
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,760
really distracting when you look at it

536
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,419
on reports

537
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,880
so assets that shows you exactly what

538
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,580
you're scanning always a reminder or

539
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,020
disclosure when you're scanning public

540
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,940
IPS please make sure you get permission

541
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,460
from the owner operator of that

542
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,780
it shows you any operating systems that

543
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,760
it's encountered so it showed that

544
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,860
Debian Linux 9 the one that it flagged

545
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,840
as a 10.0 outdated

546
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,559
shows that here and it also shows the

547
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,120
current version Debbie and Linux was

548
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,620
another host that it identified

549
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,940
this is where it shows any TLS

550
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,980
certificates of any web servers that it

551
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,620
encounters it'll log the serial numbers

552
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,860
the expiration dates the host names and

553
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,720
the issuers and you can review them here

554
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,020
as well

555
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,960
resilience is uh interesting I haven't

556
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,659
taken a look at it myself I always

557
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:12,419
you're welcome to but here you can put

558
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:15,659
compliance policies and Audits and they

559
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:17,700
also have a spot to put a business

560
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,480
process map this allows you to kind of

561
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,820
identify the impact of a vulnerability

562
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,620
to a business or a specific Department

563
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,340
in the business

564
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,000
under this tab it shows the entire

565
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,679
database of everything that is possibly

566
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,500
pulled in from the greenbone community

567
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,360
feed

568
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,820
so we can see it's pulled in a bunch of

569
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,340
different things uh it's showing all

570
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,720
Souza stuff here

571
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,820
and they have many different databases

572
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,679
to pull in those vulnerabilities so they

573
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,380
have nvt cve CPE

574
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,460
oval and then they have cert

575
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,039
vulnerabilities and advisements

576
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,820
they have specifically German uh

577
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,460
database as well because greenbone is a

578
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,600
German company

579
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,059
so they pull in their own National cert

580
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:15,960
database into their as well

581
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,720
targets shows exactly that when you set

582
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,900
up a new task it adds a Target in

583
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,419
and it shows you what IPS you're

584
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:26,279
scanning and exactly what you're

585
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,120
scanning for

586
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,580
and if we edit one of these it'll show

587
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,880
what ports it's scanning and what tests

588
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,700
it'll do to consider it as a Live host

589
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,559
or not

590
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:46,260
um so by default it'll try to Ping it

591
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,240
and if it doesn't ping it assumes it's

592
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,400
dead and it won't scan it but if I know

593
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,279
hey this server or workstation or

594
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,480
whatever it is that you're scanning

595
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,179
doesn't respond to pinks but I know it's

596
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,520
on the network it's active and it should

597
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,600
be scanned

598
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,120
I can drop this drop this a live test

599
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,299
down and just Mark consider alive and

600
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:07,860
it'll go ahead and try to do the scans

601
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,779
even though that it wasn't getting a

602
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:12,440
ping earlier

603
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,900
Port lists will show the predefined uh

604
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,480
range of ports that it'll scan you can

605
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,020
add your own custom ones but the default

606
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:32,100
Ayana TCP UDP ports covers basically

607
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,960
anything that you want but if you're

608
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,299
looking for targeted ports or Services

609
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,760
you can add in your own custom ports to

610
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,140
scan exactly what you want to see

611
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,400
credentials it does offer credentialed

612
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,480
scanning

613
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,039
so you can add things like SSH

614
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,779
credentials you can add in Windows

615
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,880
domain credentials file server

616
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,460
credentials and it will log into the

617
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,500
server and run vulnerability scans that

618
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,179
way it'll show you some additional

619
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,520
details that just that external outside

620
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,658
scan can't see

621
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,520
scan configs lists the categories of

622
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,080
vulnerabilities that it will check for

623
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,580
during the scan

624
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,799
there were many different ones but it

625
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,900
defaults to the full and fast category

626
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,900
that seems to be the most used and most

627
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,600
effective it does a combination of scan

628
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,179
for most of everything except for

629
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:33,240
printers and it does it in a timely

630
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,640
manner but you can make custom scans to

631
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,980
check for certain things or add certain

632
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,600
things in that this category doesn't

633
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,899
have

634
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,720
you have alerts and schedules I haven't

635
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,520
used Too Much on alerts but if you look

636
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,100
at schedules you can have your scans run

637
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,460
on a schedule so I can go back to any of

638
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,779
these tasks

639
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,720
and tell it to run weekly monthly daily

640
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,320
whatever you want at a specific time and

641
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,740
it'll log it under schedules

642
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,960
report formats you'll never really need

643
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,360
to touch all the defaults are fine but

644
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,419
you can see what it can export to it can

645
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:15,539
give you an XML CSV PDF or just a text

646
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,960
file

647
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,580
scanners by default it will use openbass

648
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,159
as its engine in the hood

649
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,659
and

650
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:29,820
scan with that but you can also switch

651
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,640
to specifically the cve scanner if

652
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,020
that's what you're looking for or you

653
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,360
want a different set of results by that

654
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,840
scanner

655
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,460
users is where you will add your

656
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,500
additional user your personal user with

657
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,860
your own personal password

658
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,539
once you log into the interface for the

659
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,900
first time

660
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,460
groups you can configure groups of users

661
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,799
and assign them different roles to

662
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,020
access certain parts of the interface so

663
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,179
this way you can

664
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:05,880
log in as your own personal user account

665
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,860
give yourself admin so you can create

666
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,740
new scans print scans run reports

667
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,980
you can say make your end user an

668
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,320
account on your instance that only has

669
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,360
view only privileges so you don't want

670
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,100
them to go in and delete scans and

671
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,440
delete old past history but they're able

672
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,600
to see the results of the scans and

673
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,918
generate reports for themselves

674
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,240
and that's detailed under here as well

675
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:34,980
performance you'll never really use much

676
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,279
of but it does show you

677
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,919
the database quantities and how long it

678
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:44,700
takes for like Benchmark scans

679
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,659
there's a trash can so if you

680
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:51,779
delete a task or a report something to

681
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:53,520
that effect it'll go into the trash can

682
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,679
here you can restore it from here or you

683
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,299
can click this empty trash button to

684
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:00,980
clear it out and free up some space

685
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,700
feed status shows you the current

686
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,080
databases that it pulls in and archives

687
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,640
it shows you the time stamp for each one

688
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,039
and the status

689
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:16,020
when you first install your green bone

690
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,779
and get it spun up and compiled when you

691
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:21,840
log in and go to create your user create

692
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,080
your user you go to feed status all of

693
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,580
these statuses will say update in

694
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,539
progress

695
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:29,580
and that's what I said we'll take

696
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,080
anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour

697
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,399
depending on the specs you gave the

698
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,620
workstation or instance

699
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,260
and you're not able to create any scans

700
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,600
or run any scans until that database

701
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,000
population is done you'll know it's done

702
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,320
when it says current year

703
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,640
and you're also able to put up

704
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,760
um ldap so you can link it to a domain

705
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,360
and radius for authentication as well

706
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,539
and they also offer a user manual and

707
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:02,159
calculators

708
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,919
and application info right on the help

709
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:07,700
category there

710
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:13,020
under your user settings you're able to

711
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,720
set things like time zone you're also

712
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,620
able to create custom filters which can

713
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,720
take and affect those overrides that we

714
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,820
could place earlier so you can have a

715
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,020
custom filter that automatically

716
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,960
excludes or applies those overrides for

717
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,419
a more concise easy reading of your

718
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:32,899
reports

719
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,760
so we'll go into one of these scans and

720
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,279
this is the one with the one single low

721
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,679
vulnerability

722
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:46,860
and you can see as we reviewed before it

723
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,860
does provide that information to you

724
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,200
and with references so you can review

725
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,880
other articles that reference that

726
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,159
vulnerability

727
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,419
you can go up here to this little

728
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:59,159
download button

729
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:01,860
and you can select the report format to

730
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,679
generate an actual document report so

731
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,480
this way you're able to provide it to

732
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,399
someone and not necessarily give them

733
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,559
access to this system to see those

734
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,860
results

735
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,600
this is what one of the reports looks

736
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,659
like uh some of us will look familiar if

737
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:24,360
you've used openvas in the past or know

738
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,640
someone that does

739
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,220
they have these General reports

740
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,100
it lists the name of the task and the

741
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,500
timestamp for the uh the task that was

742
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,000
run

743
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,620
it lists out the total vulnerabilities

744
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,120
of each one

745
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,620
and then it gets into details with

746
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,320
exactly what we saw in the

747
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,799
web interface but it's all recorded on

748
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,520
paper

749
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,140
you can also when generating the report

750
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,720
apply your overrides so it will exclude

751
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,640
certain vulnerabilities or anything that

752
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,419
you want to exclude

753
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,740
foreign

754
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:20,700
the

755
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,919
install instructions for greenbone

756
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:30,360
so you can go to their GitHub page

757
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,779
for all the documentation for how to set

758
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,620
up your own green bone

759
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,120
so they have their 22.4 this is our

760
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,100
brand newest version uh their stable

761
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,059
version

762
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:44,760
so we can click on that

763
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,500
and it tells you the same exact Hardware

764
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,659
requirements we went over earlier

765
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,940
and it'll break it down per platform of

766
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,860
what commands that you'll need

767
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,960
and it explains exactly each command

768
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,100
what you're doing and why you're doing

769
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,880
it

770
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,600
so they list out in pretty great detail

771
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,760
on exactly

772
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,500
how to get this working

773
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,960
they have a certificate there is one

774
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,699
manual part in there if you want to

775
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:11,940
automate the installation that you'll

776
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,980
need to add their signing certificate

777
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,379
the code signing certificate and as a

778
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:19,080
trusted certificate

779
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,280
and the entire uh compilation process

780
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,080
takes anywhere from

781
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,020
I'd say 30 minutes on the low end to

782
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,760
about 45 minutes if you're doing it

783
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,899
manually or for the first time

784
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,060
and once we get down to the end here

785
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,639
it does say performing a feed

786
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,159
synchronization so this is the commands

787
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,540
that tell it to pull in the newest

788
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,659
vulnerability feeds and apply them to

789
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:51,899
the databases that it spun up

790
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:54,418
and they have the commands there one

791
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:56,580
thing I did notice when you

792
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:01,020
compile uh greenbone from source is yeah

793
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,460
you'll pull in the feeds during the

794
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,359
install

795
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,920
but it doesn't tell you at all how to

796
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,599
keep those feeds updated

797
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,580
so if you don't know that you have to

798
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,460
keep the feeds updated they won't update

799
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,920
uh they will sit there and all of a

800
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,240
sudden you check in your feed status and

801
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,040
that your feeds are 100 days old and

802
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,200
you're not scanning for anything new

803
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
so what you could do is take these

804
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,300
commands from this green phone greenbone

805
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,420
nvt sync all the way down to the bottom

806
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,820
of the page this command here for gvmd

807
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,839
data

808
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,940
and you can put that in a script you can

809
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,040
automate that however you want so you

810
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,500
can put it in Quran I have mine running

811
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,440
2 am every night it'll pull in the

812
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,740
newest feeds even the community feeds

813
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,940
get updated

814
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,920
uh every business day

815
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,960
so you'll notice on weekends it'll say

816
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,839
two days old that's normal uh once

817
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,280
Monday comes around and it pulls the

818
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,079
updates again it'll go back to current

819
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,300
it tells you how to start the services

820
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,119
and then it walks through

821
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,760
how to get to the interface and logging

822
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,560
in for the first time

823
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,660
they also have that same information for

824
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,619
the old stable version 21.4

825
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:18,000
same process doesn't change too much

826
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,859
and same interface

827
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,540
now what I did was I did make my own

828
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,960
bash install script it is mostly

829
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,720
automated so

830
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,940
if needed I can provide a public link to

831
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,339
this and provide that

832
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:40,800
always a disclosure don't blindly run

833
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,900
other people's scripts I don't know you

834
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,240
that well you don't know me that well

835
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,920
please review my own code and make sure

836
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,599
it makes sense to you before you run it

837
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,640
and it goes through basically the whole

838
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,220
process as we just saw on the green bone

839
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,660
documentation feed

840
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,000
there is one manual part where you'll

841
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,720
need to trust their certificate

842
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,460
and put that in there

843
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,520
and once you exit out of gpg it'll just

844
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,200
continue the process

845
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,079
it gets down to the bottom I have it

846
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:16,619
running by default on Port 8080. it does

847
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:19,980
not do any SSL certificate handling but

848
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,020
you're welcome to do that yourself with

849
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,820
something like certbot let's encrypt

850
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,180
search certifications certificates

851
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,579
and it even tells you after it randomly

852
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:31,200
generates that password during the green

853
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,240
mode setup it puts it in a text file so

854
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,040
you can cut it out grab that password

855
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,000
and remove it

856
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,640
all right so now we've taken out a look

857
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,820
at a live instance of greenbone security

858
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,420
assistant greenbone does offer resources

859
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,720
and training on their systems and

860
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,660
software they also have a live demo that

861
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,040
they spun up themselves that you're

862
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,020
welcome to check out right now that's

863
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,359
livedemo.greenbone.net

864
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,579
and you can click continuous guests

865
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:24,960
it'll log you in and you can navigate

866
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,119
the interface get familiar with it

867
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,280
yourself take a look at the reports and

868
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,619
the scans that instance does reset

869
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:34,800
itself every so often

870
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,480
thank you

871
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,940
so as we mentioned earlier uh you'll

872
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,820
need to keep your feeds updated whether

873
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,400
it's running it manually you can stick

874
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,220
it in cron you can stick it in some

875
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,420
other

876
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,800
periodic

877
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,740
script running

878
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,359
also because it's on Linux make sure you

879
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:57,300
keep your underlying OS updated if it's

880
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,400
Debian make sure you install the latest

881
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,980
packages any other distro make sure you

882
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,380
have the latest packages

883
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,900
um I haven't encountered an issue yet

884
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,880
updating your underlying OS with

885
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,220
greenbone installed I have yet to break

886
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:14,160
it even though it's gone from Debian 10

887
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,099
to 11 now even through that major

888
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,680
versions shift I've had no issue with

889
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,380
greenbones installation

890
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,900
and I put some links up there you're

891
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,200
welcome to check out I put the GitHub

892
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,660
documentation for how to compile your

893
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,820
own greenbone Community Edition

894
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,480
also put some documentation for their

895
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,660
white papers user guides different PDFs

896
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,359
on comparing our products

897
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:44,460
the greenbone community forums very

898
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,560
helpful community

899
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,880
that I've had to check out several times

900
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,619
because I didn't know what I was looking

901
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:52,619
at at the time and they also offer free

902
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:54,300
courses on try hack me if you're

903
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,800
familiar with the website

904
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,280
you can sign up and if you visit that

905
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,560
link they give you a room code to plug

906
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,380
in to try hack me and they allow you to

907
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,900
spin up your own instances access like

908
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,599
the cloud service and it actually does

909
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,540
like a tutorial walks you through saying

910
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,420
you know check the scan on this IP what

911
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,300
is the CPE value of that report and it

912
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,579
actually walks you through grabbing that

913
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:21,900
information

914
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,599
so save that up here on screen for just

915
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,880
a minute so people can jot that down

916
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,260
take a snap of it if they want

917
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:32,900
and the try Hackney courses was actually

918
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,520
new to me when I was doing this

919
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,680
PowerPoint I had no idea I was stumbling

920
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,859
around on their website and found that

921
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:42,240
they were offering that so that's very

922
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,540
great

923
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:48,480
and if you need those links again come

924
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,119
see me I'm happy to provide them to you

925
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:52,560
uh again Jason truly with carnal

926
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,839
Technology Solutions I will go ahead and

927
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:57,359
open it up to any questions at the

928
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,320
moment

929
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,510
yes sir

930
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:05,809
[Music]

931
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,900
uh integrating it I don't believe they

932
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,920
have

933
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,440
any way to integrate it but I do believe

934
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,320
that you can run things alongside it if

935
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,960
you're able to get the tools as they

936
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,579
said in the documentation for compiling

937
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:26,880
it and it's a supported platform uh I've

938
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,720
had some good luck running for example

939
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,540
this and another web server on top of

940
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,640
this running concurrently as well so

941
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,680
you're always welcome to try it may not

942
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,300
be a supported uh solution and you can

943
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,680
always reach out to the forums if you

944
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,839
have any issues I'm sure there's many

945
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,119
other people in that scenario where they

946
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,800
run it alongside of something like PF

947
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,400
sends as well

948
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,000
yeah when you click on the vulnerability

949
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,300
it actually gives you the CVSs score

950
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,000
yeah and it details it in there you're

951
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,940
also able to they have links in there to

952
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,000
search on like volume DB for that type

953
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,040
of stuff as well and it gives you that

954
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,420
info as well

955
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,400
you're welcome

956
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,540
