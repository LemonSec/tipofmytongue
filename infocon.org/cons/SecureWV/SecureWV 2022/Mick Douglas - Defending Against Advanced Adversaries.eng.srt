37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,040
stuff works

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,380
um if time permits I'll point to two

39
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,780
unrelated projects what to log.com

40
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,759

log.com and we uh like make

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,740
recommendations on what you should be

43
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,479
logging and then there's a GitHub

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,600
project that we are in the process of

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,720
porting to.net we originally wrote it in

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,399
node as a proof of concept but now we're

47
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,079
moving it to.net called project

48
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,899
fantastic if you all ever heard of

49
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,700
solarwinds we are building an open

50
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,680
source alternative to it that will be

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,680
secure from the ground up so and it will

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,099
always have a free tier so check that

53

Virginia

88
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,040
pepperoni rolls that's their favorite

89
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,340
food and for the Internet you may have

90
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,860
put pepperoni in some bread dough but

91
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,379
that's not a pepperoni Roll come to West

92
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,920
Virginia try it you'll love it but all

93
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,879
right these slides are going to be

94
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,220
online I don't have the link yet because

95
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,519
they're not yet posted so um I'll tweet

96
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,340
uh when they're available so this talk

97
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,440
gonna be a little weird I'm really

98
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,900
frustrated I don't know about y'all but

99
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,640
I'm kind of tired of the same old same

100
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,780
old

101
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,780
every year we're having breaches over

102
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,920
and over

103
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,379
and it's old

104
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,900
I'm not happy about this but

105
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,019
I'm open source I don't mean like open

106
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,199
source code I mean

107
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,960
I've been breached so many times that

108
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,580
I've actually gone on the dark web and

109
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,400
found literally everything about me all

110
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,460
my health records on my everything like

111
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,080
all gone

112
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,840
so like I I don't even have anything in

113
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,400
in this fight anymore

114
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,680
and that's really weird

115
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,960
and I'm tired of it

116
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,000
and so what we're going to be talking

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,540
about today is what the reality of the

118
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,280
situation is we're doing economic

119
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,660
Warfare online it's not fair our current

120
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,540
defensive playbooks Don't Fit Don't work

121
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,340
and haven't for a very long time and I'm

122
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,800
going to be explaining why that is but

123
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,540
we can change the game and I don't want

124
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,060
you to give up so let's start diving in

125
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,139
here okay uh economic Warfare I know

126
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,940
that some of you probably aren't there

127
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,160
yet in terms of realizing that what's

128
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,080
going on is economic Warfare or maybe

129
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,120
your managers or your boss or future

130
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,880
employers aren't there yet here's how we

131
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,860
need to start framing this economic

132
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,340
Warfare is how countries go against each

133
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,259
other to harm the economies of others

134
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,660
and this definition comes from

135
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,440
Encyclopedia Britannica online and it's

136
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,960
the threat to use economic means against

137
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,460
the country in order to weaken its

138
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,960
economy and thereby reduce its political

139
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,639
and military power

140
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,979
and I actually want to say thank you for

141
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:45,780
yesterday's keynote because I was going

142
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,699
to be talking all about the Conti group

143
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,160
and how they shifted to helping Russia

144
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,320
but now I've been saved having to do

145
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,500
that and that's good and for those of

146
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,960
you who didn't see that go check out the

147
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,440
other keynote from yesterday's quality

148
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,560
but further defining it it's denying the

149
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,300
adversary access to necessary physical

150
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,539
Financial technological resources or by

151
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,060
Otherwise inhibiting its ability to

152
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,620
benefit from trade financial and

153
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,300
technological exchanges with other

154
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,100
countries highlighting this a bit

155
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,139
denying the adversary access to

156
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,180
technological resources inhibiting its

157
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,639
ability to defend from Technologic or

158
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,479
benefit from technological exchanges

159
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,280
how's that for hitting on the nose

160
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,479
and this is what gets me

161
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,580
I'm a consultant and have been for a

162
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,620
very long time and a lot of orgs they're

163
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,419
like well not us we're not a Target

164
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,400
I politely beg to differ

165
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,319
if you go on my LinkedIn you will see

166
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,039
that I used to work at oclc

167
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,680
oclc stands for online computer lab

168
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,479
library center

169
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:01,800
it's a not-for-profit library exchange

170
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,280
system

171
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,960
libraries

172
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,020
and we were getting hit all the time

173
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,300
we were stopping off point

174
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,220
for other libraries other institutions

175
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,020
that had lowered their firewalls because

176
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,660
people were using our services

177
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,419
and if we a lot folks libraries make the

178
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,720
money on late fees if we're a Target you

179
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,280
are too

180
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,639
and I'm here to tell you it's not fair

181
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,560
I got into computers and networking

182
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,840
because I like telephony

183
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,900
in the 90s when they were deregulating

184
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,400
the long distance phone stuff I was like

185
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,099
man that's cool and I went into phones

186
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:43,680
and networking and I had a ball

187
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,560
and at some point geopolitics landed on

188
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,720
my hobby

189
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,759
and that was pretty weird

190
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,240
so

191
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,259
what we need to start thinking about is

192
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:59,580
reframing this entire conversation about

193
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,740
who we are what we do and what our jobs

194
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,139
are

195
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,180
now this is going to be a real weird

196
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,979
concept for you and in a moment I'm

197
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,120
going to have some little audience

198
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,759
participation okay so get ready

199
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,020
but

200
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,060
what you need to be thinking about is

201
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,060
that this is asymmetric economic warfare

202
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,979
that's happening

203
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:21,180
all right this is the audience

204
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,759
participation Point does anybody know

205
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,979
what the going rate is for a distributed

206
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,960
denial of service

207
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,120
where you're doing a volume of one

208
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,360
gigabit per second for one hour how much

209
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,000
does that cost if you go and rent a

210
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,240
botnet or go to a dark web provider that

211
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,700
specializes in this how much does it

212
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,899
cost

213
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,760
two hundred dollars an hour how many

214
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,100
other votes other guesses

215
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,700
60. I hear 60 200 what else

216
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,339
ten what else

217
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,459
five all right well

218
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:58,560
one dollar Bob okay we're not doing the

219
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,360
prices right we're not doing the

220
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,380
processary

221
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,760
okay so the the answer 10 was right a

222
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,860
couple years ago but inflation has hit

223
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,360
and it's now twenty dollars an hour

224
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,100
times it's tough for the attackers

225
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,180
twenty dollars an hour

226
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,779
you see one of the problems that we have

227
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,000
is that the adversaries have tooling and

228
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,820
capability that far outstrips what we

229
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,760
think they have and we defend against

230
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,200
what we think they have

231
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,399
Little Wonder they're kicking our teeth

232
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,420
in

233
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,100
I don't know if you ever have

234
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,959
investigated the usability of some of

235
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,360
the attacker tools but they far outstrip

236
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,360
many of the defensive and administrative

237
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,779
tools that we have one of the the tool I

238
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,540
won't or just tangentially mentioned in

239
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,240
the official talk project fantastic it's

240
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,980
a management tool that we're releasing

241
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,260
my company for free one of the reasons

242
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,240
that we're doing that is that we want to

243
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,399
make managing systems at least as easy

244
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,279
as it is to use the attacker tools

245
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,260
if you don't believe me go out and look

246
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,019
at a tool called Poison Ivy it's an old

247
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,880
attack tool but it keeps on getting

248
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,640
repurposed and rebuilt it was used to a

249
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,060
very very devastating attack in 2019 as

250
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,760
late as 2019. look at the usability of

251
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,500
that tool

252
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,040
it's fall out the chair easy to use very

253
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,360
feature Rich

254
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,540
so attackers twenty dollars an hour what

255
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,800
do you get for twenty dollars an hour

256
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,680
you get over sixty thousand dollars of

257
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,380
damages on average

258
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,540
there's a tax where that twenty dollars

259
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,599
will net you two million dollars

260
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,260
it's not fair

261
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,420
Now read in the room like I am right now

262
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,640
everybody's like well maybe I need to go

263
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,920
into the offensive arts or I need to go

264
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,620
do something else okay well hold up

265
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,720
there okay

266
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,760
we need to we need to chat a little bit

267
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,980
about what what's happening okay have

268
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,200
you folks heard about Pandora's Box that

269
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,940
parable

270
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,459
opens up that box and all the evils

271
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:18,060
spill out right and there is evil in the

272
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,040
world

273
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,920
and the Cyber realm is no different than

274
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,440
the real realm in this Regard in fact

275
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,100
it's a little honest

276
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,200
the internet's an open sewer right it

277
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,959
just is so but there's evil in the world

278
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,300
and there are Advanced actors that are

279
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,700
trying to have their Narrative of the

280
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,000
world play out North Korea they're doing

281
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,700
all kinds of crazy stuff online you talk

282
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,560
about asymmetric Warfare they've got

283
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,279
like 12 or 24 IPS that are public facing

284
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,700
they do most of their attacks from China

285
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,860
but they're doing their attacks China's

286
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,959
doing their attacks we've got all these

287
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,339
targets

288
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,000
you know in Putin right like these folks

289
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,880
are evil I don't want them to win so the

290
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,519
whole point of this talk is for us to

291
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,980
have a real conversation that we have to

292
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,260
admit that we got to start Shifting The

293
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,240
Narrative and you know

294
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,040
whenever I start thinking about evil I

295
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,779
think okay well how do we counter it and

296
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,640
what's the what's the deal

297
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,380
I love this quote the only thing

298
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,839
necessary for the Triumph of evil is for

299
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,120
good men to do nothing

300
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,600
so what is our industry doing are we

301
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,160
doing nothing

302
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,440
the answer is no we are doing some

303
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,680
things but we're not doing enough

304
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,180
and

305
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,700
you know I'm sure that some of this is

306
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,639
going to hit close to you and I I would

307
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,860
be a hypocrite at the highest order if I

308
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,600
didn't raise my hand and say that I fell

309
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,459
victim to some of these things too but

310
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,160
there are plenty of times that we don't

311
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,920
rise to the occasion

312
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,200
you know and you might have heard this

313
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,300
like but my job is so hard I got so much

314
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,500
to do

315
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,260
okay right

316
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,319
um

317
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,560
don't take this the wrong way but like

318
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,480
this might be your truth I don't know

319
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,279
but this is mine

320
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,660
in a couple weeks I'm going to be going

321
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,220
home and having Thanksgiving with my

322
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,480
family

323
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,700
and they're going to ask hey how's your

324
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,019
job and I'm going to say hey it's

325
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,980
awesome it's great because it is but

326
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,300
it's not perfect you know I'm not

327
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,820
clicking my heels going to work but

328
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,800
you know I'm the first gen college grad

329
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,680
most of my family worked or retired from

330
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,220
the steel mill in Canton and their bad

331
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,899
day

332
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,839
I can't even fathom right like my bad

333
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,200
day oh the dinner she's stale you know I

334
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,800
mean I work hard but my worst day is

335
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,320
their best day ever and so one of the

336
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,120
things I just don't understand is like I

337
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,100
teach jobs like you have the option

338
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,139
enjoy your desk job make the best of it

339
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,959
you can or Draw 25 we're all like it's

340
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,620
so tough

341
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,740
it is not I'm politely magnificent and

342
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,720
you know judging by the laughs a lot if

343
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,060
you agree you know go back far enough in

344
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,380
your family tree you will find that your

345
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,779
ancestors would do all kinds of unseemly

346
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,639
things to have a climate control job

347
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,860
where they could even just sit

348
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,980
so I don't know you know here's another

349
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,260
thought pattern that I want to charge

350
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,760
against you don't have to be great at

351
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,320
cyber security you just have to outrun

352
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,360
your peer organizations that whole joke

353
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,399
of you know you don't have to outrun the

354
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,560
bear you just have to outrun

355
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,420
the person you're hiking with okay if

356
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,920
anybody ever says that don't go hiking

357
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,240
with them they're not your friend that's

358
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,639
one but two that's not how it works okay

359
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:46,139
there are attackers who are optimistic

360
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:47,940
and will go for whoever

361
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,160
they exist

362
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,500
those are not the attackers that should

363
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,540
keep you up at night

364
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,339
the attackers that should be keeping you

365
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:58,380
up at night are the ones that are gonna

366
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,199
for you and only you and it doesn't

367
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,199
matter what anybody else is doing or you

368
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,120
and only you

369
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,639
and there's not a thing that you can do

370
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,620
to dissuade them because you're the

371
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,360
target for whatever reason I don't know

372
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,100
maybe you're a business partner with the

373
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,260
ultimate Target

374
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,360
but they have their sights set on you

375
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,980
and this is something that just drives

376
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,360
me up the wall because a lot of people

377
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,639
say oh all we have to do is be slightly

378
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,260
above average for a market vertical

379
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,699
another thing that we need to push

380
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:31,500
against this

381
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,260
is every time I hear this it's from a

382
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,180
market vertical where that's not a good

383
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,100
bar

384
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,019
every Healthcare place that I go to

385
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:41,100
they're like well we just have to be

386
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,420
better than the one down there oh you

387
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,820
mean when the guy hit with ransomware

388
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,459
you know like it you don't want to set

389
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,800
your your aim that low you can and

390
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,779
should be doing better

391
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,540
I did what the vendor told me I just

392
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,040
bought security well that that doesn't

393
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,620
work but we were compliant we were

394
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,779
following all the security guides

395
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:03,360
okay we were following industry best

396
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,120
practices whatever that means I mean I

397
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,040
got to be brutally honest as a

398
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,420
consultant that is one of the hardest

399
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,399
things to figure out when I'm setting an

400
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,620
engagement if you want industry best

401
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,420
practices we'll get you there but it's

402
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,480
tough what do you mean by that

403
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,000
so what I'm going to do

404
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,920
is I'm going to explain

405
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,320
how attackers do what they do so that

406
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,880
you can see what the table Stakes

407
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,399
actually are

408
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,500
all right so here's what attackers do

409
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,019
now I want to be clear I'm not an

410
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,779
attacker it's been several years since

411
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:40,500
I've done this but not too long ago I

412
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,240
actually infiltrated different attacker

413
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,399
groups I created Shadow accounts and

414
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,920
worked up reputation I didn't violate

415
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,139
any laws or nothing at least

416
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,480
not in the regions that I was operating

417
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,040
in

418
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,040
and got into these groups got up enough

419
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,480
credit and I saw what they were doing

420
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,060
and you know if you read the Conte again

421
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,940
thank you for not having to go over all

422
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,380
of this but if you read the content

423
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,059
group like you'll see that there's this

424
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,220
pattern and this is what my company does

425
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,099
okay uh like we're very defensive

426
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,559
focused but we also believe that to be a

427
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,119
good Defender you got to have sharp

428
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,919
claws and teeth and so we do pen tests

429
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:20,819
and we do different assault type work so

430
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,079
what I'm going to do is walk you through

431
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,359
our Playbook it's informed on what

432
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,619
attackers do

433
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:28,500
and I can't say for Authority for

434
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,000
certain that the attackers are doing

435
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,080
this but if they don't I'm

436
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,720
embarrassed by the attacker so here let

437
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,880
me walk you through how we would do an

438
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,799
engagement and

439
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,080
it's going to be anticlimactic

440
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,700
if you've never done offensive work

441
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,900
you're going to be shocked at how

442
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,880
anticlimactic it is

443
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,880
step one hey Google tell me the open

444
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,400
cyber security jobs in Charleston show

445
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,760
me the open security jobs for

446
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,380
organization whatever right whatever I'm

447
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,140
shooting for and I did this just last

448
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,500
night and I got this job posting and

449
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,440
here I want to highlight that right uh

450
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,460
in the element is experience with um

451
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,980
next-gen antivirus products crowdstrike

452
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,980
and Sentinel one

453
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,140
cool

454
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,020
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to

455
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,679
go into my lab and actually

456
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,360
let's see if this works here

457
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,559
we're doing all right on time

458
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,360
um well I'm on my MiFi not a no um so uh

459
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,520
what what I've done is I've vpned into

460
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,140
my uh office and we have a very uh

461
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,539
capable

462
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:53,220
proxmox lab environment it cost us about

463
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,340
17 grand to put all this together three

464
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,419
nodes working in concert with a Naz so

465
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,000
let me zoom in here

466
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,679
you have 136 CPU core with what that's a

467
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,860
just over a quarter terabyte of memory

468
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,880
and

469
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,039
got a couple terabytes of storage with

470
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,340
that capability we can emulate most

471
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,980
small office well actually any small

472
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,440
office and a sizable portion of any

473
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,360
organization like we can say here's the

474
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,580
workstations here's the DMZ here's the

475
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,220
stuff we use scripts to instantiate this

476
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,700
all and once you make the templates

477
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,440
then I'm going to be clear that's the

478
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,299
tricky bit is making the template VM

479
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,740
once you have those templates done you

480
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,380
can instantiate them and it takes I

481
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,440
don't know 20 20 minutes or so and I've

482
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,760
got a network of 50 70 machines

483
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,860
and then what I do

484
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,500
this this is the tricky bed

485
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,360
then what I do is I call the different

486
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,000
security vendors I want to be clear I

487
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,460
don't lie

488
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,880
man I come close what I do is I call the

489
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,559
security vendor and I say hi my name is

490
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,200
Mick Douglass and I'm the owner of a

491
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,780
security company and I'd like to try out

492
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,760
your product

493
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,620
now

494
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,020
that's not a lie

495
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,460
okay

496
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,140
we're having different definitions of

497
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,419
what I mean by try out your product no

498
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,700
and so what the sales person does is

499
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,380
they're like sure we can set you up with

500
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,320
whatever 90-day trial and I'm like sweet

501
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,020
let's do this I installed their agent I

502
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,120
installed or whatever you know sometimes

503
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,860
it's a cloud thing and I can't do it in

504
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,299
my own lab I gotta use their Cloud

505
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:40,140
instance and then for 90 days I try that

506
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,419
product

507
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:46,140
and it has a real rough day and I here's

508
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,179
here's the thing that um those of you

509
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:49,679
how many raise your hand those of you

510
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,960
who want to be pen testers or thinking

511
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,620
about doing pen testing all right

512
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,660
this is one thing that I wish somebody

513
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,360
told me earlier in my career

514
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,960
there is a grind to pen testing

515
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,940
folks who are pen testers or have been

516
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,100
pen testers am I speaking truth

517
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,340
it is you are throwing stuff on the wall

518
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,740
and seeing what sticks and what I'm

519
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,440
doing is in my lab I am testing I'm

520
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,080
testing I'm testing and it'll be dozens

521
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,539
hundreds thousands of iterations until I

522
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,400
find out what it takes to slide below

523
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,900
the radar

524
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,559
once I have that though then I do it on

525
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,900
the network that counts the target the

526
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,320
victim the you know client

527
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,520
so

528
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,500
every defensive control can be bypassed

529
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,140
not on the first time though

530
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,280
and so what I do what my crew does is we

531
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,260
figure out how to bypass these controls

532
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,059
figure out what it does like what's

533
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,980
needed and then once we've got it then

534
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,760
we can do it for real and

535
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,659
um

536
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,360
you know I gotta be very clear about

537
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,480
this like it will take us

538
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,000
you know sometimes days or weeks to

539
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,220
figure out how to bypass that thing

540
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,220
and I I want to be clear uh not just

541
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,200
signature based things but heuristics

542
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,020
machine learning AI all of it you can

543
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,820
bypass you can it's just a matter of

544
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,120
figuring out what the magic combo is

545
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,100
so with that

546
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,240
we can get in

547
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,700
so

548
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,520
I want to recap of where we're at okay

549
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,760
so the attackers are well funded that

550
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,460
was covered in yesterday's Keynote the

551
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,260
other thing is they have a single Focus

552
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,620
we as practitioners have to do our

553
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,179
day-to-day work we have to do all our

554
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:49,679
project work and oh yeah we got to be

555
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,960
watching the wall and that that's too

556
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,900
much but the problem is there's not

557
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,220
enough of us

558
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,440
globally there's something like 4

559
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,679
million it security practitioners across

560
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,020
all skill levels did you know that

561
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,700
there's something like three point

562
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,780
something million uh openings so four

563
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,880
million practitioners

564
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,299
three million openings

565
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:16,500
right

566
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,419
if you feel like you're overworked you

567
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:19,740
are

568
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,919
so don't beat yourself up just dust

569
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:26,340
yourself up try another day

570
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,020
here's where things kind of Hop the

571
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,720
rails though okay the attackers know

572
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,400
your defenses I just showed you how to

573
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,280
do it hey Google do this you know show

574
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,240
Dan

575
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,559
there's plenty of ways to figure out

576
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,140
what an org has if you do just a little

577
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,559
bit of Recon You're Gonna Know

578
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,039
then they figured out how to bypass that

579
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,700
so are attackers getting in yes

580
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,620
yes they are

581
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,820
and

582
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,240
you know wanting for nothing I I used to

583
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,120
be a full-time pen tester

584
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,520
and enough times going by I can name

585
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,539
names

586
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,520
um I used to be the one of the team

587
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,740
leads at Bank of America

588
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,600
and

589
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,940
I never wrote a report hey you kept us

590
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,260
out

591
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,580
hmm

592
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,500
Bank of America's Got Money Bank of

593
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,960
America's Got like 1300 employees doing

594
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,419
nothing but infosec

595
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,460
I'm better than average but I am not

596
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,440
like

597
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,039
that good I'm just tenacious I'm like

598
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,320
willing to pay that tedious price pay

599
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,720
that tedious tax to get in if somebody

600
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,360
like me can do it

601
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,400
there's other folks who can do it I

602
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,419
assure you

603
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:42,539
so what we need to understand is that

604
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:47,059
it's not a fair fight

605
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,700
so

606
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,860
shift things up

607
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,659
you know like if you're getting your

608
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,640
teeth kicked in over and over again when

609
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,419
you go down a like a particular Alleyway

610
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:01,799
call me stupid but at a certain point

611
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:02,760
I'm gonna be like you know what I'm

612
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,020
going to take the longer way I'm not

613
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,520
going down that alley way to get my

614
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,260
teeth kicked in no more

615
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,179
right so

616
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:12,360
start shifting things up

617
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,940
now I want to be clear you still have to

618
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,340
do the basics and stuff like what you're

619
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,380
cyber insurance

620
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,360
policies require of you and your

621
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,679
different regulatory Frameworks and

622
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:24,840
stuff you have to do those but I want to

623
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,159
be very clear

624
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,039
I I download the nist standards I

625
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,799
download the disa stigs I test in my lab

626
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,179
to figure out how to attack against

627
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:37,140
those systems okay it's awesome if you

628
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,659
have a lab in your home you should set

629
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:41,340
that up but eventually once you start

630
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,440
getting those you know

631
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,179
I want to call an easier because that's

632
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:48,240
way judgy but like the earlier attacks

633
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,320
where you're going against a machine

634
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,880
that doesn't have firewalls and stuff

635
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,039
then start hardening the machine and see

636
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,440
figure out how you can deal with that

637
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,260
next ramp up okay so

638
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,020
we still have to do those basics

639
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,120
and I think that what we need to have a

640
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,700
conversation with is you know when I

641
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,900
want to get political because this dude

642
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,940
is intensely political but he did spout

643
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,039
some crazy good quotes

644
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,720
you go to the arm you go to war with the

645
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,340
Army you have not the Army you might

646
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,020
want or wish to have at a later time

647
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,679
Donald Rumsfeld so what we need to start

648
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,919
doing is using the army that we have the

649
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,039
capabilities and resources

650
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,159
much better so to that end folks

651
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:30,840
I'm going to introduce you to one of the

652
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,900
most potent and feared weapons in the

653
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,640
infosec industry you ready

654
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,520
okay now earlier I asked are there a lot

655
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,020
of folks who are just getting started

656
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,820
out in their journey in infosec and a

657
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,620
lot of hands went up those of you who

658
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,440
have been doing infosec for a while

659
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,260
Excel do you live in it like I feel I

660
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,299
live in Excel

661
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,340
okay

662
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,120
CSV files yeah it's Excel the CSV files

663
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,340
what's the comment so Excel so what I'm

664
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,020
going to do is walk you through this is

665
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,480
another audience participation spot I'm

666
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,980
going to walk you through a concept

667
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,159
called balance scorecards

668
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:16,440
take notes of this ask questions this I

669
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,340
charge

670
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,380
a whole lot of money for this so this is

671
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,600
a freebie this is how we do what we do

672
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,740
okay

673
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,299
what I'm gonna do

674
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:28,100
Let's uh let's do one live

675
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,260
okay good

676
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,799
all right

677
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,860
um

678
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,100
oh that's way too small let's fix that

679
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,480
all right what I'm going to do is I I

680
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,580
just want you all to shout out some uh

681
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,640
host based controls

682
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,080
like what is something that you would

683
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,700
expect there to be on a host whether

684
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,220
it's a server desktop laptop whatever

685
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,080
what would you have

686
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,860
EDR all right EDR

687
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,260
AV okay what else

688
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,559
firewall host firewall

689
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:17,220
uh host uh IPS

690
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,980
uh so I'll uh host uh intrusion

691
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,620
prevention system hips uh for those of

692
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,640
you who aren't familiar with it it's

693
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,020
kind of like a

694
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,760
paired back EDR and I would say

695
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,419
um what else

696
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,679
log monitoring all right I like that

697
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,580
um a question is Group Policy uh

698
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,260
normally I would put that on like a

699
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,900
system hardening which I think is fair

700
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,260
okay anything else

701
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,659
okay application white listing uh

702
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,419
sometimes called application control

703
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:59,460
um I don't get too PC on it the reason I

704
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,760
call it application control is um I was

705
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,240
in a on a panel once and somebody was

706
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,039
talking about application white listing

707
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:10,200
and blacklisting me being me I had to

708
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,520
ask the dumb question I was like what

709
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,900
about the apps that are sometimes

710
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,880
allowed there's this brief pause and

711
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,679
you're like well it's uh

712
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:19,260
gray list and then we started having

713
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,059
this like what shade of gray so I just

714
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,700
call it app control

715
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,200
but I'll use app white listening because

716
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,640
a lot of the Frameworks still call it

717
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,419
that

718
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:30,120
um let's let's uh just for fun let's put

719
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,799
DLP in there

720
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:36,419
okay so here's here's like what we got

721
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:38,700
potentially to work with at the host

722
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,720
layer

723
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,220
so

724
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,799
um what I would do then

725
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,740
is I would put all the network stuff

726
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,279
you know like firewall

727
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,380
uh

728
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,200
uh Network intrusion detection system

729
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,460
you know etc etc right then in column A

730
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,440
what you're going to do and this is

731
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,720
dealer's choice this is up to you you

732
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,240
can put your phone scan findings here

733
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,159
you could put

734
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:08,940
um

735
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,120
like pen test report findings here if

736
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,220
you don't yet have one of those what you

737
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,980
could do I suppose you could go to

738
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,020
um

739
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,880
uh

740
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,360
attack at miter and pick a particular

741
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,460
phrase that you're worried about for

742
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,200
whatever reason

743
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,179
if you're worried about a particular

744
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:32,220
group what you would do is go to a group

745
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,600
and I'm just going to pick

746
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,120
apt-38 they do a lot of work in

747
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,620
um

748
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,260
Russia

749
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,220
um

750
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:50,520
there's 29 which I think is

751
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,100
North Korea I forget I don't I'm not

752
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,720
good at remembering the numbers or

753
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,940
whatever but like you know who's gone in

754
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,799
for you potentially you can use these as

755
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,559
like kind of a starting off point and

756
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,419
what you're going to do is you're going

757
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:04,260
to say

758
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,580
um

759
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,799
well let's do

760
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,279
um let's do a remote access toolkit

761
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,919
so commonly called a rat remote access

762
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,260
toolkit and then what you're going to do

763
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,700
is you're going to walk through these

764
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,320
different elements and this is the

765
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,260
audience participation part okay would

766
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,658
an EDR stop a remote access toolkit

767
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,140
should yeah so let's mark it as a yes

768
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,200
now I like that should let's kind of

769
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,419
take a pause here for a second

770
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:39,179
what you ideally will do is fill this

771
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:40,740
out and then you're going to double

772
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,200
check with like a highly focused pen

773
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,159
test or some kind of security stack QA

774
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,500
right but we're just trying to see the

775
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,140
realm of possible here would antivirus

776
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,860
stop a rat

777
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,140
I'm going to Mark Maybe

778
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,140
because evading antivirus actually is

779
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,240
shockingly easy

780
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,860
um

781
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,380
I don't have time to do a demo uh check

782
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,720
out a tool called Defender check

783
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,340
um if you're not familiar with this tool

784
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,740
it is amazing it's when when somebody

785
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,179
told me about this tool I was like of

786
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:20,039
course that's how you do this uh you

787
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,960
take known malware you give it to

788
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,760
Defender check Defender check sends it

789
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,799
to defender or whatever antivirus

790
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,899
solution you got and it says hey is this

791
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:31,440
malware in the AV says yes it is and

792
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,120
then what Defender check does it says

793
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,159
thank you splits the file into and gives

794
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:37,679
is this malware no okay what about this

795
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,539
is this malware yes

796
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:42,059
what about these two blocks is this

797
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:44,820
malware nope this is yes keeps on

798
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,260
breaking them down into smaller smaller

799
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,880
components until it says this is the

800
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,760
malware here here and um those of you

801
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,380
who are like yeah but my heuristic space

802
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:56,299
tools no no because Defender check tools

803
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:58,980
uh heuristic space things are usually

804
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,380
catching like particular API calls or

805
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,179
arguments being sent to those apis

806
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:05,039
Defender check will

807
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,899
usually get you within spitting distance

808
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:08,520
so

809
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,240
um

810
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,980
so we're going to mark that as a maybe

811
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,720
well uh so the comment is you can't use

812
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,640
that malware anymore uh actually what

813
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,559
you would do is you would take that

814
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:22,860
malware modify it lightly until it's

815
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,659
still functionally the same but it no

816
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:27,120
longer matches and I want to be clear

817
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,519
okay we're doing fine I can

818
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,059
so um not to toot my own horn but I

819
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:34,679
wrote power cat I was the original

820
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,200
author of power cat and for years and

821
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,059
years no antivirus caught it and then

822
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:43,140
finally one day I I had a script that

823
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,760
was just periodically checking and

824
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,380
finally one day it was like Hey Mick

825
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,360
power cats malware and I was like thank

826
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,179
you which I know that's a weird take but

827
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:53,340
I was actually happy at that point so

828
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,260
then I it wasn't Defender check it was a

829
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,600
different tool but I did that same thing

830
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,000
folks

831
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,760
you have to QA check your software your

832
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,500
security software

833
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,179
um the vendor was detecting powercat

834
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:12,179
after I ran the comparable checks what

835
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,918
it said is

836
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,918
um

837
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,719
it was detecting on two things the first

838
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,699
item was what is the file name is it

839
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:25,020
powercat.ps1 and then the other

840
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,820
detection is do you have a variable

841
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,060
called dollar sign port

842
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:35,460
and so I changed it to dollar sign fort

843
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,139
and then I changed the file name to

844
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,780
something else which had an F in it as

845
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,040
well

846
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,899
and there's a vendor that I will never

847
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:44,820
ever be able to get a job at if my

848
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,560
company folds because I wrote them an

849
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,219
email that

850
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,500
in tone was kind of like this Dear Sir

851
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,940
or Madam I want to let you know that

852
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,159
this email I'm writing you I'm only

853
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,099
doing so with my middle fingers

854
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:01,260
and like it just excoriated them for

855
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,180
their stuff so test these sorts of

856
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,000
things all right remote access toolkit

857
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,119
tangent over uh remote access toolkit

858
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,579
would a host firewall prevent that from

859
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,760
working

860
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,240
if it's well configured

861
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,020
what do you think

862
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:28,140
default so let's mark it as a maybe

863
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,300
okay what about a host intrusion

864
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,980
prevention system yeah I would hope yeah

865
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,240
lob monitoring would you see a remote

866
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,820
access toolkit

867
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,460
I would say yeah you might not see the

868
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,140
actual attack but you would be seeing

869
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,839
like a weird change or some expected

870
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,480
thing uh another side tangent get ready

871
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,500
for this

872
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,480
um how many folks raise your hand do you

873
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,720
have a change management process at work

874
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,880
okay keep your hand up if you like your

875
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,040
change management process

876
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,380
oh okay you do kinda all right we'll

877
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,680
chat after because I need some pointers

878
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,079
um I hate them I start they're painful

879
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,839
make it work make it worth it um if you

880
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,400
have a change management process look

881
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,859
for unexpected changes attackers like me

882
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:16,560
will change configurations on machines

883
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,680
so uh system hardening remote access

884
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,260
toolkit yeah it usually will actually

885
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,780
dollar for dollar uh system hardening is

886
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,800
pretty good app control yes DLP no right

887
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,119
so what you're going to do is you're

888
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,500
going to fill this through keep on

889
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,000
filling it out

890
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,400
go go to your next thing um maybe

891
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,940
they've got like some kind of uh implant

892
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,920
you know you just fill it out Yes No

893
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,640
Maybe So then

894
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,520
here's the tricky part okay

895
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,040
tricky what you're going to do is

896
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,380
something like this and let me zoom in

897
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,940
so you can see the magic happen

898
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,380
equals

899
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,440
count if

900
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,800
B what would that be be two to be

901
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:12,359
oh just do B to B okay b b

902
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:15,859
oh yeah dollars thank you

903
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:20,040
and then my criteria

904
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,880
yes

905
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,240
[Music]

906
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,980
yes well there's a circular reference

907
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,420
yeah

908
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,740
yeah yeah I'll fix that that's easy

909
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,440
well we could we could fix that we can

910
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,820
fix that

911
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,359
um

912
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,400
okay we'll just put that little logic

913
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,060
right over here

914
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,700
uh yeah we would have to start at B

915
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,319
you know let's just do B2

916
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,780
and then I'm just gonna okay I'm having

917
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,579
demo computers

918
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:03,000
I can't Excel y'all but let's let's just

919
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,500
go easy because I'm rattled

920
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,599
okay so what you would do is you would

921
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,400
have here's all your yeses here's all

922
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,980
and then you would you would also count

923
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,400
your nose nose don't count for anything

924
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,619
your yeses I usually give like a point

925
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:22,500
value of five and then my maybes I give

926
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,660
a point value of three okay let me go

927
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,119
back to my

928
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,240
oops Let's uh let's go back to this

929
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,359
all right

930
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:38,940
so you saw how to do it

931
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,680
let me ask this before I go to the next

932
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,859
slide was that difficult

933
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:46,500
no no I think in the grand scheme of

934
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,839
things it's not that difficult

935
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:51,000
um what you're going to do you build out

936
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,200
your host controls or your network

937
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,060
controls then you fill in the attacks

938
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,400
then you just start you know the

939
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,740
question of gridded the you know a cell

940
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:02,339
at a time does this work yes no maybe so

941
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,920
and eventually you start getting like

942
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,660
you know a grid it looks something like

943
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,920
that

944
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,260
um by the way the um text there I

945
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,880
deliberately graded out because the

946
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,680
attack elements isn't the important bit

947
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,359
I want you to focus on this whole grid

948
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,140
this Matrix that we're building okay now

949
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,820
don't try to do this all in one

950
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,280
afternoon that's the important thing

951
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,200
because it would be a very dull dull

952
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,440
afternoon what what I do with my clients

953
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,660
is I sit down for like a half hour an

954
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,000
hour once a week and we start building

955
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,900
out things that look a little like this

956
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:41,040
okay once you have this

957
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,440
then some very cool magic starts

958
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,380
happening all right what I will do is

959
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,700
and I realize that you're not going to

960
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,900
be able to see this but I was kind of

961
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,359
hinting at it with that formula using

962
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,800
that countif

963
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,560
what I'll do is I'll build a grand total

964
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,579
score for that particular column again

965
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:02,760
yeses get five maybe he's get three and

966
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,740
no points for no by the way those Point

967
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,839
values are completely arbitrary if you

968
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:08,579
want a different point value knock

969
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:10,140
yourself out

970
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,480
what I do then once I have my grand

971
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,300
totals for all the columns is I select

972
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:19,260
that row and I do a color gradient

973
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,700
lowest score Red highest score Green

974
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,820
and now it becomes very easy to start

975
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,440
looking at your stack and saying hey

976
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,260
some controls here are working great

977
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,180
system hardening really saved the day

978
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:37,619
edrs did great this this went well here

979
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:39,300
those of you who are just getting

980
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,220
started out in your infosec journey I

981
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,660
would encourage you to try building one

982
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,339
of these you will find that there are

983
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:46,859
certain tools or technologies that work

984
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:48,599
really well that might be something you

985
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:50,040
want to focus in on

986
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,140
there's going to be demand for that

987
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,440
control

988
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,480
if you are working at an org and you

989
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,040
you're like oh wouldn't it be great if

990
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,119
we had

991
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:02,700
solution X or this other product or this

992
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,280
new Tech Tool you could do this analysis

993
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,680
to see would life be better is it worth

994
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,599
it having that tool

995
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,940
so this is a very powerful and fun thing

996
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,440
to do well

997
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,380
helpful I wouldn't say fun I'd be lying

998
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,260
it it's it's there's a reward there but

999
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,020
uh

1000
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,500
it's not camping or hiking but here's

1001
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,380
where things also get very very

1002
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,820
interesting though

1003
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,980
you can start seeing that some controls

1004
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,980
aren't doing well

1005
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,200
surprise surprise antivirus is not going

1006
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,359
to save the day now you need to have

1007
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,099
antivirus

1008
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,660
it's kind of like that clown at the

1009
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,160
amusement park you gotta be this High to

1010
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,160
ride the ride but it's not going to stop

1011
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,680
most advanced attackers

1012
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,240
but

1013
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,400
start trying to find out what controls

1014
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,619
you have that aren't working well if you

1015
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:57,180
really want a curry Management's favor

1016
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,800
or if you're in management pay attention

1017
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,920
to this next little Pro tip what I love

1018
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,380
to do is I will do this analysis for my

1019
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,460
clients

1020
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,560
and then when license renewal comes up

1021
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,280
with that particular vendor I say hey

1022
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,320
just picking on the end of orders

1023
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,060
because I've been talking about it a

1024
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,119
antivirus vendor we are spending 15

1025
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,300
percent of our licensing across our

1026
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,800
entire

1027
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,040
like license costs on you and you're

1028
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,980
stopping across this group that we did

1029
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:33,000
the analysis on you stopped five percent

1030
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,579
how about we get a discount

1031
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:37,619
and I know this sounds really Bonkers

1032
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:40,380
but we have had my company has had many

1033
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,359
instances where we saved the

1034
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:44,940
organization our entire consulting fee

1035
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,960
by doing this because oh we didn't

1036
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,940
realize we were weren't helping you out

1037
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,440
that much let's

1038
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,440
let's work okay

1039
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,720
but this is the bit that not many people

1040
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,119
are talking about

1041
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,520
remember column A the stuff that you're

1042
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,839
worried about the attacks whether it's

1043
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,240
murder attack vulnerability scan

1044
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,020
findings pen test findings

1045
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,760
start looking for things on the

1046
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,220
horizontal

1047
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,960
you will see that there are certain

1048
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,940
attacks

1049
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,859
where they're kill shots you know

1050
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,660
there's only one

1051
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,339
or none

1052
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:25,319
those are the things that you need to be

1053
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:27,060
careful of

1054
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,339
and what you will find unfortunately

1055
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,140
when you first do this and this is a bit

1056
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,240
of a warning when you first do this type

1057
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,920
of analysis you are going to see that

1058
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,700
you have an awful lot of these

1059
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,819
because we talk a lot about Security in

1060
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,200
depth

1061
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,880
but we don't actually really double

1062
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,680
check to make sure that we have security

1063
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,260
and depth

1064
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,000
and

1065
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,680
you know I think that we need to start

1066
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,359
doing something about that as an

1067
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:57,540
industry so start start considering this

1068
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,000
now I don't know if you follow me on

1069
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,599
Twitter I'm at better safetynet but if

1070
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,099
you follow me on Twitter you'll see that

1071
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:06,780
for quite a while now I've been ranting

1072
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,819
about a thing called IMA it's not a

1073
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:11,099
framework it's just a thought pattern

1074
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:13,560
the whole idea behind IMA is that you

1075
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,140
can very quickly and rapidly fix your

1076
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,599
organization's security posture

1077
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:19,920
and

1078
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,020
um over you know the next couple months

1079
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,400
and stuff I'm going to be releasing more

1080
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,980
and more scripts that help with IMA the

1081
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,260
idea is isolate your systems you can't

1082
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,440
attack what you can't reach firewalls

1083
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,040
work great

1084
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,540
Network micro segmentation is awesome

1085
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,540
use it

1086
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:42,000
also side ring it for your firewalls

1087
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,640
make sure you have egress controls

1088
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,619
there's been many times I've been doing

1089
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:49,740
pen tests where I had man I am so proud

1090
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,960
of the attack it is such a honey it

1091
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,900
works so good deploy it and it can't

1092
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,800
phone home

1093
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,420
well that's rough like what do I do

1094
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,460
a whole lot of nothing I go back to the

1095
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,040
drawing board if you stop the malware

1096
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,420
from being able to phone home it's not

1097
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,880
ideal that it landed but if it can't

1098
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,319
activate

1099
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:16,020
I'll take that that's a win it's not a

1100
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,880
perfect like Flawless win but that's a

1101
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,900
good win

1102
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,420
start minimizing

1103
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,940
I don't get why people are I mean I

1104
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,160
understand why we use defaults I

1105
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,200
understand why we use base builds I

1106
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,060
understand why we pull down containers

1107
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,960
from like you know Docker like defaults

1108
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,839
and stuff but minimize please minimize

1109
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:39,300
you can't attack what's not there

1110
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,540
the other thing is uh your cost in New

1111
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,819
York a lot of money if you're if you

1112
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:47,339
have extra craft and also that's a lot

1113
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:49,680
of patching like if it's not there you

1114
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,140
don't even have to patch so minimize use

1115
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,460
those hardening scripts use those

1116
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,200
templates if you're just getting started

1117
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,180
on this journey check out the center for

1118
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,339
Internet Security

1119
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:02,160
um uh benchmarks is what they call them

1120
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,660
the center for Internet Security

1121
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,140
benchmarks uh caution I'm very

1122
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,420
passionate about infosec

1123
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,420
they will cure insomnia okay

1124
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,400
um if in the folks that are chuckling

1125
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,900
they've read the benchmarks they can

1126
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,780
vouch

1127
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:21,540
monitor everything in your network is a

1128
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,460
sensor everything can be bypassed but

1129
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,000
those bypasses are strange one of my

1130
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,500
favorite clients that I hate pen testing

1131
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,960
they have an incredible app Locker

1132
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,000
policy

1133
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,339
and their app Locker policy is pretty

1134
00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:40,140
good now some of you might be but I can

1135
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,680
bypass app Locker yeah you can but you

1136
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,119
know what they do that makes it really

1137
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,380
uncool is they have a an alert when

1138
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,480
somebody issues a command that says hey

1139
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,060
is app Locker running that's an alert

1140
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,099
because Bob in HR doesn't even know what

1141
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:58,079
an app Locker is

1142
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,540
nobody asks that the only time that you

1143
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,099
get a false positive on that is when an

1144
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:04,440
auditor comes through

1145
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,359
and then the other thing and this is a

1146
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:09,780
super high priority alert is hey app

1147
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,020
Locker give me your configuration

1148
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,359
Nobody Does that except attackers or

1149
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,220
auditors

1150
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,960
make that be your alert look for

1151
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,700
enumeration look for those sorts of

1152
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:25,380
things evasion is strange

1153
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,660
don't buy the hype from the vendors they

1154
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,220
say oh they were doing Advanced

1155
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,319
beaconing you couldn't see it yeah you

1156
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:34,560
can it looks bizarre start monitoring

1157
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,240
for that

1158
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,060
start doing active defense

1159
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,880
um shout out to a talk I gave in 2019 at

1160
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,280
Wild West hack infest which oddly was

1161
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,740
the last conference before this one that

1162
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,780
that I participated in

1163
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,940
um it's called Web apps dripping with

1164
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:51,839
honey

1165
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,599
and I give you an hour of here's how you

1166
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:56,400
make life miserable for the attacker

1167
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,200
because attackers have to do certain

1168
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,060
things

1169
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,579
anticipate that you're worried about

1170
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:05,700
financial fraud cool create a table

1171
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,819
called CC underscore info populate it

1172
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:11,040
with fake credit card data and just sit

1173
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,900
back and watch who's accessing that

1174
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,640
table

1175
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,180
nobody will except the attackers and if

1176
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:21,960
I'm a pen tester I have to look at that

1177
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,880
so start putting yourself in the shoes

1178
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,060
of the attackers and you know make honey

1179
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,339
documents make honey Services make honey

1180
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:32,280
functions honey user accounts I don't

1181
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,900
know if you're following sub t on

1182
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,240
Twitter but not too long ago he released

1183
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,920
the thing how many folks do work with

1184
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,599
AWS

1185
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,220
okay

1186
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,500
here's this nightmare scenario tool that

1187
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,440
he made it's a fake

1188
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,079
AWS credential Creator so you get those

1189
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:52,140
AWS keys that are used for AWS CLI or

1190
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,060
any sort of automation tool

1191
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,780
he has a tool that generates over 2 000

1192
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,079
fake AWS certs

1193
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:03,180
now you as the dev and the user you

1194
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,440
don't care because you're using the

1195
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,619
right search you know where they are

1196
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:10,760
as an attacker

1197
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:14,520
Oh no I got to start Dialing for Dollars

1198
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,460
and then all you have to do all you have

1199
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,619
to do is start looking for these

1200
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:22,440
particular honey certs being used or

1201
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,839
attempt to be logged in in your AWS

1202
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:26,280
instance

1203
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,520
if infosec is too hard

1204
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,599
you're doing it wrong

1205
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:35,359
okay

1206
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:38,280
sub t

1207
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,319
s u b t e e

1208
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,359
so I don't know I'm kind of running low

1209
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,940
on time I wanted to get back to

1210
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,220
Pandora's Box

1211
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,040
if you remember the parable of Pandora's

1212
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,020
Box all the evils Spilled Out of the Box

1213
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,640
but

1214
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,920
at the bottom of the box

1215
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,839
oh

1216
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,359
all right

1217
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:08,760
over and over again in this talk I said

1218
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,520
it's not fair and I'd be lying to you if

1219
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,339
I said anything but that it's not fair

1220
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:17,220
your attacker is more better Finance

1221
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,920
than you it just are that was true when

1222
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,640
I worked at the bank

1223
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,619
so if they're out financing us when

1224
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:27,060
we're at the bank

1225
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,280
you're not going to win that fight

1226
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,520
so don't play that game shift it it's

1227
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,319
your house

1228
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,300
start listening to things that are weird

1229
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,780
if some bump in the night happens at oh

1230
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:42,660
Dark Thirty you know you're you're going

1231
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,280
to have that mental checklist of oh well

1232
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,980
I could run and hide or I got these

1233
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,140
weapons available or I can improvise

1234
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,760
this into a weapon

1235
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,280
it's your home

1236
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,680
start figuring out how you can build up

1237
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,540
your environment

1238
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,640
treated as such learn how the attackers

1239
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,319
work

1240
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:03,480
understand that no matter how advanced

1241
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,540
they are they have to do certain things

1242
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,339
you know they have to get that data they

1243
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:11,640
have to start finding that data look for

1244
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,420
those attacker patterns Bob in HR is not

1245
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,059
going to the r d server

1246
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:20,339
I mean Bob's computer might be but it

1247
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:23,400
ain't Bob right Bob's just a puppet that

1248
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,040
somebody's controlling at that point

1249
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,300
so

1250
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,280
I want you to walk away with this with

1251
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,859
hope you can fight

1252
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:33,720
and you can win you're not going to win

1253
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,099
every battle

1254
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:39,480
but you can win this war and we have to

1255
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,640
because going back a bunch of slides I

1256
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,319
don't want

1257
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:46,260
Kim Jong-un Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin

1258
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:49,800
deciding what our future will be

1259
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,400
and yeah that again that's a heavy heavy

1260
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,960
thing

1261
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,660
and there's plenty of days where I get

1262
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,880
crushed under that thought and

1263
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,220
cards completely face up

1264
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,200
before I came to this conference my wife

1265
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,300
and I went camping in New River Gorge to

1266
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,280
just

1267
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,160
let me excise that demons because I got

1268
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,920
off into an engagement where we got our

1269
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,859
teeth kicked in and curb stomped you're

1270
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:19,440
not going to win all the ones

1271
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,819
but

1272
00:52:20,819 --> 00:52:22,980
there's a really cool Japanese saying

1273
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,200
and I don't speak Japanese but I love

1274
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,400
this saying

1275
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,619
fall seven times

1276
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:31,339
stand eight

1277
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,040
you folks have given me hope you're here

1278

1280
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,579
participation stuff you could have just

1281
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:43,800
