00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,740
years I don't know how many of y'all

I update the stories update the

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,860
scenarios uh because we're always always

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,140
making new mistakes and what have you

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,360
but uh we'll get into that as we go

17

through here this is a it's going to be

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,539
a presentation on making mistakes and um

19
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,399
we'll talk about that a bit more here so

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,719
first off the uh obligatory who am I I'm

21
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,719
my name is Adam Compton I currently work

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,579
for trusted SEC

23
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,280
um Dave Kennedy's company up there

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,840
um a principal security consultant for

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,400
them I've been there for a little over

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,280
four years now I've been around the

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,420
industry

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,460
uh I.T in general since around

29
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,460
94.95 pin testing security all that

30
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,580
directly since about 2000 so I've been

31
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,140
around for a while and in that time I've

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,220
done development research pen testing

33
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,280
pretty much any type of it in there I've

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,619
dabbled in a little bit of ir not much

35
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,840
it's a tiny little bit of that been on

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,460
the defensive side I've done a little

37
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,100
bit of all of it over the years but

38
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,479
predominantly most of the time has been

39
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,060
doing pin testing of some form that

40
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,900
involves internal external web app some

41
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,460
social engineering whether that's

42
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,119
breaking into buildings or fishing voice

43
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,520
whatever the case is that's where most

44
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,920
of my experience Falls and through that

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,259
and over my 20 plus years of doing this

46
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,619
and with my co-workers doing this we

47
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,180
have come across a number of scenarios

48
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,880
where we have been making mistakes

49
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,200
and that is why I wanted to do this talk

50
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,840
um too many times

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,180
I go to conferences

52
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,180
um I see it on newsgroups I see it on

53
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,180
videos I see it all over on social media

54
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,580
people talking about I developed this

55
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,099
great new tool or I just discovered this

56
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,200
new hack or I did this awesome thing

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,480
look and watch how awesome I am and how

58
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,940
great this thing is that's great I

59
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,040
applaud you for that great for all the

60
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,660
hard work you put into that

61
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,220
but you're not showing all the hard work

62
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,900
that went into that you're not showing

63
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,819
most times you're not most times you're

64
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,440
not showing all the failures you had

65
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,400
developing that and that's where I I get

66
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,500
this sense from talking with a bunch of

67
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,360
Junior individuals people getting into

68
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,459
the industry people

69
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,560
um just at conferences and whatnot they

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,060
come up and they're like okay I feel a

71
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,680
little frustrated I know I've done this

72
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,959
myself I see all these great hacks out

73
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,940
there and I'm not doing those great

74
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,300
hacks or I feel like I'm failing a lot

75
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,280
of the times I'm not getting these great

76
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,280
opportunities or whatever or I try to

77
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,500
set up my lab and I can't get this set

78
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,239
up or I can't do something like that I

79
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,760
feel it's sort of that imposter syndrome

80
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,400
scenario out there but because of that I

81
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,780
want to say well

82
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,780
stop think I know I make mistakes I know

83
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,400
my colleagues make mistakes so I sit

84
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,080
around went through my own history

85
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,700
talked with my colleagues and all that

86
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,959
and like

87
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,879
how about we start telling our stories

88
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,040
none of our great successes but at the

89
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,680
times that we just really stepped in it

90
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,920
out there things that just went wrong

91
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,239
I'm not saying that the customer did

92
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,459
something wrong something that we did

93
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,519
wrong uh we well you'll hear in some of

94
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:51,900
the stories here some of the scenarios

95
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,299
here keep in mind toward the end of this

96
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,980
depending on how much time we have left

97
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,959
I might ask

98
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,200
the congregation here as to uh if you

99
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,060
have any stories of your own that you'd

100
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,260
like to share

101
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,000
just keep that in mind let that

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,799
percolate in there let me go ahead and

103
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,720
get through through going on with this

104
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,159
so

105
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,439
um one thing you will notice is my

106
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,540
slides have no details on them it's just

107
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,160
quotes about learning from mistakes

108
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,320
that's it

109
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,940

You Through This uh presentation but so

114
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,580
let's go ahead and get started here

115
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,900
after I get a drink so

116
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,880
the first set of stories I have for you

117
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,680
here are coming back from when everybody

118
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,300
started doing the work from home

119
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,300
scenario I've been working from home for

120
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,699
a number of years already but

121
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,979
it became much more common much more

122
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,020
popular for us to be working from home

123
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,639
and all that for over the past few years

124
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,919
here and one of the scenarios that comes

125
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,139
up is a lot more meetings over that I

126
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,639
don't know there's been memes about this

127
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,180
and all this but it's actually happened

128
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,639
um I was doing a presentation

129
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,979
and um

130
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:10,620
uh what was it oh yeah I was doing a

131
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,160
presentation and we took a moment to

132
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,919
step away go vial break whatever I got

133
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,400
up left my desk and I come back and I

134
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,199
was in the process of changing my shirt

135
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,759
because I'd spilled something on it or

136
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,259
something I'm like oh it's hot I forget

137
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,180
what the scenario was I come back and

138
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,620
I'm sitting down putting my shirt back

139
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,400
on

140
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,900
and that's when one of my co-workers

141
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,500
goes hey Adam I like your shirt I'm like

142

143
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,940
I thought I'd closed that video when I

144
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,660

145
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,919

152
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,039

I mean those are not damaging those are

156
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,539
just things that you part of the

157
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,840
industry that you're dealing with but um

158

some other ones that do come up is

159
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,220
during a presentation if you're in a

160
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,419

00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,840
that or just have a

168
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,840
come into yourself out loud and

169
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,940
it's not very flattering to the people

170
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,000
giving the presentation that's never a

171
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,180
good deal so just be aware of what have

172
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,280
you but more importantly the one that

173
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,319
hit me the hardest at one time was

174
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,780
sharing the wrong screen

175
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,220
you're going to give the presentation

176
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,039
you hit share screen and either I'm

177
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,020
sharing now a

178
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,479
sensitive uh email that I have up on the

179
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,880
screen or an internal chat program which

180
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,600
probably isn't um customer safe facing

181
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,639
uh stuff like that or things of that

182
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,160
nature along with that is disabling

183
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,960
notifications because

184
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,880
I don't know how many people in here

185
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,800
work with co-workers that are practical

186
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,280
jokers or not but we have a few luckily

187
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,699
this didn't happen while presenting to a

188
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,680
customer is presenting to the company as

189
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,900
a whole but sitting there doing a

190
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,120
presentation and I get an email in it

191
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,240
pops up on my screen like hey you have

192
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,340
an email but I'm sharing my screen at

193
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,360
the time

194
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,160
then my co-workers noticed that I have

195
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,919
notifications not disabled so they start

196
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,840
sending me lots of notifications asking

197
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,460
me some very um

198
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,280
again probably not safe for work

199
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,300
um

200
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,979
questions showing up on there so I have

201
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,860
to pause video go disable comments and

202
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,599
then in separate chats like make sure

203
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,039
you always disable comment I mean

204
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,099
disable notifications Adam I'm like

205
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:59,460
listen learned lesson learned so yeah

206
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,979
none of this was really too bad for a

207
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,199
customer this is all just faux pas

208
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,840
whatever you want to say about that

209
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,599
but we're going to move into some actual

210
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,599
customer facing ones here

211
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,880
part of the job is writing a report if

212
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,380
you're a consultant you're writing lots

213
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,580
of reports for lots of different

214
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,259
customers if you're in-house security

215
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,240
you're in-house I.T whatever the case is

216
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,919
you're writing it for your boss you're

217
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,780
writing it for your department what have

218
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,740
you

219
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,660
this comes into a big play if you're

220
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,400
like me and I'm a consultant I'm writing

221
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,780
a report for customers different

222
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,520
customers all the time

223
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,979
well as I'm writing a report probably

224
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,559
once a week they're about

225
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,479
um I get tired of writing the same

226
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,659
things over and over it's very tempting

227
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,399
to hit that copy and paste the copy

228
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,320
sections from old reports

229
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,899
not a horrible scenario if you're

230
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,640
copying from the previous report for

231
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,339
that customer into the current one

232
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,080
it's pretty bad if you're coming from

233
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,760
another customer's report into this one

234
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,040
and you forget to sanitize it such as

235
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,959
you leave it an odd screenshot in there

236
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,800
or the other customer's name in there

237
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,860
um ideally you have a QA process in your

238
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,360
company before reports go down it gets

239
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,240
caught in that and um but

240
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,220
I've been reviewing reports and I have

241
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,320
to admit at some point in my time I have

242
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,420
been guilty of copying over the wrong

243
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,080
screenshots copying over customer names

244
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,940
or template data stuff like that leaving

245
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,040
it in the reporting and getting flagged

246
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,100
through some process of the QA I've

247
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,019
actually looked at Old reports not

248
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,459
necessarily for my current company but

249
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:33,839
for other companies that I've worked for

250
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,820
looked at Old reports that have went out

251
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,640
to the customer and there'll be issues

252
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,080
like that in there that's actually went

253
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,580
customer facing

254
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,580
and um yeah that's just something that

255
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,860
is just bad always

256
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,740
if possible never copy and paste is all

257
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,600
I can say do it from scratch do it from

258
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,700
template do it from something but

259
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,940
but it won the funnier side of that

260
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,820
if you're on site doing an engagement uh

261
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,860
internal pin test let's say or whatever

262
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,600
the scenario is and you have your device

263
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,860
hooked up to the network and you're

264
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,300
attacking from that

265
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,640
you have an IP on their Network

266
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,620
as you're going through your scans you

267
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,779
might scan other systems on your local

268
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,360
subnet you might find issues you might

269
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,100
not include those in the report

270
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,380
you might forget to take your IP out of

271
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,740
that list

272
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,200
you might actually find lots of issues

273
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,360
on that particular system that is your

274
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,920
system

275
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,839
during the out brief you may take tell

276
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,519
your customer that

277
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,260
this isn't the formal out brief it's an

278
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,300
informal like um of all the systems I

279
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,279
found in here the most critical one that

280
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,959
I find the most issues are this

281
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:40,980
particular one right here they're like

282
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,279
isn't that your system I'm like

283
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,140
I don't know I don't remember what my IP

284
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,200
was I'm sorry let me check into that

285
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,779
but yeah um

286
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,120
that has actually come back to in one

287
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,459
form or another I've seen that on a

288
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,380
number of my own reports and other

289
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,880
reports I've reviewed over the years and

290
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,800
I'm very conscious of that at this point

291
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,959
so whenever I get the report finished or

292
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,279
you send it off to peer review or

293
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,519
whatever I search I search for my IP in

294
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,860
there anywhere it's found and make sure

295
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,180
it's not in there anymore because

296
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,279
occasionally it will slip back in there

297
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,920
where I'll just copy it the affected

298
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,480
host list over or something like that

299
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,640
and

300
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,040
I just gotta watch out for that

301
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,839
um

302
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,500
all right

303
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,880
I'll come back to that one maybe uh

304
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,680
let's see what do we have here

305
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,399
all right

306
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,800
part of when I started an engagement

307
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,180
part of when a lot of people start

308
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,740
engagements you ask them what are the

309
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,660
targets you want me to go after or you

310
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,980
want to ask just to do an enumeration

311
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,480
and find what we can or do you want to

312
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,459
give us a list and if they give us a

313
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:48,959
list or what have you one of the

314
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,640
follow-up questions should generally

315
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,579
always be do you have any exclusions are

316
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,320
there any systems that you do not want

317
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,560
us to scan and if so why but for in

318
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,360
particular if you haven't happen to have

319
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,300
a system that you can run an nmap scan

320
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,399
up and it crashes let me know this

321
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,860
before I start scanning

322
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,579
um

323
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:11,100
and if they give you that list make sure

324
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,000
you don't scan that system

325
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:15,899
um I well

326
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,140
this was both my part and their part I

327
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,660
was doing a scan internal Network asked

328
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,160
them if they had any systems they said

329
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,839
no

330
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,260
okay not a problem I run in map

331
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,620
I take down this is a

332
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,500
Nationwide company they have a main

333
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,720
processing like Central us and or

334
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,060
Central like Indiana something like that

335
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,860
they had like Manufacturing in like East

336
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,920
Coast West Coast and what have you

337
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,600
an nmap scan took down their

338
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,339
communication so all their manufacturing

339
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,620
came to a halt

340
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,540
for like two hours

341
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,720
I got yelled at significantly for that

342
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,820
by the customer like how dare you take

343
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,320
this down you're costing us lots of

344
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,540
money I'm like what what did I take down

345
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,519
they tell me and at that point the

346
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,899
assistant men's that were sitting in the

347
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,160
same area as me they're like oh yeah

348
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,420
that's that issue we told you about

349
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,680
before

350
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,240
I'm looking at them I'm like you didn't

351
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,680
tell me that you thought no no we told

352
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,060
our boss that

353
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,279
I'm like and when I asked you if there's

354
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,720
any systems I shouldn't scan why didn't

355
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,399
you tell me this one oh we wanted to

356
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,200
demonstrate it to them foreign

357
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,380
demonstrating I'm fine being the

358
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,959
sledgehammer let me in on it though

359
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:31,139
don't Blindside me with this

360
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,720
um but yeah there's also the other times

361
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,279
where

362
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,579
you don't verify the lists

363
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,380
external scans

364
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,720
customer gives you an IP list to scan or

365
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,579
IP ranges to scan for their external

366
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,139
prisons presence

367
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:49,440
that sounds fine okay looks

368
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,420
like valid IPS let me go ahead and hit

369
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,680
that scan

370
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,740
I find some issues I find web cameras oh

371
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,880
great

372
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,320
let me see if I can get into those web

373
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,639
cameras Oh I can get into those web

374
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,500
cameras what am I looking at I'm looking

375
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,240
at other cafeteria

376
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,920
looking at gymnasium yeah

377
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,680
this isn't a law firm is it

378
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,819
this is a school

379
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,560
why am i pen testing a school this isn't

380
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,560
XYZ legal firm so I go back and look at

381
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,680
it

382
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,660
IPS don't map to them anymore I asked

383
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,860
the customer about this and they're like

384
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,120
oh yeah

385
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,660
um

386
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,240
we used to have that IP range or we had

387
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,040
the IP range lease or something but we

388
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,620
gave that up a couple years ago I'm like

389
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,740
this is part of the list you provided me

390
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,720
it's like oh yeah sorry about that I'm

391
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,720
like oh so I've spent the last week more

392
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,420
or less half of it attacking a school

393
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,480
and not the actual customer

394
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,519
um that is on me

395
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,100
whenever I got from the unknown I get an

396
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,199
external IP range I do who is on it I

397
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,660
look it up when I am I'll do DNS lookups

398
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,860
I go through everything I can to

399
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,620
validate that that looks like it is the

400
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,300
proper customer then I go back to them

401
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,880
if it doesn't match I'm like hey is this

402
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,279
really you they're like yeah we told you

403
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,440
it wasn't like just covering my backside

404
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,600
I fed issues in this scenario in the

405
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,839
past just double checking

406
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,800
all right

407
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,779
those of you who do internal pen tests

408
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,180
do scans do whatever have you ever

409
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,000
lucked out accounts

410
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,160
no never okay no

411
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,079
previous life I used to do a lot of work

412
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,180
for the government

413
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,639
how is that uh

414
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,560
large Data Center

415
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,920
lots of HP systems in there lots of like

416
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,920
big powerful HP systems in there let's

417
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,260
do an internal scans on them

418
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,060
I wanted to do some password guessing

419
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,040
I'm like okay well what counselor is

420
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,720
safe for do password guessing well it's

421
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,760
a Unix system root should be fine to do

422
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,800
password guessing yes

423
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,899
I looked out rude on like a hundred and

424
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:04,920
some HP systems in there lock them out

425
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,560
they had it set that HP or that root

426
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,779
could get locked out that'll but they're

427
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:11,940
like oh well we can fix it we have to

428
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,500
log in at the console

429
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,500
on every single one

430
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,899
across this entire campus I'm like oh

431
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,459
sorry

432
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:23,339
but I have to admit I never expected

433
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,740
root to get locked out I never came

434
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,240
across that before but that's fine

435
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,600
that's fine I have locked out other

436
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,000
accounts before because I didn't ask the

437
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,060
customer what is your observation window

438
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,000
I assume like an hour two hours

439
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,100
something like that on like active

440
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,600
directory passwords or something like

441
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,259
that

442
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:44,820
but they did say like three failed and

443
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,740
it's locked out I'm like okay so I

444
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,720
kicked it off like one every hour and a

445
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,660
half one every two hours

446
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,660
about six hours in I get Franklin call

447
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,980
from the customer that all their

448
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,360
accounts are locked out

449
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,100
could have had it throttled enough well

450
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,600
what's your login policy and they tell

451
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,799
me you know what's your observation

452
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,819
window

453
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,220
oh we don't have one

454
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,079
it's like 65 years or something

455
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,699
ridiculous like that whatever it works

456
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,099
out to you I'm like

457
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,679
okay sorry about that

458
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,599
um this particular scenario was

459
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,240
particularly interesting because I

460
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,839
lucked up all the domain admins

461
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,099
and all the users

462
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,559
they had a special account that wasn't

463
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,440
in AD or something like that that they

464
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,780
had to have like good and safe get its

465
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,100
password out it's like their fail say

466
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,039
get in there then they can re-enable one

467
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,480
of the domain admins and then they could

468
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,360
reset everything but yeah it was a good

469
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,000
um test of their disaster recovery at

470
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,039
least but

471
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,919
but yeah so observation Windows very

472
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,780
important

473
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,400
just double checking what the customer

474
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,320
has to whether or not all accounts can

475
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,440
be locked out good one there too

476
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,140
and if you're scanning uh I don't see

477
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,120
this one often anymore it used to be

478
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,980
much more common in the past when web

479
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,080
app issues were very common like SQL

480
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,760
injection all that they're still out

481
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,919
there just not quite as common as they

482
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,160
were 10 15 years ago but doing a web app

483
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,480
scan come across a form and it's uh like

484
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,179
a forgot your password form well I was

485
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,559
just going to go in then I was going to

486
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,000
let it run and see if I could uh

487
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,460
enumerate users

488
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,799
well it wasn't just enumerating users

489
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,140
because when you forgot your password it

490
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,059
changed the password when you submit the

491
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,919
form

492
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,020
so I changed everybody's password for

493
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,020
the company through the web app form

494
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,940
they all got their emails telling them

495
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,740
their new password had changed and what

496
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,600
it was but

497
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,940
definitely I don't think they the entire

498
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,679
company was expecting that like at 11

499
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,280
A.M on a Monday so yeah got a nice call

500
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,900

password I'm like yeah well no I didn't

503
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:03,299
mean to but uh I guess I did so worked

504
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:04,860
through that one customer wasn't upset

505
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,660
they still had access or what have you

506
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,200
but that was just a side effect of doing

507
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,120
um password reset

508
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,480

510
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,299

I may have told a version of this in the

514
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,980
past or one of these in the past but

515
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,820
so I had a customer it was a small Bank

516
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,280
a small um I don't know if it was a bank

517
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,160
or if it was like a

518
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,919
it was something money related I forget

519
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,200
what it was it's a number of years ago

520
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,120
and it was in a shared building like you

521

522
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,780
offices around and it was like one of

523
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,340
them or there's a little Credit Union or

524
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,179

531
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,780
figure out what I want to do all right

532
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,520
I see somebody walking that way I'm like

533
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,200
okay I grab my boxes I start walking

534
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,460
behind them

535
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,220
walking walking walking they open the

536
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,620
door they let me through I walk in there

537
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,720
I walk down a little ways and I start

538
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,500
looking around

539
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,860
I see diagrams I see models I see

540
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,199
construction plan I'm not in a bank

541
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,840
I look around I'm like I think I walked

542
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,460
in the wrong door I'm sorry and I back

543
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,860
out there I walked in the door just to

544
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,660
the left of the one I wanted to

545
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,160
because I wasn't paying attention I had

546
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,440
my eyes down carrying the Box

547
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,720
well okay so fine I went on did the

548
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,880
engagement following that the following

549
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,320
year my co-worker had the same

550
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,000
engagement they wanted to see if he

551
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,039
could do physical engagement as well I

552
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,900
got a call from him later that day or

553
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,820
later on that Monday or whatever so

554
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,380
guess what happened

555
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,440
he did the exact same thing

556
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,940
carrying boxes walked into the

557
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,799
engineering firm right beside of it I'm

558
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,720
like I don't know how that happens but

559
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,919
that is just hilarious but

560
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,480
now there was a different scenario where

561
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,340
I broke into the wrong building

562
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,280
this was in New York this is one that I

563
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,440
know I've told before but I'll go ahead

564
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,940
and share

565
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,220
we get a contract with a customer do

566
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,020
physical assessment break into them

567
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,280
they're supposed to be on like the 13th

568
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,840
floor of some high-rise there in

569
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,039
Manhattan

570
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,840
so I get up there I scope out the

571
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,340
building there's a big old mean looking

572
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,020
guard in the front there always watching

573
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,799
me I'm walking around the other side

574
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,480
he's over there watching me trying to

575
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,039
get away from him finally I catch your

576
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,380
time he's not really there so me and one

577
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,000
of my co-workers we've scoped it out

578
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,919
we've got it all planned we walk up

579
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,960
there we get by the turn Styles there's

580
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,820
like a boy

581
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,600
um

582
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,659
handicap access over here so we can go

583
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,240
sneak around we bypass it all we get to

584
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,679
the elevator

585
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,900
go up the elevator we're lucky that

586
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,419
somebody has pushed the 13th floor all

587
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:04,919
right we're good we're good we get off

588
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,600
there and we follow them off and we go

589
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,640
into the building into that the office

590
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,200
space and we're in there and we're

591
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,179
charting something I'll always find uh

592
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:14,400
passwords on Post-it nodes and we're

593
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,860
seeing sensitive information left out

594
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,919
and we have

595
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,559
hey John come here

596
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,700
we'll get that letterhead

597
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,799
look at the big sign on the wall

598
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,960
that's not our customer is it

599
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,179
crap

600
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:36,659
so we walk our way back out of there we

601
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,580
go off the elevator down to the first

602
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,020
floor where they usually have that big

603
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,600
plaque of what's on what our customer is

604
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,120
not listed there

605
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,799
make a way out of the building we sat

606
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,480
down outside we call up our project

607
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,159
manager ask them about it they're like

608
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,559
no that's the right address

609
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,380
that's nice but they're not here

610
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,780
they we go break for the night they call

611
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,880
the customer come back

612
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,640
apparently the between the time we scope

613
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,320
the engagement they sign the engagement

614
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,120
and we perform the engagement had been

615
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,860
like six months because they had moved

616
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,399
in that time

617
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,559
nowhere was that reflected in the

618
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,360
engagement document

619
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,820
but so we left that building went over

620
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,320
to the real building repeated the

621
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,240
process and got in all that

622
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,039
we gave all this information about the

623
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,780
first location to our project manager I

624
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,220
don't know if he ever contacted them and

625
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,780
told them we gave them a free pen test

626
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,580
or not or a physical assessment or not

627
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,820
but yeah it was uh yeah

628
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,120
We snuck by guard past uh the turnstiles

629
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,620
up the elevator that you had to have the

630
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,539
badge the badge in got into the floor we

631
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,659
did all of that to the wrong customer

632
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:44,400
I'm actually impressed that we got

633
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,840
through it but for some random customer

634
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,340
but

635
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,299
it was just a fun one

636
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,159
oh

637
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,679
have any of y'all are any of y'all old

638
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,659
enough been around long enough to

639
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:03,299
remember when in map or in particular

640
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:04,980
nessus

641
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,960
did not have a good relationship with

642
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,440
printers

643
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:15,539
I was doing an engagement for a

644
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,340
do an engagement for a company that had

645
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,960
bought a bunch of subsidiaries and they

646
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,220
want to just go out and do testing for

647
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,460
them one of them was a some sort of um

648
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,720
a shipping facility down in California

649
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,860
and they

650
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,299
had these big

651
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:30,960
um

652
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,640
it was like for boat parts or something

653
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,140
like that and they did the wrapping for

654
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,400
them and they had these big giant

655
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,620
plotters that they printed out labels on

656
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,480
they stuck to it

657
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,940
as running in math or nessus I was in

658
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,440
there for like eight hours max six hours

659
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,820
something like that that's all I had to

660
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,159
run at this customer and or this

661
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:48,659
location so I'm in there doing my scan

662
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:50,159
I'm almost done anyway and I'm kicked

663
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,539
off nesses just to see if it found

664
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,159
anything extra that I hadn't found by

665
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,799
hand it's running

666
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,780
about five ten minutes into it I hear

667
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,299
screaming coming up from down in the

668
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,280
work floor

669
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,340
what's that I'll go stick my head out to

670
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,600
point in contact I'm like what's going

671
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,580
on he goes oh I don't know uh don't

672
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,840
worry about it it's something is going

673
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,940
on with our plotters down there like

674
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,260
well okay foreign

675
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,320
while you're working on that I think I'm

676
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,820
about done right here I'm gonna go ahead

677
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,380
and pack up I'm gonna make it over to

678
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,580
the airport I need to fly off to the

679
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,559
next location okay not a problem on my

680
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,179
way out there was a

681
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,159
it looked just like the normal printer

682
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:30,960
just spewing out the old like ribbon

683
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,760
paper but it was like plotters just

684
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,740
piling up I don't know how expensive

685
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,580
that paper where it was oh my God

686
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,179
[Music]

687
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:40,860
it's all good do you think it's anything

688
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,779
no no that's not related to you I'm like

689
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:44,760
I'm good

690
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,340
thank you uh this was a number of years

691
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,140
ago but yeah um

692
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,539
similar scenario running in map in a

693
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,600
like a financial institution

694
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,120
another little like a banknote checks

695
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,860
that they have there those are not cheap

696
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,600
by the way

697
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,340
especially when you start printing

698
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,900
garbage on them they start spewing out

699
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,720
too yeah they're not happy about that

700
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,640
that one wasn't me by the way that was a

701
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,120
co-worker not a trusted sex but it was a

702
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,520
co-worker of mine I still think my giant

703
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,980
plotter one was a better one though yeah

704
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,080
to get more paper

705
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,799
but yeah

706
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,080
that's true that's true I grant you that

707
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,840
so it might be about equal I don't know

708
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,419
but

709
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:32,820
so yeah

710
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,860
it was a fun one this isn't actually a

711
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,380
fail it's sort of a fail but not quite a

712
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,779
fail I was doing work for an

713
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:41,940
international government entity over in

714
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,279
Europe and I was tasked with doing

715
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,620
physical assessment over there

716
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,120
um part of that was to see if I could

717
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,940
sneak into certain areas another one was

718
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,460
to see if I could do like

719
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,100
um data or a drive drop at the time back

720
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,539
when everybody was dropping thumb drives

721
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:58,860
and people were getting them up and all

722
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,740
that not quite a thing anymore but back

723
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,960
then it was so let's go through this

724
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,520
facility dropping thumb drives

725
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,919
everywhere laying them like it copiers

726
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,779
laying them at water fountains dropped

727
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:11,820
one right outside of the sock

728
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,000
or the knock actually no the sock I

729
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,340
think it was right outside the sock and

730
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,500
this was on like a Friday

731
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,600
we had it so we could detect when things

732
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,400
were calling back in and all that we got

733
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,500
a few hits on that Friday

734
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,080
on Monday over the weekend we got a lot

735
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,460
of hits

736
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,840
because apparently people were taking

737
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,840
these home and plugging them in and then

738
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,400
some of them were returning them and

739
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,840
trying to put them back because we all

740
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,100
knew where they were and they were

741
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,840
labeled they were putting them back in

742
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,299
the places they found them at like nope

743
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,159
I didn't do that but the one that got me

744
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,140
the most was

745
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,020
um and thank you to our project manager

746
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,700
on site point of contact on site that

747
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,460
saved us on this one but the sock found

748
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,299
it took it inside plugged it in

749
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:00,000
we got a hit from it we recognized IP we

750
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,220
knew what the Sox IP was well right we

751
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,100
got a hook on that we got a and another

752
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,500
like every like minute we got another

753
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,659
one from a different IP within the Sun

754
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:11,159
they had plugged it in couldn't figure

755
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:12,720
out what was going on hey John I can't

756
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,380
get distorted how about you no not me

757
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,940
they went through every system in there

758
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,380
it seemed like

759
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,179
when finally they'll realize oh this

760
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:23,700
might be something malicious

761
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,919
they started tracking the data on it

762
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,600
they saw that was going somewhere within

763
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,919
the facility they figured out what

764
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:31,380
network Port it went to and they had

765
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,360
mapped down they were coming up us they

766
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,500
had like Gardens with them and

767
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,880
everything coming after us our point of

768
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,260
contact jumped in the way he stopped

769
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,940
them tried to explain it

770
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,640
we were not in a good relations with the

771
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,820
sock after that but um not my fault they

772
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,799
chose to use it on every system they had

773
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,700
but

774
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,299
but uh yeah that's just a lesson that be

775
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,340
kind to your point of contact get them

776
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,039
on your side and the people who need to

777
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,740
know what's going on like security maybe

778
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,720
they need to know what's going on so you

779
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,240
don't get arrested but

780
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,000
uh let me see what is that no

781
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,039
um along with that we've had scenarios

782
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:11,900
of um people breaking into Banks

783
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,700
where they get in they do their thing

784
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,200
social engineering they get behind the

785
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,720
counter they get under the counter they

786
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,580
get into offices they didn't get into

787
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,200
the Vault but they're in there this

788
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,580
whole time the bank manager is asking

789
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,059
them like uh what's going on um who are

790
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,620

with it right here and hand them a piece

792
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:32,100
of paper and all that

793
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,020
they never he never gets caught to the

794
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,360
point where he has to ask for um I give

795
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,919
him the get out drop free card sort of

796

thing but he's like he knows that

797
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,760
suspicion level is like maxed out at

798
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,559
this point so he's like well I think I'm

799

other locations to go to

813

814
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,320

almost and every once in a while you

828
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,260
would see he's under a desk in

829
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,580
somebody's office there in the credit

830
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,440
union you'd see something disappear off

831
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,640
the desk

832
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,440
he snuck in God underneath the desk and

833
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,640
he's just reached up and grabbing stuff

834
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,000
off the desk and seeing what it was

835
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,279
and people start looking at him then

836
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,480
noticing what's going on and we're

837
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,159
noticing them and we're not saying a

838
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,299
word

839
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:05,039
he's in there

840
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,360
um he's just doing his thing and then

841
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,500
later he's like

842
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,240
he gets up and he sneaks back into

843
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,620
another room like the printer room or

844
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,659
whatever okay I wonder if he's gonna get

845
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:14,940
in there we get a text message from him

846
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,760
saying get the car ready I'm coming out

847
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,700
okay we pull around the side where we

848
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,860
think he's coming he's pushing the

849
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,620
recycle bin out or like the shred paper

850
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,580
bin he's pushing that out the door

851
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,559
and right behind him is the bank manager

852
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:34,158
walking behind him

853
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:38,640
yeah so he got busted so

854
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,500
and we got get our jail free card and

855
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,419
all that but yeah it's

856
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,279
some people's mind what goes through

857
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,659
them sometimes I'm not sure there

858
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,460

859
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,620
like that those over the years

860
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,179

861
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,179

physical pen test me and a co-worker we

886
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,179
get into a building doesn't matter how

887
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:55,620
we get into the building but we get into

888
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,940
the building

889
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,580
and we're making our way through and I

890
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,460
forget how we actually got in actually I

891
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,620
think we in the smoker's entrance or

892
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,360
what have you but we got in and we're

893
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,980
going through all the way to the other

894
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,020
side of the building we find the comms

895
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,120
closet oh great we go into the commons

896
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,559
closet we're like making home base here

897
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,659
we plug in our little Network tab we

898
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:17,159
have all our stuff we set a bag down

899
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:19,799
we're good but on the right way there we

900
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,539
passed the L I mean the staircase and

901
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:23,159
there was like a little Smoker's door

902
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,200
there right there okay

903
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,760
let's go see if we can get in that way

904
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,679
okay so we leave our stuff there and we

905
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:31,200
get up and we walk over and I walk out

906
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,260
the door and John walks out the door we

907
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,039
hear a click

908
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,220
why did you come outside we don't need

909
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,919
fine let's open the door and get okay

910
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,899
doors locked okay

911
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:49,340
we left over gear inside

912
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,559
neither one of us held the door both of

913
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,360
us went outside the door locked and we

914
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,919
didn't have any of our gear

915
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,100
I had to find another way in so this is

916
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,140
part of a whole other set of stories I

917
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,179
have of always leave yourself a back way

918
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:05,940
and a secondary way in in case you screw

919
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,179
up the first way in which happens more

920
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,699
than I'd like to say but um but yeah on

921
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:12,719
that one we had to actually found

922
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,918
another way in that one I think the

923
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,139
second way we got in was they had some

924
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,820
sort of Credit Union Bank associated

925
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,619
with them and it was a joined to the

926
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:21,239
same building and we just walked in and

927
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,379
the little guy at the front there was

928
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:24,119
like hey can I help you no no we're good

929
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,560
just walk right by him open the door

930
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,780
walk onto the building just keep going

931
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,359
and no one stopped us we're like why

932
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,339
didn't we do that the first time I don't

933
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:35,339
know but so we got in but yeah

934
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,560
so yeah we finally make our way back

935
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,839
around we get to where

936
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,940
backpack and we always carry some of it

937
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,339
with us at that point and

938
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:47,099
that same that same engagement we found

939
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:48,780
like what we thought was going to be

940
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,580
like the system admin or the network

941
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,040

00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,980
scenarios and we do have firewall on our

995
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,320
reporting site that blocks it and also

996
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,480
our payloads also have restrictions to

997
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,880
certain IP space or domain space

998
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,680
something like that now just to account

999
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,839
for a lot of that but

1000
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,079
yeah but ours wasn't a shoe store it was

1001
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:57,960
a tourist discount for like in some

1002
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,119
tourist location for a sightseeing tour

1003
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,160
it was a discount for that so

1004
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,180
thank you

1005
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,380
yeah

1006
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,339
um

1007
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:08,660
Hey sir go ahead

1008
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,540
right

1009
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,619
foreign

1010
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:37,400
oh yeah

1011
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,578
right right

1012
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,359
yeah yeah

1013
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,619
hi

1014
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:10,260
generally I've found that customers or

1015
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,560
clients or whoever aren't overly upset

1016
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,300
about locked accounts long as it's not

1017
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,220
like their domain admin accounts

1018
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,920
generally occasionally you will come

1019
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,420
across that one customer out there that

1020
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,579
is just super annoyed if you lock out

1021
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:24,960
one account

1022
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,880
that's fine it's their prerogative but

1023
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,540
generally that's one that isn't too bad

1024
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,339
um crashing their servers they don't

1025
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:34,020
like taking the domain controller

1026
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,119
offline doesn't it's usually set well

1027
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,760
crashing their core routers and deleting

1028
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,339
their um configs off of them isn't good

1029
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:42,599
either that's a different story about

1030
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,760
understanding your tools

1031
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,579
um I'll go ahead and share that one so

1032
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,440
there's a tool out there it's been out

1033
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,200
for a number of years uh called Cisco oh

1034
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,060
you know smart install exploitation

1035
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,339
toolkit for Cisco

1036
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:58,020
a lot of people seem to be aware of that

1037
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:01,079
one it's a great tool you can query uh

1038
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:03,060
you can download the running config you

1039
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,460
can push and you config to it

1040
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,859
this one particular time there was a

1041
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:10,619
flaw in the detection when it would

1042
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:13,440
check to see if it was vulnerable

1043
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,780
it would then or when you went to

1044
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,280
download the config it would download it

1045
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,960
and delete it

1046
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,200
why I don't know it was a bug I didn't

1047
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,320
know it was a bug I ran that

1048
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,700
down only

1049
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,079
I

1050
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,220
worked on all three of their core

1051
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,020
routers grabbed them I had the running

1052
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,300
configs on my system

1053
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,920
not a problem the system is still

1054
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,339
running just no storm config

1055
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:41,280
that night they had a reboot nothing

1056
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,380
came back

1057
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,300
we had the configs we gave them back to

1058
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,960
them but

1059
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:53,160
yeah it was a bit of a issue but yeah we

1060
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,280
had the open figs they restored them now

1061
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,260
it's good but uh

1062
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,200
yeah that was where a sort of a scenario

1063
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,540
of know your tools know them well and if

1064
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,119
it's something that is a latest version

1065
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,980
of a tool that you're using go to see

1066
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,079
what got fixed and if there's any recent

1067
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,420
issues with that one

1068
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,940
um yeah as a result now I tend to use

1069
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,400
only tools I'm really comforted in or

1070
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
slightly older versions that I know

1071
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,920
exactly how they work so but yeah those

1072
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,820
those there's always issues with that so

1073
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:30,119
well we're about 45 minutes in I'd be

1074
