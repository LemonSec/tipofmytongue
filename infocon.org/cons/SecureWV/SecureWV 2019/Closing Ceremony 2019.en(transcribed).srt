125
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:42,699
the PMD group for a while so they also

126
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:46,000

like I gotta get these things now so

166
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:03,580

00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:47,769
is we've literally had this discussion

229

234
00:14:59,619 --> 00:15:05,679

236
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:14,009

237
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:18,129

yeah yes

327
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:14,590
so the seats have really ruined me

328
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:18,650
totally right

329
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:21,980
so I have to push that on the closing

330
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:25,760
ceremonies we enamels the dates for next

331
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:37,330
year so what was this year what number

332
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:43,910
one so yes so next year it goes to 11

333
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:49,080
so next year will be November 6th 7th

334
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:52,170
and 8th and remember remember

335
00:24:49,080 --> 00:25:11,129
November we will try and have a dinner

336
00:24:52,170 --> 00:25:15,380
Thursday night for yes so we may have to

337
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,380
burn it but we might maybe we have like

338
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:28,950
get the reference to it goes to 11

339
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:32,730
well time yes so yeah you're at least

340
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:34,770
the CTF will have references to spinal

341
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,990
tap I can't guarantee the pork what's

342
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:40,050
the goat just wiped out and after

343
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:42,300
January I don't freaking care they can

344
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:45,899
figure out what they won I do care

345
00:25:42,300 --> 00:26:00,290
because I think of the CGS but the CTF

346
00:25:45,900 --> 00:26:04,790
will be based on ahead told a couple of

347
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:04,790
do it as long as it works

348
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:27,740
