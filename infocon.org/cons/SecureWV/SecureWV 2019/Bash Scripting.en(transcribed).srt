1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,650
knowledge I've worked with people

2
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:18,289
unfortunately that would haven't had a

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:32,058
treasure trove of knowledge but they

4
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:34,339
wouldn't share it with you you know find

5
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:43,059
out whatever it is you know like I'm

6
00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:46,820
learning the first ever you know like

7
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:49,309
like theater work is the guy I was even

8
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:52,730
on was got with with basic questions and

9
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:54,199
he some reason you know I would always

10
00:00:52,730 --> 00:01:11,330
go straight to the source

11
00:00:54,199 --> 00:01:16,549
and I always helps and then sure enough

12
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:18,830
you know there would be a bug fixes so

13
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:35,170
try to give back to the industry even

14
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:35,170
though if you might be new traits

15
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:45,500
repository for that tool and fix that's

16
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,869
even better

17
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:58,539
submit a pull request that way that's

18
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:58,539
helping you interact with the hey

19
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:05,039
XYZ thank you

20
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,810
that helped me have a whole lot I was

21
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,180
having the same problem when I was just

22
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:19,170
scared and I didn't want to do what any

23
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:38,000
questions about that networking so this

24
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:38,000
is a beginning to intermediate all right

25
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:47,120
it's called discovery and basically what

26
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:57,299
discover is a bunch of processes that

27
00:02:47,120 --> 00:03:19,980
basis it helps to automate a repeatable

28
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:23,670
process super quick acts is a very easy

29
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:27,329
language to be able to help automate and

30
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:30,170
string different tools that's just a big

31
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,170
rapper script

32
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:36,650
- liquor when you go into a client the

33
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:43,640
new client on Monday morning you know

34
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:55,340
it's like you're the bank it's like he

35
00:03:43,640 --> 00:04:02,420
wants to over here look at your

36
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:26,930
infrastructure come in from the side

37
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:28,610
door in the meantime so as soon as I get

38
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,370
there hopefully before there I've

39
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:36,550
already got a list of IPs of sylars then

40
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,550
I need a trainer

41
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:14,470
with this it makes you any questions on

42
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:31,340
that

43
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:35,000
okay alright so first thing we'll talk

44
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:46,539
about is just sitting up aliases to make

45
00:05:35,000 --> 00:06:17,270
things and you can see I've got

46
00:05:46,540 --> 00:06:32,470
different things so for example so right

47
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:32,469
here see see the list

48
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:38,029
sorry

49
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:58,590
I can't tell you how many hundred times

50
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,770
of days I use those right there and how

51
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,770
many

52
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:12,050
any questions on that saves a whole lot

53
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:15,599
of keystrokes so you have a mystery here

54
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:18,810
clear I want to get the desktop D you

55
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,300
know list back from nmap how could you

56
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,980
tell what a Linux box is just by the

57
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,880
ports that are open what ports would you

58
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:31,890
look for anyone Bueller for people

59
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:36,360
running SSH or running on what port okay

60
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:39,720
and huh

61
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,030
I certainly hope not okay so SSI is

62
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,280
running on TCP port 22 if you get a box

63
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:47,040
ring like that more than likely and no

64
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:49,500
other ports open more than likely it's a

65
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:55,980
linux box how do I identify a Windows

66
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:59,880
box it's running there you got TCP 145

67
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:03,360
are 445 or 149 so if I go out to

68
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:07,890
engagement and go hey quickly I need to

69
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,320
identify all of the windows boxes on the

70
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:13,730
network so I would use in map I'm

71
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,730
skipping around here a little bit sorry

72
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,559
I can just do the whole room life

73
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,589
do decide

74
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:21,540
better font size okay if the font size

75
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,920
is too small please let me know so if we

76
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,959
go in and there's three people on the

77
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,360
team and I'm managing the team and I'm

78
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,040
working more with the interfacing with

79
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,480
the client I'm gonna be the guy that

80
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,689
comes in and gets a target list from the

81
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,460
client I'm gonna immediately set up the

82
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,200
or break out the work in between

83
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,730
different people by the way that the

84
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,950
application I'm using right here is

85
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,970
terminator if you're on Kali Linux I

86
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,610
highly recommend it

87
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,920
so you can split your screen

88
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:50,990
horizontally or vertically like that to

89
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,990
see different things so

90
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:21,129
okay who can tell me what this line

91
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:21,129
right here means anybody

92
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:28,729
first of all does everybody know what

93
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:31,969
nmap is does anyone not know what nmap

94
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,709
is okay so nmap stands for network

95
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:36,079
mapper it was written by a guy named

96
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:38,449
Theodore and once it what it does is it

97
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:42,439
goes out and sends various packets out

98
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:45,199
on the wire and it checks for it tries

99
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:48,769
to identify ports that are open filtered

100
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:51,469
or closed it tries to tell you what

101
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:53,149
services are running on that port and

102
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,970
they can try to tell you what versions

103
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:58,069
of the service of running it tries to

104
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:00,559
fingerprint the operating system and

105
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:03,589
very important it has this thing called

106
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:07,879
NSE which is in map scripting engine and

107
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:12,319
there are over 500 in map scripts and

108
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:14,809
what these are for is they help to help

109
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:17,479
to further enumerate services that are

110
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:19,910
open so on this particular line right

111
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,910
here when I'm saying is the first switch

112
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:25,009
capital P - in that saying don't ping

113
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,350
the host so your first line of defense

114
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:29,420
as a as a defender is to set your

115
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,819
network card in a position so that it

116
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,349
doesn't respond to things so everyone

117
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:35,209
thinks you're not on the network if

118
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,970
you're on a Mac it's called stealth mode

119
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:39,709
enable stealth mode so don't pick the

120
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,799
host I want to go ahead and assume that

121
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:45,079
that host is online - n means don't

122
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:48,439
resolve DNS if you're doing a very large

123
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:51,349
scan turning this off greatly greatly

124
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:54,829
increases the speed of your scan the

125
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:58,549
next thing - T for the timing of in map

126
00:12:54,829 --> 00:13:00,739
is a variable between 0 and 5 0 being

127
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:03,259
the most slowest which I believe is

128
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:07,699
paranoid and 5 is the fastest which is

129
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:09,709
insane slow or the 0 would be for a low

130
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:11,899
and slow type of engagement you're doing

131
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:13,819
a you're doing a red team type of

132
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:14,600
engagement where you've you've you've

133
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:17,118
got a beachhead

134
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,829
and you want to try to you know do some

135
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:20,929
lateral movement but you want to scan

136
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:22,939
and go completely under the radar so

137
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:25,160
you're only sending a packet out once

138
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:26,900
every several of seconds so you're

139
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,060
trying to keep a very low profile

140
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,610
if you don't set the timing it

141
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:34,880
automatically sets it to t3 which is

142
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:37,520
average I do t4 speeds it up which is

143
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,800
aggressive t5 which is insane

144
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:43,100
it seems to go so fast that it actually

145
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,849
misses some items so I would absolutely

146
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:48,440
suggest not using t5 the next switch for

147
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,210
me is very important I don't want to see

148
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,520
all kinds of crap back from the end map

149
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,500
I just want to see show me only the open

150
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,630
ports that are back I don't see any

151
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,589
ports that are filtered I'm looking for

152
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,410
low-hanging fruit

153
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:02,960
I'm trying to break into a box and

154
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:06,110
lateral move as fast as I can so show me

155
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:08,510
the only open ports right here this is

156
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,970
telling me to scan only port four four

157
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:16,150
five if I'm going after a Windows host I

158
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:20,450
might say 139 and four four five and

159
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:23,779
anyone know what port 3389 is ro desktop

160
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:25,940
exactly which is used for remote

161
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:28,700
administration in Windows networks so

162
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:32,570
most Windows boxes on an internal

163
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:35,120
network will have these ports exposed if

164
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,650
they have these ports exposed on an

165
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,480
external network they're going to be

166
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:44,449
owned - il targets

167
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,420
that's your input list il and it targets

168
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:49,400
just gonna be a file and the file can be

169
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:52,939
made up of different things that can

170
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:58,130
have IP addresses it can have a range

171
00:14:52,940 --> 00:15:04,459
let's say two nonzero 0/20 so that would

172
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:06,830
be arranged it can take a cider or it

173
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:09,109
can just take an IP address and you can

174
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:12,140
mix and match these in the list which is

175
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:15,170
very cool and then there's different

176
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:21,170
ways you can do output - Oh a and in

177
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:23,229
results away stands for outputs all and

178
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:29,150
that's going to give you a format in

179
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:31,550
text script kitty and XML and I believe

180
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:35,209
there's one an in map format I'm sorry

181
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:37,699
grapple format and different tools I

182
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:40,520
always use output a because I find that

183
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:44,150
different tools take XML

184
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:46,100
put instead of just text and a friend of

185
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:48,890
my friend of mine I might go back to the

186
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:52,370
hotel and go hey man I'm on this gig and

187
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:54,710
I found a box running telnet but it also

188
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,060
has something else open and and I can't

189
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,920
figure out you know what's going on I

190
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,989
need to numerate it better and then I go

191
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,630
hey man check Callie there's a new tool

192
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:05,510
that came out it takes output from a map

193
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:09,290
in XML format boom off to the races

194
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:12,790
so now if I want to change like that

195
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:14,900
again that was for the windows box sorry

196
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:19,010
same thing here what's the only thing

197
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:23,199
that's changed right

198
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,200
and it's port 22 so I'm looking for

199
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,770
Linux boxes okay there might do

200
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:41,720
111 okay get rid of these let's see

201
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:47,230
let's say what if what if I want to go

202
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,230
after all the databases and the network

203
00:16:52,470 --> 00:17:05,459
somebody named me a type of database sq

204
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:05,959
out what poor just SQL right on excuse

205
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:12,059
me

206
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:18,740
okay what else how about Postgres what's

207
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:25,230
that okay guess what there you go no

208
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:43,200
five four three five four three two

209
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:48,450
whoops Mongo again what was what okay

210
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:54,020
and Oracle I always forget this anyone

211
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:54,020
Bueller fifteen what

212
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:12,429
some in google that for me excuse me

213
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:16,960
okay exactly okay so that's how I might

214
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:18,280
mod that script to to look for just the

215
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,360
databases and hopefully you'll have a

216
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:29,800
database guru on your team what else

217
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:33,669
might we want to use in map to do the

218
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:39,990
scan for of network when this is easy

219
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:39,990
stuff what's that

220
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:45,969
yeah I'm uh let's before we go into that

221
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:50,100
let's say we want to go after all the

222
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:53,020
internal web admin interfaces

223
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:57,219
what normally does your web admin

224
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:59,710
interface is run on okay eight four four

225
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:04,420
three that's alternative HTTP port

226
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:10,300
what's the main port okay four four

227
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:14,980
three and what's the HTTP okay what's an

228
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:23,580
honor and ultimate a port for HTTP 8080

229
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:23,580
what else okay so

230
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,280
any questions on that

231
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:16,639
okay so how can we automate this so we

232
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:20,580
have four different types of options

233
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:24,269
that we could possibly run or we could

234
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:27,899
run say all of them okay so we want to

235
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:32,119
build an interface that asks the user

236
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:34,709
question says hey what's your input list

237
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:37,678
it's gonna check to see if you put in a

238
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:40,710
list for an error it's going to check to

239
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:44,240
see if you gave it the correct location

240
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:46,169
of the list and then it's going to say

241
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,480
that's going to be your first set of

242
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:49,799
checks then the next thing is is what do

243
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:56,249
you want to scan for do you want to scan

244
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:58,559
for Windows Linux databases or web what

245
00:20:56,249 --> 00:21:02,269
if the person so that's X that's choices

246
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:04,860
1 through 4 what the person puts in an a

247
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:07,049
well the person puts in a 5 what's the

248
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,389
person puts in a 0 you need to be able

249
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:11,009
to check for all that ok now you're

250
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:12,658
running your own script yeah I know

251
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:14,249
you're not gonna make a mistake but

252
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:16,289
you're building the script and you want

253
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:18,749
to share this out with your buddy or

254
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:22,710
your girlfriend or whatever and let them

255
00:21:18,749 --> 00:21:25,590
use it again discover which is a huge

256
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:29,070
project started back in 2007 when I was

257
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:30,899
doing the OS CP and I noticed that I

258
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:34,139
kept having to do the same type of thing

259
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:35,639
every time there was a new VM in the

260
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:37,199
network that I tried to go after I'm

261
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:38,668
like well I ain't got time for this

262
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,559
because I had to work at Vanderbilt and

263
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:42,899
I only had a few hours a night to study

264
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,570
so I just kept trying to automate

265
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:47,039
automate automate and as you go on and

266
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,840
go on client site there's different

267
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,990
things that you learn that you need to

268
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,580
automate so putting together a quick

269
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:57,600
example for you

270
00:21:53,580 --> 00:22:00,480
now let's say if you someone mentioned

271
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,759
version detection back there by the way

272
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,179
in math one thing that blew my mind on a

273
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:09,149
map when I was starting to learn it was

274
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:10,769
the order in which the flags went it

275
00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:13,139
doesn't matter every book that I saw her

276
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:14,639
every article I saw on in map the flags

277
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:16,678
were in different orders it doesn't

278
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:18,428
matter that were that the flags are go

279
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,179
in so if

280
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:25,779
you want to add version checking to this

281
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:30,789
is capital V now this greatly reduces

282
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:34,049
your scan time excuse me

283
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:36,070
so just be aware of that if I want to do

284
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:39,129
let's say I want to do the version

285
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:41,860
detection on that on the Linux I want to

286
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:43,748
get the I shown the Linux I wanna do the

287
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,019
version detection but on the windows up

288
00:22:43,749 --> 00:22:46,149
here

289
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:50,409
I want to guess for the operating system

290
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:56,408
so that's a capital o now let's see

291
00:22:50,409 --> 00:23:01,509
maybe down here on the databases that I

292
00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:04,629
want both I can do a minus a and that

293
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:09,429
does version of tection OS detection it

294
00:23:04,629 --> 00:23:14,649
also does traceroute and it also does

295
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:16,869
basic in map scripts against this so

296
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:24,629
there's three additional flags for you -

297
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:24,629
OH - SV and - a ok

298
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,909
okay if you want to run just the basic

299
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:39,429
scripts let me do this right here just

300
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:40,419
the basic scripts is minus SC if you

301
00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:42,190
want to do all that that's why I'm

302
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:46,570
saying so that gives you something in

303
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:49,299
order it's 21

304
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:58,408
that's right back on it I always forget

305
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:58,408
that okay so I'll probably do this

306
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:03,179
because I'm anal retentive

307
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,139
all right so I'm trying to teach you

308
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:14,500
hacking along with just bash scripting

309
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,880
because if you're if you don't you need

310
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,680
to be able to have a purpose when you're

311
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,540
putting together your bash script or any

312
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,640
type of scripting if you have a purpose

313
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,350
and a tool that you want to do and you

314
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,780
know how the tool that you're trying to

315
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:27,310
put a wrapper around mix it out so we're

316
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:32,260
trying to we're kind of doing our

317
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:40,000
requirements here okay something up here

318
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:42,010
that I did not talk about so again if

319
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,560
I'm running these scripts down here at

320
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:47,770
the bottom and notice that I didn't I

321
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,629
didn't put any type of flag in to give

322
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:51,550
user feedback and I said you know I want

323
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:55,240
to be able to do that say every 15

324
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:57,399
seconds sometimes you that you and

325
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,940
you're on a new network you're like okay

326
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:04,840
did my VM crash did my computer crash is

327
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:07,330
my link to their network good do they

328
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,040
have a problem with the firewall or I

329
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:12,669
was even now--if doing an assessment one

330
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:15,129
time and there was actually another true

331
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:17,650
derp from Australia was in the network

332
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:20,890
at the same time I was performing at

333
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:22,360
Pinterest and the sadness kept coming to

334
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:24,280
me you're like man we told you not to

335
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,550
scan these boxes they're out of them

336
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:30,340
like hey man here's all my stuff here's

337
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:32,590
my target list as you can see from you

338
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,199
know all my notes and everything I'm not

339
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:37,750
doing that a side note here real quick

340
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,150
whenever you're doing consulting and and

341
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:42,100
scanning and stuff it's extremely

342
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:45,760
important that especially when you're on

343
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:49,149
multi day engagements sometimes your IP

344
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:52,030
will change daily sometimes before lunch

345
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:54,220
and after lunch but make sure that you

346
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:55,960
always check what your IP is and your

347
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,780
MAC address so you can note that stuff

348
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,820
down one time I was out of an engagement

349
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:03,720
and they were trying to prove that the

350
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:06,070
sysadmin that ran all the firewalls was

351
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,710
doing nefarious stuff on the network

352
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:11,649
that guy just happened to be on vacation

353
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:13,870
during the assessment well while he was

354
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:16,330
on vacation he was remotely logged in

355
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:17,679
and was jacking with us while we were

356
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:20,889
performing the gates but he was

357
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:24,190
switching firewall rules on the fly

358
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:26,470
changing our the ACLS it was just a

359
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:30,250
nightmare and we kept getting new IP

360
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:33,130
addresses every hour but we we

361
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,840
constantly noted you know what yrp

362
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:36,910
addresses were and we're able to get

363
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,709
around that so quickly if I'm just doing

364
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:42,880
a health check and for me it's Network

365
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:47,230
what does this output right here look

366
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,299
like to you all what come in yeah and

367
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:53,440
that's that and what's that stats

368
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:55,809
showing me okay it's shown me so you can

369
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:07,960
tell what's running on on on my cally

370
00:26:55,809 --> 00:27:10,360
box here post grass SSH port mapper so

371
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:13,299
then I can see here's my external IP

372
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:18,580
address here's my internal IP address

373
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:19,990
don't hack me MAC address so on okay so

374
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:23,639
it gets all that information for you

375
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:26,950
then I ping Google three times and

376
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:31,720
that's it so I can just quickly go to my

377
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:34,330
computer again see to clear the screen

378
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:37,990
like ah am I stuck what's going on get

379
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:40,389
in for Network do a quick health check

380
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:45,900
yep I'm up and running how do I do that

381
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:45,900
that's all in my my alias file

382
00:27:53,830 --> 00:28:02,350
so here I'm setting up various variables

383
00:27:57,869 --> 00:28:05,918
for DNS here's my external IP I'm just

384
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:06,580
doing a a curl from IP from this website

385
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,950
right here

386
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:14,610
don't a little slicing and dicing to

387
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:18,009
grab that same with IP same with Mac

388
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:21,758
same with the user and then down here

389
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:23,830
I'm just stringing all those together so

390
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,450
there's my Nets that come in here's the

391
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:30,039
variable that I already set aside for

392
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:35,369
the external IP II internal IP MAC

393
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:35,369
address DNS ping Google three times

394
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:48,389
everyone understand see how I set that

395
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:48,389
up again I use this stuff non-stop

396
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:54,999
I have another alias right here for to

397
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:57,039
update my whole system and it's

398
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:59,769
basically it's calling you can use an

399
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:03,149
alias to call another script which I'll

400
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:03,149
do here in a second I'll show you that

401
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:12,399
alright so let's take a little ten

402
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:16,389
minute break here and let's see go ahead

403
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:19,299
and go ahead and set you it up a dot

404
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:22,168
bash underscore alias file in your root

405
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:25,690
directory and let's add in some

406
00:29:22,169 --> 00:29:28,450
shortcuts for yourself if you're doing

407
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:30,909
Kali see if you can figure out how to to

408
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:33,029
start the Postgres database initialize

409
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:35,679
the data initially is the database

410
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:37,830
correctly and then start the Metasploit

411
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,830
framework

412
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:46,879
you all should be paddling on your

413
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,880
keyboards right now

414
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:03,600
okay so once you have that that file set

415
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:06,480
up it needs to be able to run so the

416
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:10,520
first time if you're working on in the

417
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,520
same window you want to do a source

418
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:24,400
like that and what that does is it loads

419
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:26,530
that into the terminal if you shut the

420
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,140
terminal down and open it back up it

421
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:32,920
loads that file automatically because of

422
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:36,520
the batch arts dot bash RC script so

423
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:47,950
refresh your script just pull that back

424
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:53,889
up here in case you go hisses so there's

425
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:57,010
your example do a alias a character

426
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:59,080
equals single ticks and whatever batch

427
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:05,020
but whatever Linux command that you want

428
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:07,060
to do this one right here the D is

429
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,950
tricky because you're going to go your

430
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,780
desktop well the first thing you're

431
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:15,190
going to do is need to set up who the

432
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:18,580
user is and we did that up here by the

433
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:24,010
user equals dollar sign parenthesis Who

434
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:26,620
am I I want you to create in your own

435
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:31,930
alias file for shortcuts that you do all

436
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:35,050
the time and one of the examples I

437
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:37,600
wanted to do was what you do with the

438
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:40,139
Metasploit example if you're running

439
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,139
Kali Linux

440
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:51,070
figure out how to grab your own IP

441
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:51,070
address and your external IP address

442
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:11,470
you know if there's a certain folder

443
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,910
that you're going to all the time like

444
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:19,480
you're always going to VAR logs whatever

445
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:22,450
mail you know put you know m1 or

446
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,370
whatever or mm or something that you

447
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:27,100
know that helps you get to that folder

448
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:31,600
very quickly so do your navigation stuff

449
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:35,850
first and then work on you know how do

450
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,850
you get your desktop folder very quickly

451
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:45,330
set up this variable and then call it

452
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,330
down here

453
00:32:54,019 --> 00:33:02,940
I'm sorry more time Terminator

454
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:05,850
and then Terminator allows you to split

455
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:11,029
the screens horizontally in vertical and

456
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:11,029
used to app apt-get install Terminator

457
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:42,260
why you are doing this is there any

458
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:47,919
questions you have maybe on pen testing

459
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:47,919
in general consulting bash scripting

460
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,780
networking

461
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:20,490
that loads automatically I'm sorry know

462
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:24,210
that the that only runs once when I run

463
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:27,390
the end for networking every time you

464
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:30,030
open up a new terminal via the bash RC

465
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:32,490
file that's hidden it says hey if

466
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:36,330
there's this file located in your home

467
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:37,709
folder load this into memory and if you

468
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,509
manually work on this file and you're

469
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:43,290
like oh my god my my alias is aren't

470
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:47,210
working you do source dot bash

471
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:47,210
underscore alias it loads it into memory

472
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:58,670
right so if I did in right now now it's

473
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,670
making a call

474
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:29,400
and right here's that URL IP - API comm

475
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:38,190
anyone know what the S flag is for for

476
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:38,190
curl silent

477
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:55,480
second one

478
00:36:55,610 --> 00:37:00,350
you're grabbing the your you're grabbing

479
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:02,330
what your delimiter is field one it's

480
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:05,299
gonna be the first thing to the left of

481
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:10,190
that field two is going to be the next

482
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:17,540
thing to the right of that does everyone

483
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:18,950
see that how are we going to clean this

484
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:23,140
up you can clean this up with one more

485
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:28,210
thing okay with a delimiter of what

486
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:29,450
right parenthesis what field exactly

487
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:32,690
done

488
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:39,770
that's way faster than what we did the

489
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:42,140
first time so you can use anything as a

490
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:48,190
delimiter first time we just used the

491
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:48,190
space this time we used parentheses

492
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:25,540
any questions on piping the output to a

493
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:31,360
file any question on piping commands any

494
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:36,029
questions on grep or any questions on

495
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:36,030
cutting with a delimiter and fields

496
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:48,350
what if I wanted let me get back here

497
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,850
any questions on that

498
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,649
Bueller

499
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:11,730
again we're just we're coming we're

500
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:13,140
coming to that yeah I want to get to

501
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:16,380
this before we get to the more complex

502
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,430
ones okay this is as basic as we're

503
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,990
gonna get because we're going to build

504
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:23,330
upon this so if there's any questions or

505
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:26,069
you want to do another example yep

506
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:28,650
alright so let's go back clear the

507
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:34,650
screen let's see we got cat and temp

508
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:39,980
okay let's do how about let's grab the

509
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:45,050
time that it took in milliseconds okay

510
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:47,760
so we want to get the three numbers

511
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:51,660
forty three point three two and so on

512
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:55,130
okay see if you all can come up with

513
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:55,129
those three numbers on yourself

514
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:28,660
if I said I want to cut with the

515
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:30,990
delimiter of space what field would I

516
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,990
want

517
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:46,450
eight count again

518
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:55,299
one would be 64 2 would be bikes 3 would

519
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:59,410
be from that makes sense 3 4 5 6 7 7

520
00:40:55,299 --> 00:41:02,190
don't say so I did I'm sorry you're

521
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:06,750
right all right

522
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:06,750
does everyone see how we get 7 with that

523
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:12,160
if you don't we need we'd really need to

524
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:23,170
hammer this down nap cause it's just

525
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:31,750
gonna get more complexed okay if we said

526
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:34,829
cut with a delimiter of MS what field

527
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,829
what I want

528
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:45,600
we'll be one member where your delimiter

529
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:53,430
is figure out where that is and then to

530
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:56,730
the left of that if I said so let's just

531
00:41:53,430 --> 00:42:00,419
do these real quick see cut with a

532
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:06,120
delimiter of a space we went field I

533
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:07,970
believe you said seven cool up nope

534
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:12,980
sorry

535
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:12,980
eight that was right

536
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:22,160
now if I want just the numbers and I

537
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:22,160
don't want the loss how can I get that

538
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:28,350
what's unique on the land with the

539
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:33,480
numbers that's not that doesn't have

540
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:43,200
them the loss someone said equals so

541
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:46,170
grip four equals sign absolutely now let

542
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:53,310
me show you the inverse of grep is grip

543
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:57,600
minus V which means take that away so if

544
00:42:53,310 --> 00:43:07,620
I want to do a grip minus V I don't want

545
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:14,750
anything with loss okay and I don't want

546
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:14,750
anything with the space have it in word

547
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,580
just we'll stay with that

548
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:32,700
now to get rid of those spaces I could

549
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:34,730
say grip four and we're back to where we

550
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,730
were

551
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:45,319
now from here I just want the numbers

552
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:50,839
what's our next command should be our

553
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:50,839
last command

554
00:43:50,869 --> 00:44:04,500
cut with the delimiter of equal sign and

555
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:07,520
give me a field excellent well easy

556
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:11,060
enough all right what I want you to do

557
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:21,770
is I want you to grab your IP address

558
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:21,770
from ifconfig that's your exercise I

559
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:30,060
want you be able to grab that the first

560
00:44:28,349 --> 00:44:33,650
thing you got to do is pipe that out to

561
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,650
a field or piped it out to a file

562
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:55,299
all right what's the first thing we're

563
00:45:41,980 --> 00:46:02,349
crafting for thank you awesome

564
00:45:55,299 --> 00:46:05,788
give me the IP address I want the IP

565
00:46:02,349 --> 00:46:05,789
address now how do you get that

566
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:29,140
why did that happen it's a trick what do

567
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:34,119
you see there there's actually a bunch

568
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:39,359
of spaces in front of my net so this is

569
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:39,359
kind of a tricky one what's that

570
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,520
okay well let's just try that so let's

571
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:59,078
get with the delimiter of that and show

572
00:46:48,520 --> 00:47:02,280
me field what yeah that's not gonna work

573
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:04,630
so let's go back to a space now if we

574
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:08,829
estimated the amount of spaces it's

575
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:10,380
gonna be one two three four five six

576
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:13,000
seven eight

577
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:24,059
let's do that let's see Kelvin

578
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:26,140
eight nine ten okay that's pretty sloppy

579
00:47:24,059 --> 00:47:29,319
so let's cut with the delimiter or

580
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:35,578
something else what else could we kept

581
00:47:29,319 --> 00:47:35,579
use a delimiter is what about a word

582
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:42,089
what field

583
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:51,769
so can't do that we can only use a

584
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:51,769
single space

585
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,790
okay now what

586
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:15,700
what's your delimiter okay field what

587
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:23,240
there's nothing to the left of that

588
00:48:18,589 --> 00:48:25,540
first base but to the right of it is

589
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,540
your IP

590
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:34,350
multiple ways to skin a cat all right

591
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:36,810
we're going to do this another way here

592
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:39,650
in a second so the next command I'm

593
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:43,950
going to introduce you to it's called

594
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:46,260
head to do this and one do you I'm gonna

595
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:47,549
get a bigger file so I'm just going to

596
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:53,880
do a man

597
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:58,619
SSH pipe that out to attempt to so if

598
00:48:53,880 --> 00:49:05,820
I'm cat 10 to you Jo

599
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:09,590
if I do I can do pipe more and that will

600
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:09,590
show me the file a page at a time

601
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:16,710
everybody see that

602
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:20,460
I hit Q to X without that now the head

603
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:27,060
it's going to show me the first 10 lines

604
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:34,010
of the file if I want the first eight

605
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:34,009
lines of the file I can do that okay

606
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:45,570
now the opposite of head is tail so the

607
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:50,279
default is ten lines that shows me the

608
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:53,270
last 10 items that would be really

609
00:49:50,280 --> 00:50:00,570
useful for viewing what Linux admins

610
00:49:53,270 --> 00:50:05,180
what very good what's the last ten

611
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:07,410
entries in my firewall tail the log file

612
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:16,080
instead of scrolling all the way through

613
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:20,250
it okay show me the last entry show me

614
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:23,040
the last five entries makes sense all

615
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:26,970
right now using that example let's go

616
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:30,359
back here to to this skin the cat the

617
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:34,850
different way how can we grab the IP

618
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:34,850
address using the head command

619
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:53,660
IP addresses on what line second all

620
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:56,419
right so cap tip head that's into that

621
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:58,629
not Oh showing us the first two lines at

622
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,630
right

623
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:09,829
so let's I'm just trying to trip you up

624
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:11,780
here let's get rid of the first line how

625
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:30,020
are we how do we remove the first line

626
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:33,410
using what what grip for what what okay

627
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:35,900
and what I want to do the reverse of

628
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:37,670
that I want to get attacked that from

629
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,910
another angle let's delete the first

630
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:44,450
line that one we searched for the second

631
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:45,770
line with grep let's say let's think

632
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:52,210
about this differently we want to get

633
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:52,210
rid of the first line grep - V eth0

634
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,210
gives you the same thing I'm just

635
00:51:57,710 --> 00:52:01,640
showing you a different way in this

636
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:04,039
example it doesn't make sense with two

637
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:07,400
lines but in a minute it's going to make

638
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:11,000
sense so again we're just talking the

639
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:13,609
problem from different angles okay now

640
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:17,980
so we got grip is to search for a string

641
00:52:13,609 --> 00:52:21,250
we got grip - V is to get rid of a line

642
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:24,109
let's say if we want to get rid of

643
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:27,079
multiple lines for that we're going to

644
00:52:24,109 --> 00:52:30,049
use eat grip - V so let's go back to

645
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:32,319
temp let's get rid of this tired of

646
00:52:30,049 --> 00:52:32,319
looking at that

647
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:48,240
okay oh let's see here so let's do who

648
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:48,240
is your favorite website let's just do

649
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:58,180
tip okay grab whatever your favorite

650
00:52:54,730 --> 00:53:02,819
website is grab the who is on it and

651
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:07,500
take a look at it now who is is freaking

652
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:11,890
notorious for not following its own

653
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:15,819
standards so to speak every URL or every

654
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:17,049
domain that you do who is on information

655
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:19,680
is going to come back and differently

656
00:53:17,049 --> 00:53:24,040
okay

657
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:29,410
so this gets where to the cleanup thing

658
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:32,680
that I was talking about so again you

659
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:34,720
can use Target calm that's fine what

660
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:38,020
we're interested in is this information

661
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:40,779
up here right there

662
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:44,740
and we're not really interested in any

663
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:50,140
of that information but we do want the

664
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:54,790
rest of this and we don't want this crap

665
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:55,750
down here so I'm gonna make this for

666
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:59,440
this particular example

667
00:53:55,750 --> 00:54:03,790
everyone just do who is on target comm

668
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:10,680
say that out to file I didn't talk about

669
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:10,680
editors the easiest editor is G edit

670
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:22,450
because it's a GUI notice if you do G

671
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:23,950
edit your terminal is tied up okay I

672
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:26,200
don't ever want to talk tie up my

673
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:31,509
terminal if you exit out of this with

674
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:34,328
ctrl C then your G edit program is is

675
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:35,710
gone so in order to grab your terminal

676
00:54:34,329 --> 00:54:41,730
back does anyone know what you add to

677
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:46,390
end the line what exactly

678
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:48,430
so now got my program herb my text up

679
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:50,680
and running I also got

680
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:52,690
control my command line back okay so

681
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:55,930
always do that so that's one way easy

682
00:54:52,690 --> 00:55:02,200
way to cut stuff up let's just pull your

683
00:54:55,930 --> 00:55:04,629
file up and let's say let's grab the see

684
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,220
we got all the name servers here and

685
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:08,560
let's get all the tech stuff let's just

686
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:11,439
delete everything from there at the top

687
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:16,660
and we're just gonna do with the GUI for

688
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:26,980
this example save that back out get out

689
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:30,069
of this okay so all we want is this

690
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:32,020
information right here we don't want the

691
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:34,210
rest of this information we can attack

692
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:35,740
this two different ways we can say what

693
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:37,750
do we want to grep for what do we want

694
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:41,740
to pull out or what do we want to get

695
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:48,510
rid of okay first of all let's just grab

696
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:48,509
what we want how do we go about this

697
00:55:56,230 --> 00:56:08,950
what are in these lines that are in no

698
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:08,950
other lines what okay : very good

699
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:19,930
okay so we got it paired down but we

700
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:22,180
still got crap at the bottom we don't

701
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:31,049
want okay this is we're going to use the

702
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:31,049
grep - V sorry Ygritte - V so V grip - V

703
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:37,240
alright so in here I can put multiple

704
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:39,490
string values so for example and I'd

705
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:45,879
normally just use what's at the front

706
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:48,220
like or so let's just do URL and I'll do

707
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:51,660
a pipe between each one

708
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:51,660
I don't want notice

709
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:05,290
see I was able to pull that out with

710
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:14,129
three words so I'm looking for words

711
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:14,130
that are in multiple ones back here name

712
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:21,809
last

713
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:36,109
okay in this particular example that's

714
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:37,250
how to use egress - V alright that's an

715
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:39,610
hour and 15 minutes let's take a

716
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:39,610
10-minute break

717
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:54,770
you
