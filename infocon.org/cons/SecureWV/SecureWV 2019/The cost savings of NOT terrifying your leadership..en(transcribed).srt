1
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:15,969
all right good afternoon everybody

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,530
my name is Daniel Esau I am a security

3
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:19,840
manager for a pharmaceutical company

4
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:22,779
here in West Virginia you can all

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,110
probably guess that won today's talk a

6
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:27,580
little bit about the cost savings of not

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,700
terrifying your leadership I don't know

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:33,180
how many of you have worked with various

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,920
departments a thing to do is they

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,989
especially in your c-suite they catch an

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,030
advertisement walking down a hallway or

12
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:42,280
at a conference or somebody called says

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,839
hey by this new awesome sweet pool and

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,420
nothing whatever they're wrong again

15
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:49,300
well I hate to tell them that's not the

16
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,670
case but there is a ton of data that we

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,140
sit on in the security realm that can

18
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,719
change a lot of that everything from

19
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,249
access control records to use your

20
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:59,829
behavior and that's something we're

21
00:00:57,249 --> 00:01:02,019
going to address a little bit here so on

22
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:05,620
the site on the business side of things

23
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:07,380
we're looking at just how we can save

24
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,790
money and how we can improve the program

25
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,210
security by nature is a non revenue

26
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,890
generating service so how do we cut our

27
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:20,440
costs you'll provide the same service

28
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:22,390
and not lose people or equipment again

29
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,720
my name is Daniel if you want to get a

30
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:27,010
hold of me you have LinkedIn my Twitter

31
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,800
account is freakazoid

32
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,850
I'll go ahead and get this yes I know

33
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,360
for everybody in the room that laughs

34
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:36,070
yes that was the intended effect all

35
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,100
right so we'll get started

36
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:41,020
what is the the idea of this it's

37
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,390
approaching security from a business and

38
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,100
data perspective there's so much data

39
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,670
that generated every single day

40
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:52,149
everything from user logins to activity

41
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:54,280
to access control records to when

42
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,570
they're entering the building and a lot

43
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,280
of security departments whether you're

44
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,509
in the physical security realm or in the

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,950
information security realm sit on this

46
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:02,410
data and you don't realize the value

47
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,750
that it provides there's no cost

48
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:07,690
associated with it all the generated by

49
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,949
your users every single day and you can

50
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:12,040
detect trends as they're happening

51
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:13,629
before they become an issue it's not

52
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,299
designed to be a hype talk I have sat

53
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:18,579
through many analytics talks that

54
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:21,610
they're like yes by our product this

55
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:24,880
will solve all of your issues

56
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,290
by this module integrate this that's not

57
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,040
the idea behind this the idea behind

58
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:33,070
this is to give you the idea of how to

59
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,209
best approach it and to how to even

60
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,760
approach your leadership about

61
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,860
implementing a program like this and

62
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,840
again like I said methods for achieving

63
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,760
your goal will cover some very basic

64
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,890
mathematical terms I'm not gonna take a

65
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,209
deep dive into it because to be honest

66
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:52,720
there are times that I even get a little

67
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:54,220
glazed over I've got two quotes here the

68
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,870
first won't let you read the second one

69
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,030
kind of pops up across my Twitter feed

70
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:01,810
and it made me made me laugh but it

71
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,640
proves a point that if you're not

72
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,750
supporting the bit the business needs

73
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:09,100
and objectives then you're not doing

74
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:11,709
security that you can't say that enough

75
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,049
I have met many security departments

76
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:15,280
that impede business and the very first

77
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,959
thing that happens is that you have a

78
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,270
clash you have a clash between

79
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,990
production of a clash between marketing

80
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:24,880
and there becomes an adversarial

81
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,230
relationship with security and people

82
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,049
don't report things they don't want

83
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,010
security to be a part of it they don't

84
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:34,030
even take security recommendations

85
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:35,320
seriously at that point so the idea

86
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,800
behind this is is that instead of

87
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,480
impeding the business we start finding

88
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:46,330
ways to support it through the data that

89
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:48,940
the business generates the average cost

90
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,470
for a small company for a basic security

91
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,530
program is around three thousand dollars

92
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,450
annually that is very basic hardware and

93
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,160
around a thousand dollars a year in user

94
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,958
training and that's very basic that's

95
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,900
just to keep your users from you know

96
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,280
clicking links and sharing things and

97
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,140
you know accessing their personal

98
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,830
Dropbox from the corporate network and

99
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:12,089
taking files home that way I've met a

100
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:15,010
lot of agencies that tend to build their

101
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:18,070
security defenses like the Maginot Line

102
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:20,108
it looks great it sounds great when you

103
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:24,520
sit down on a presentation you're like I

104
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:26,349
have all this in place but you missed

105
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,310
one trend or one involving threat and

106
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,310
it's no good anymore

107
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:38,350
I think the worst one was ransomware

108
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,890
users are great about not clicking links

109
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:45,640
but they open up a PDF or open up a Word

110
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:50,229
document from the CEO and the next thing

111
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,729
you know a helpdesk what why is my

112
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:58,030
computer blue and why does it say I have

113
00:04:51,730 --> 00:05:02,290
to pay in Bitcoin what's Bitcoin and the

114
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:05,109
solution to this is to find a way to

115
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:08,020
balance between the need for security

116
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,730
and what processes you have in place so

117
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,740
every once the best perimeter defense is

118
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,680
best incident response the best-in-class

119
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:17,110
solution for everything but sometimes

120
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,610
that's not possible as a security

121
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,590
practitioner we live in the world that

122
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,880
we have to justify everything we want to

123
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,460
buy everything we want to do everything

124
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,500
we want to invest in whether its

125
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:30,909
headcount whether it's education whether

126
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:33,820
it's a new network defense so the

127
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,140
solution that I've come up with is using

128
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,360
the analytics on the data that we

129
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,640
provide or that we can generate and pull

130
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,040
from within the business there's no

131
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,680
better way to know what your business is

132
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:49,380
doing and what your users are facing

133
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,380
then taking that data and utilizing it

134
00:05:52,510 --> 00:06:00,440
in terms of a business case again we

135
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:03,550
were always faced with justifying why we

136
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,550
want to do what we're going to do I

137
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,210
forget the statistic right offhand but

138
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,360
the amount of data that's generated by

139
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:13,430
an individual on a daily basis is

140
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,970
growing exponentially your users are no

141
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,710
different everything from physical

142
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,800
security records such as access control

143
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:25,400
badging CCTV video badge clearance

144
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:30,080
assignments with just listening talk not

145
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:34,039
long ago about role based access you got

146
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,599
a thing of on both sides on the

147
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,389
information security side you have user

148
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,460
activity firewall traffic logs download

149
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:43,550
and transfer logs you have all this

150
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:46,430
disparate data everywhere but if you

151
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:48,560
compile it and understand and you

152
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:52,190
understand what your users thinking

153
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,960
doing behaving then you start to

154
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,240
understand ahead of time what kind of

155
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,340
challenges you might face if you've got

156
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,820
a user that spends all this time you

157
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,080
know browsing personal web forums it's

158
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,010
likely that you're going to have to

159
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,169
watch and make sure they don't pull

160
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:11,450
something in the other side of this is

161
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:13,909
that you have to know what kind of

162
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:16,060
insight you're looking for if you're

163
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,820
concerned about your information threats

164
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:22,479
or your I should say your your

165
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:27,650
information security looking at the

166
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:32,419
behaviors of your users kind of the best

167
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:34,789
way to phrase them the challenge that we

168
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:39,139
face and insecurity is or in as a

169
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:40,520
business is that a lot of businesses

170
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:43,389
will pull all this data together and

171
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,770
I've been involved with it we're a

172
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:47,389
senior leader comes to you and they say

173
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,039
we have all this information I want you

174
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:53,479
to tell me something about our security

175
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:55,849
program tell us how to improve it those

176
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:58,490
those those answers just don't bubble

177
00:07:55,849 --> 00:08:00,530
the top you have to know what question

178
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,280
you're asking are you concerned about a

179
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:05,479
physical issue are you concerned about a

180
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,628
information issue and we'll get into the

181
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:10,008
use case

182
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:12,469
more so if you're familiar with the

183
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:15,249
Apple case in January of this year

184
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:18,889
actually where the individual was

185
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:21,889
reported by fellow employees for taking

186
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:23,479
photographs of sensitive and proprietary

187
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:27,409
documents while on duty he was working

188
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:29,060
on the self-driving car and it kind of

189
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:31,960
crosses both boundaries will show you a

190
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,960
little bit more about that

191
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:37,279
again the intended effect is you can't

192
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,929
go from insights to actions if you don't

193
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,000
have a data-driven culture if you don't

194
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:44,769
have some way of understanding

195
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,699
everything that's collected designed

196
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:49,730
everything it happens within that

197
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:53,930
organization that data contributes to a

198
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:56,870
picture of your threat landscape you

199
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:58,849
start seeing users behaving differently

200
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,339
you start seeing employees as behaving

201
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,630
differently you start seeing your

202
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:05,800
high-risk employees who are on a

203
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:09,260
performance improvement plan all that

204
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:13,699
information compiled together you have

205
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:17,959
the ability to create vast insights into

206
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:19,430
what your potential threat may be so the

207
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:20,719
question is we have all this data oh

208
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:24,290
what do we do with it

209
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,140
that's been a huge question across the

210
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,779
board there are several steps to

211
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,430
building designing a program one is to

212
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:33,260
figure out what exact what data you have

213
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,199
and what can you do with it in

214
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:39,350
standardize the collection process I've

215
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:40,130
met I've been in several organization

216
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,220
I've worked with several organizations

217
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,899
that they just grab a whole bunch of

218
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:49,579
data and throw it and say look we made a

219
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:51,949
graph how do we fix this well that's

220
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:54,319
great that all your employees sign on at

221
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:57,439
8:15 that doesn't tell me anything about

222
00:09:54,319 --> 00:10:00,439
your behavior or threat well all of our

223
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,220
users like to email the files home well

224
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,959
you probably shouldn't allow that to

225
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,430
catalog the data and normalize it one of

226
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:09,649
the challenges of this data is it it's

227
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:12,739
nasty anybody who's worked with real

228
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:14,930
world data it's ugly it's misformed it's

229
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,640
free text a lot of time which if you've

230
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:19,810
had the joy of working with free text

231
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:23,000
data it's it's it's a joy

232
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:25,010
and you have to have a common naming

233
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,670
convention ratings weights things of

234
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,230
that nature

235
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,640
the reason for that is as we get a

236
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,690
little further we'll start looking at

237
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,530
the models that you can build to predict

238
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:37,100
behaviors and predictors forehead

239
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:39,170
landscape standardized methods for

240
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,070
accessing it I don't know about you guys

241
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:45,260
but there's nothing more irritating than

242
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:48,710
emailing a Excel spreadsheet back and

243
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:52,400
forth looking for revisions yo oh yeah

244
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:54,500
I've been in that place - so which

245
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,140
version did you send me the one at 2:30

246
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,490
- well I got one at 2:30 for is it is

247
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,550
that the right one no that with two

248
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:05,510
versions ago thanks outlook for leaving

249
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:08,540
that in my outbox utilizing atoll of

250
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:10,220
choice - the intersecting data a lot of

251
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,050
companies use proprietary tools again

252
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,600
the whole talk is not about being a

253
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:17,540
vendor specific some use open-source

254
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,550
Python are some like to use tableau some

255
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:22,400
use Alteryx

256
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:26,979
there are a ton of ways to make sense of

257
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:29,720
everything you're collecting and finally

258
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,370
my favorite part is leveraging AI and

259
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,670
machine learning to automate the process

260
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:36,170
the data there is not a single sensible

261
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,180
security practitioner or data

262
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,819
practitioner he's gonna ask you hey I

263
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:43,189
know that we're generating you know 30

264
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,810
gigs of data a day in just user logs I

265
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:46,910
want you to sit down and make sense of

266
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:50,000
it that's not happening I'll never get

267
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:52,310
anything else accomplished but the thing

268
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,430
about it is is that by leveraging these

269
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:58,060
technologies and leveraging these

270
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:01,310
algorithms and in different processes

271
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,959
you have the ability to set flags and to

272
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,900
catch user behaviors and then as it

273
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,430
moves even before it becomes an issue

274
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,890
not just your hard fast rules like

275
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:12,729
obviously blocking things like personal

276
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,540
file sharing sites but you start seeing

277
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,100
and again we'll get a little further

278
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,740
into it you start seeing certain groups

279
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,420
of users emailing files to themselves

280
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,820
well that's kind of odd why would they

281
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,650
be emailing policy themselves then you

282
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,990
start seeing this behavior happening and

283
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:30,319
it's not just a single red flag but you

284
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:31,610
see groups of things happening and it

285
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,139
also helps a little bit with reducing

286
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,689
your false positives

287
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:38,749
so again we'll go back to the users

288
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:40,519
emailing files to themselves instead of

289
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:42,379
flagging that as a security incident you

290
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,359
have the ability to go back and say okay

291
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:46,819
we've had 30 users do this and when you

292
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:48,230
see it happen every so often we need to

293
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:56,029
spend some time figuring out why they're

294
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:59,709
doing this in some user education so the

295
00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:02,509
use cases again user behavior an olympus

296
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:06,199
that is a huge buzz word right now when

297
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:09,470
it comes to the data and some of the

298
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:13,758
software packages out there employee

299
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:15,829
behavior these two kind of feed into the

300
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,439
the third PC inside a threat detection

301
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:20,290
and that's actually kind of what we're

302
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:22,639
looking at more so than anything

303
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:27,618
everybody looks for the logs outbound

304
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:29,179
connections coming in or DLP or any

305
00:13:27,619 --> 00:13:30,619
number of things but they don't look at

306
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:32,299
insider threats because they they don't

307
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:33,129
consider your average employee a major

308
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:35,629
threat

309
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:37,939
well they've they've been good to go

310
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:40,009
they we've not had any issues with them

311
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:42,110
we're not concerned about it even the

312
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:45,739
most model employee can make bonehead

313
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:47,980
mistakes and cause total chaos

314
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:50,540
you have ransomware you have data loss I

315
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,129
mean I I've met some employees that

316
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,169
think it's okay to clone their hard

317
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:55,429
drive their work machine on their

318
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:59,619
personal machine so they can take it

319
00:13:55,429 --> 00:14:02,269
home at night yeah I've seen it happen

320
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:04,669
or they you know called helpdesk and ask

321
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:07,489
for license for for company proprietary

322
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:10,040
software it doesn't go so well there's a

323
00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:12,579
lot of confused looks for that one and

324
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,509
it helps with protecting high-risk

325
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:18,849
environment and proprietary information

326
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:22,910
I work in a manufacturing world whereas

327
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:24,860
the there are locations that you're not

328
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,559
just looking at physical access you look

329
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,239
at information access you look at

330
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:31,969
proprietary records you look at research

331
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:33,709
and development you have a lot of people

332
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,809
think by keeping research development on

333
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:38,508
a paper format you reduce the risk of

334
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:40,519
walking out the door well if you're not

335
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:43,459
watching your employee behavior watching

336
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,869
your access records it'll walk out the

337
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:46,899
door and be reproducible you realize

338
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:49,670
it's gone

339
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:57,260
it's works just the same for again use

340
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:59,149
your behavior so and real quick as we're

341
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,640
moving along here if you have any

342
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:04,700
questions please stop me and ask as we

343
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,949
start diving into a little more into the

344
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,300
the background of this there's a lot

345
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:13,190
more to cover there's a lot more

346
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:14,390
in-depth discussion and now that real

347
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,100
quick another thing I want to touch on

348
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,050
with you behavior and again coming out

349
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,570
of the security department we look for

350
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,279
things we look for ways to justify

351
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,019
adding things one of the things with

352
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:25,519
collecting this data in utilizing this

353
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:27,890
data you have the ability to a couple

354
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,740
things with it one is a regression

355
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:33,230
analysis where you can do in resource

356
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,480
planning if you have more and more and

357
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,860
more instances where incidents are

358
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,470
coming up or you're having more and more

359
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,940
issues across the board you can show

360
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,550
over the course of the next several

361
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,640
months almost two years with some

362
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:50,120
significant accuracy that you're gonna

363
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,310
need more resources hardware there there

364
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,640
is not an easier way to win over funding

365
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:59,680
from budget than to be able to sit down

366
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:02,930
and show that this is what we've seen

367
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,109
this is what we've modeled this is our

368
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:08,479
prediction and it's going to get bad

369
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:10,010
then you have classification again your

370
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,260
employee and insider threat behaved

371
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,660
behavior once they meet a certain

372
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,100
threshold there needs to be a point

373
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,140
where they sit back and review what does

374
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,149
this user doing or what is this employee

375
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:22,579
doing are they a threat that they have

376
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:28,910
access to things they shouldn't are they

377
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:31,489
sharing files that they shouldn't be so

378
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:34,130
the question comes in up how how do we

379
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:36,800
do any of this what it sounds great it

380
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:39,829
sounds awesome that we can turn on an

381
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:43,099
algorithm ingest the data make sense of

382
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:45,859
it classify it and poof it wipes out a

383
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,050
lot of the manual work well one of the

384
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,959
things about it you have to establish a

385
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:53,240
baseline for the user if it's not

386
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,880
abnormal for them to log in at 2:30 in

387
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,339
the morning on a Saturday then it

388
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,590
doesn't be then whenever that flags

389
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:02,450
thrown you know that that's within that

390
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:04,360
users normal baseline that helps

391
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,530
mitigate some of your false positives I

392
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:09,139
can't tell you the number of times I've

393
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:12,260
had a false positive where somebody's

394
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,970
reported hey so-and-so badged in at

395
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,780
midnight on a Friday night

396
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:19,190
well that because they forgot something

397
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,129
or they're always there like we've seen

398
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:24,560
over the last six months every other

399
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:27,950
Friday or the Friday before a major

400
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,440
meeting they're in the office so it

401
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:34,160
helps to reduce that response to that

402
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:37,790
response but on the other hand again if

403
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,380
the users never badged in or is never

404
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,520
online after a certain time and all of a

405
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,050
sudden they're online pulling files

406
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,230
that's pretty clear we're gonna start

407
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:48,050
cutting access quick and that and you

408
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,690
catch that even before you lose a lot of

409
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:55,760
data and that's all on the baseline of

410
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:57,890
user behavior attackers who enter a

411
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,500
compromised credential or a compromised

412
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,820
badge often are not detected because the

413
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:06,530
behaviors not completely out of them a

414
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:09,679
possibility again we've seen things

415
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:12,770
where and I apologize I come from the

416
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,940
physical side more so and we've seen

417
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:16,460
where people have borrowed somebody's

418
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,680
badge and their badging in two places

419
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,740
and on the system it looks like somebody

420
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:24,110
else's badging in and that doesn't look

421
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,540
out of place but if you've lost your

422
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,129
badge and you go to badge in somewhere

423
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,420
and all of a sudden your badging in it

424
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:31,940
one o'clock in the morning and that

425
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,080
employees not even or is never in the

426
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:37,030
office at one o'clock that's a red flag

427
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,949
so by establishing a baseline for that

428
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:42,860
employee or those users it helps to

429
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:45,560
determine and kind of amplify those

430
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:48,830
issues when they happen but it also

431
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,810
helps reduce false positives again

432
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,800
leveraging employee history to determine

433
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:56,500
further analysis warranted utilizing

434
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,850
algorithms such as K nearest neighbors

435
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,970
Bayesian logistic regression you have

436
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:05,899
the ability to group things to look for

437
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:08,690
trends within your system it really

438
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,010
helps to understand what your users are

439
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,100
doing instead of going out and asking

440
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,210
users never going to admit that they law

441
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,580
that they

442
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:18,050
files I mean it basically get caught

443
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:21,050
sharing files on their personal Dropbox

444
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:22,520
now like oops I'm sorry but if you start

445
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:25,550
seeing groups and things of that nature

446
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,650
you can prevent or preemptively do user

447
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:31,149
education not just user education

448
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:34,580
sometimes it's even department education

449
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:37,760
whereas marketing may not necessarily

450
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,110
push that you need me please don't share

451
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,070
files like that on your own personal

452
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:45,139
Dropbox or you take a preventive action

453
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,669
and create a system where they can share

454
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:51,620
those files and they don't risk losing

455
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:53,360
them or don't risk data exfiltration by

456
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,909
using things like this you have the

457
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,620
ability to see that and kind of reach

458
00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:00,140
out it takes a little bit of a scariness

459
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:02,780
out of security again like at the outset

460
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:05,390
I said that there's nothing worse than

461
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:07,730
an adversarial relationship with the

462
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:09,170
rest of the business if they hate

463
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,180
security they're not going to want to do

464
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:12,560
it they're not going to want to play

465
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,000
ball they're not gonna want to report

466
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,679
things they're not going to want to be

467
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,700
part of the solution they're gonna think

468
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,330
that you're there to tell them whether

469
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,890
they're wrong or fire them I mean

470
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,050
typically when security comes knocking

471
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:28,730
at the door somebody goes what did I be

472
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:30,110
wrong now and again what kind of we're

473
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,820
gonna jump into the Apple case I'm

474
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,409
previously mentioned it thing about the

475
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,570
application January of 2019

476
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:37,160
there was an Apple employee working on

477
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:42,970
the self-driving car if it was reported

478
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:47,210
to his management for photos of

479
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:49,970
sensitive intellectual property so we're

480
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:51,350
gonna look back again let's take it at

481
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,220
takeoff we're gonna look at this from

482
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:56,540
two ways I should say the first way is

483
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,790
the way a lot of agencies do it now

484
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,110
where they're not looking at the data

485
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,100
they're not looking at behavior so

486
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:04,219
they're not looking at any of that stuff

487
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:06,919
it's hey they just reported John for

488
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,600
taking pictures of his laptop while

489
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,190
working in the sensitive lab well

490
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,949
obviously that's a big red flag and

491
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:14,150
right there's your incident so they go

492
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,040
in and they talk to and they find out

493
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:19,550
you know he's been taking photos for a

494
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,600
while during the investigation it was

495
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,669
determined that the individual had

496
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,149
backed up his work laptop to his

497
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:28,100
personal machine and he had over 2,000

498
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,080
files containing confident

499
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:33,320
proprietary materials related to the

500
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,500
self-driving car program incidentally

501
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:40,189
this was also when they busted people

502
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:44,030
for espionage corporate espionage for

503
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:45,260
the self-driving program now here's

504
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,240
where things get a little bit different

505
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,620
during investigation yeah it revealed

506
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:53,000
that the document theft begin as early

507
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:55,489
as June 18th right through hire so even

508
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,250
then he was doing actions that didn't

509
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:00,340
necessarily meet a threshold but there

510
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:04,270
was no analysis on what was going on

511
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:06,500
there was no elseis on the behavior the

512
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,629
actions he was doing when he was logging

513
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,340
and when he was in the facility again

514
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:15,890
like had mentioned badging in at odd

515
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:17,530
hours and he was also on a performance

516
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:22,340
improvement plan for about six months

517
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:24,080
prior to getting caught at the point

518
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:27,139
when he was actually caught taking the

519
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,500
photos he was actually do French our

520
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:32,840
meeting to be terminated so one of the

521
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,910
things that we see here is that if you

522
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,149
look at everything that was here it

523
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:41,090
seems like ever since some probably June

524
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:43,910
of 2018 there were flags along the way

525
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,169
that her data points even along the way

526
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:47,450
that indicated that there was an issue

527
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:49,120
that there was a thread there was a

528
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:52,510
high-risk employee working on a

529
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,699
confidential project that worth millions

530
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:58,220
but it wasn't seen it wasn't looked at

531
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:01,610
that way now let's look at it from the

532
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:04,670
other side if we're monitoring and

533
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:07,070
following up in using systems to look at

534
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:11,870
those data points you can already see

535
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:13,939
that the very bottom point he was on a

536
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:17,209
promise improvement plan that is a huge

537
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:19,460
red flag not necessarily not every

538
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:23,180
single person on a performance plan is a

539
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:24,260
red flag but it showed that it doesn't

540
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,380
have it in here but actually in the

541
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:29,860
article some of the other things that he

542
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:34,100
was noted in his web history of browsing

543
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:35,990
job forums he had applied for two or

544
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:41,060
three separate two or three jobs while

545
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:42,020
on duty was uploading files to resume

546
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:45,200
sites while on

547
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:50,480
well at the office none of that was

548
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,160
captured so by taking that data approach

549
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,550
that we were previously discussing and

550
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:57,350
looking at this it would only take step

551
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,700
two of step three before someone into

552
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,850
the part of the security department or

553
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:04,070
even analytics is going hey why is he on

554
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,928
job boards somebody check with HR and

555
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,760
see if he's on a performant plan I mean

556
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:11,090
everybody browses jobs at some point

557
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,530
just to see what's out there but there

558
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,629
were red flags throughout his entire

559
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:17,120
employment that indicated it was a

560
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:19,580
threat and it wasn't till after the date

561
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,219
had been exfiltrated and they didn't

562
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:27,649
found it did they realize that they were

563
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:29,360
all these flags so the proposed solution

564
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:34,280
like I had previously mentioned was is

565
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:36,740
to build a classification model where it

566
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:39,050
takes into account physical factors when

567
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,700
they're badging in how often the badging

568
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,080
is it out of the ordinary are they

569
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,320
getting rejection but are they trying to

570
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:48,460
badge into a certain section of the

571
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:51,169
company that they don't have access to

572
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:54,620
it could be as simple as hey I thought

573
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:55,670
my badge worked on all doors - maybe

574
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,000
they're testing to see if somebody

575
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:58,000
leaves it open

576
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:03,670
combine that with user behavior and

577
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:06,830
network traffic logs look at things like

578
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:08,900
hey are they that trying to badge into a

579
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:12,350
secure area that they're not they don't

580
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:14,540
have access to and they're posting stuff

581
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,860
about how they hate their job I don't

582
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,300
know about you guys but I know that

583
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,590
there are a lot of companies out there

584
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:22,100
that watch social media for their

585
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:24,590
employees when a employee begins getting

586
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,000
disgruntled or stating things on social

587
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,669
media like they would like to get back

588
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,670
at the company for what they've done

589
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:32,780
that raises their threat because then

590
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:35,840
you start looking at do they have access

591
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,010
sensitive information then you start

592
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,928
looking at things like what's their

593
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,190
network traffic

594
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:42,380
what are they saying what are they doing

595
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:44,750
and you start being able to build that

596
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:47,570
threat model you start seeing a little

597
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:50,120
more clearer picture come in of okay

598
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:52,189
maybe he's just having a bad day but we

599
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,590
need to look and see is he work on

600
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:58,100
anything that could cost us Millions

601
00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:02,669
there's where your cost savings comes in

602
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:04,850
it's not in its preventing that data

603
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:08,460
loss it's preventing that project loss

604
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:11,459
and like I said the last part of that is

605
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,440
the the bad records bad record to tell

606
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,690
you tons about somebody you've got

607
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,760
somebody on a performance plan you've

608
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:20,820
got Network logs or they're uploading

609
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,730
work documents for jobs and then they

610
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:26,189
start showing up late for work

611
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:30,690
they stop badging altogether there's a

612
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:33,800
sudden increase in absenteeism then you

613
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:39,140
start seeing red flags popping up where

614
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:39,139
they you probably need to check into it

615
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,610
some of the challenges to bringing in a

616
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:50,250
program like this lack of expertise

617
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,629
again it's it's a huge challenge you

618
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,590
start talking analytics and all of a

619
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,720
sudden they think they have to go out

620
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,770
and hire a data scientist for a hundred

621
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,990
forty thousand dollars a year

622
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:03,780
not necessarily not at all c-suite

623
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:07,440
leadership concerns it sounds awesome on

624
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:09,830
paper but it's not necessary if there's

625
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,680
concerns there's they don't understand

626
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:15,179
maybe your C suite or your senior

627
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,300
leadership just doesn't bought into it

628
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:22,170
yet they don't quite understand the way

629
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:25,290
you're mitigating things and lastly is a

630
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:26,670
maker buy solution again you if you have

631
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:29,310
somebody in-house that has that ability

632
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:33,000
to design and build this model and to

633
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:35,399
collect that data then by all means do

634
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,580
that versus going out and buying an

635
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,680
expensive product I don't know about you

636
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:44,550
guys but tableau is about $2,000 a

637
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:48,150
license and when you've got a very

638
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:49,649
budget-conscious program they don't

639
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:52,610
particularly like to spend that much on

640
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,610
one license

641
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:02,180
so get in the next part of this is how

642
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:04,970
do you sell it the cost savings this is

643
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,590
where the title came in we're not trying

644
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:10,640
to clarify leadership we're trying to

645
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:11,689
reduce buying frivolous items boy I

646
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,560
thought that was going to blow up on me

647
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:17,240
for a second there you're trying to

648
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,000
prevent from spending all this money in

649
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,310
places you don't have to there's no

650
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,970
better way to preserve a security

651
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:28,250
program then to find a way to cut costs

652
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,960
but still provide the same service we're

653
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,910
not losing people we're not losing

654
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,250
programs we're not losing access

655
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:36,800
we're not loot we're not losing a

656
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:39,560
service that we provide to them but

657
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:42,320
we're finding ways to reduce that

658
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:44,030
overhead to reduce that cost you

659
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,470
wouldn't know that would be a huge win

660
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,639
if you look back the Apple case said

661
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,950
then excused when if there's global

662
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,350
security department had walked in and

663
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:53,570
said hey he's been turned red flags last

664
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:56,240
six months we just talked to his manager

665
00:28:53,570 --> 00:29:01,100
and we need to have a conversation about

666
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:04,760
what's going on staying ahead of the

667
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:10,399
curve again we can either be behind the

668
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:12,800
curve where you're always reacting to an

669
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:17,270
event there's always a point in time

670
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:18,530
where you find yourself looking at

671
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:20,300
security and said oh how could I've

672
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:22,660
stopped this I don't know about you guys

673
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,800
but if you've ever had to do a kappa

674
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:28,460
corrective action preventative actions

675
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:30,110
on an incident sometimes it just feels

676
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,870
like you're smacking yourself in the

677
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:34,729
face going well I could have put that

678
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,959
this could have been prevented well this

679
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:39,080
is one of those methods people venting

680
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,830
it again all this activity happens on a

681
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:44,270
daily basis inside of an organization

682
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:48,620
there's no reason we can't harness that

683
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:50,510
data to design a better program use the

684
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:53,449
data that the individuals are filling or

685
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:57,500
creating to drive your security Pro to

686
00:29:53,450 --> 00:30:01,040
drive your security program and lastly

687
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:04,429
again driving a security program every

688
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:06,770
day employees generate tons and tons and

689
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:08,390
tons of data whether it's access whether

690
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:13,850
it's behavior

691
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:16,730
it's in some cases how often their

692
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:18,830
badging and off sites like there's tons

693
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:21,560
of things that you can do to be kind of

694
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:24,010
proactive you by utilizing analytics we

695
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:27,500
harness that data and the data exhaust

696
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:29,420
to assess where a higher risk is if you

697
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,740
have five if you have five people that

698
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,650
are working on a high-risk project

699
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:36,500
you're risking pretty low I kind of

700
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:38,680
laughed about it it doesn't make any

701
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,060
sense to buy a new firewall or new

702
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:45,380
anything if your users click on all

703
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:52,490
kinds of links again I go back to it

704
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:54,470
makes crazy Senate there was a story and

705
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:59,420
I'll give you a little better example

706
00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:00,560
where a marketing intern opened a email

707
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,960
she thought we're gonna CEO if she

708
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,429
thought man the CEOs emailing me she

709
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,400
needs me to take care of this needs me

710
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:10,120
to look this presentation over didn't

711
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,120
even think twice about it

712
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,100
opened it she goes huh that's funny I've

713
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,980
I don't remember how to sign into my

714
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,959
email but okay

715
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,640
less than three hours later the entire

716
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:29,810
company was spammed from her email

717
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:32,660
account pushing out that same malware so

718
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:34,520
by utilizing them it doesn't be any good

719
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,690
to buy all this new awesome stuff if

720
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,840
you're not looking at what your threat

721
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:40,430
vectors are and again we reduced the

722
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:44,209
cost and overhead by focusing on what

723
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:46,160
matters and where our risk lies plus it

724
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:48,950
makes us look good when we can meet

725
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:51,050
budget I don't know if you guys have

726
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,300
ever had to explain to a manager that

727
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:54,020
yeah we went a little over budget well

728
00:31:53,300 --> 00:32:01,280
how much is a little

729
00:31:54,020 --> 00:32:02,750
about 40% minor details and that pretty

730
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,010
much covers it like I said if you guys

731
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:07,430
want to reach out to me you can get hold

732
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:09,350
of me either way and I want to make this

733
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:11,060
more interactive this have questions I

734
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,860
know it was kind of a little different

735
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:16,399
direction in terms of the business

736
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:20,389
aspect but that's the thing that we

737
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:22,040
really have to look at is that the way

738
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:24,620
that our the employees

739
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,990
users behave indicates where your next

740
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:30,139
incidents gonna be if they like to click

741
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:33,790
links if they like to if you're fishing

742
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:37,550
campaigns or your training campaigns are

743
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:38,960
constantly having higher returns that's

744
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,340
probably a good indication that your

745
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,790
next instant it's gonna be a phishing

746
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:45,679
attempt with stolen credentials if

747
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:48,050
they're downloading random files off the

748
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,390
Internet that's probably where you need

749
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:52,100
to invest your next resource at so

750
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:56,470
instead of just throwing money at the

751
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:58,909
problem and hoping that it solves itself

752
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:01,790
you're actually able to pinpoint that

753
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:05,090
money that you do have and to create

754
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:12,040
more value for your organization and for

755
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:12,040
your department and that's it guys
