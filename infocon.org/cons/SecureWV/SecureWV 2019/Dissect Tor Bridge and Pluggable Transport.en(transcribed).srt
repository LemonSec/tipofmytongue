Greenlee send yourself and I'll conquer

Elena's talker so cool John and I are

3
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,050
you sure I was so sure about that tall

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:33,270
so who we are this is a Kunta hi I'm

5
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:36,840
picking tahini and this author look at

6
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,739
the firmness and their labs FM area

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:45,360
network a security company

8
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:49,080
I've had more than 10 years research as

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:53,629
three reasons the first is our customers

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,629
want to and defector Ithaca

11
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,050
the security on the toilet area

12
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:06,259
there's urban area we don't remember

13
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:10,789
that's where the integral over this is

14
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:14,250
where we talk well if it is at all and

15
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:22,740
then they introduce their anti sequel

16
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:30,030
technique is usually in top we'll talk

17
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:39,658
about the others first to me so what is

18
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:52,770
it it's mainly did where the floor meets

19
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:55,950
you know how to uninvite her here when

20
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,069
Melissa to consider Lydia's the Eternity

21

22
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:05,450
Katie family over surveillance all

23
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:12,290
furnaces so this is it with provider

24
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:17,580
Crusader unanimity calendar have you

25
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:19,829
typically create a surface which

26
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,370
comprised see whether you selected a

27
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,370

29
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:28,519
features for an assimilation the table

30
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:38,660
is beautiful on Fairfax's the two very

31
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:41,480
healthy touches the first tyrantrum and

32
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:45,620
the other is called open it maybe takes

33
00:03:41,480 --> 00:04:00,078
the order and officials about how are

34
00:03:45,620 --> 00:04:02,359
you nice in folder here this is over so

35
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:08,329
you see a clicker visit and home you can

36
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:11,810
see tensions and we make you say hi

37
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:17,350
browser version continued recent actions

38
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:17,350
are neither new options here

39
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:26,650
okay so environment within this new

40
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:33,340
situation and this is a crucial a

41
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:33,340
browser next 11 introduced in the toilet

42
00:04:33,840 --> 00:05:44,729
this mess with holy laser mystery unit

43
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:48,210
battery so I tested them on this

44
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:51,479
pancetta you can see the toilet paper

45
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:54,409
staffers we see us who shot this year

46
00:05:51,479 --> 00:06:24,479
etc so from busy

47
00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:27,960
you can see so we also see like an

48
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,900
observer from every other area so

49
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:37,770
colorful to be crazy a firsta it's an

50
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:41,159
example ancestor we can come so here you

51
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:44,130
can see but also correct Rashida between

52
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,650
these supplies and the food at home and

53
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:50,310
we cetera where ask me

54
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:52,590
missa missa missa but first we may

55
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,750
either you gonna keep them and a

56
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:58,250
secondly they either you tell me there's

57
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:01,050
something really easy you use your name

58
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:04,050
so imagine took a certificate of the

59
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:11,630
committee of an interpreter so this is

60
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:14,490
time T star circuit official website oh

61
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:16,770
well they asked me they asked really

62
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:20,000
laser on this separator I've officially

63
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:22,260
made is also called a time to Noda

64
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,770
second the relay he's also called a real

65
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:27,770
Noda yesterday's ask harder as you later

66
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:52,650
okay so how a second equation here there

67
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:54,719
are four steps well first to me Atlanta

68
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:57,690
selects three laser

69
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,490
I was um feel either under em even

70
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:02,430
murder

71
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:04,860
from the toll and Cory Bautista this is

72
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:10,590
grand finale they're ready when Queen

73
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:13,020
later and certainly landed nation which

74
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:18,119
is a actual murder and we need public

75
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:20,070
okay and the section K and are silly is

76
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,630
really smooth and kanuda

77
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,669
program that you template is the

78
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:26,430
organization this is a really murder

79
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:29,729
these popular K and there is another

80
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:33,060
session K family through the entry later

81
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:36,360
remember any know how Grammys

82
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:38,939
temperatures the ocean the ocean murder

83
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:43,500
you need to commentate anybody's ever

84
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:46,740
said okay there's simple faith healer

85
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,110
and I see you favoring the faculties is

86
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,410
right here at who their destination or

87
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:54,959
from the calendar

88
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:58,290
so does it resonate today

89
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,310
so this is army but we call it a river

90
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,310
it is

91
00:09:52,250 --> 00:10:58,710
so so and then this really nice

92
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:02,070
scientist when in the sense that in a

93
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:04,610
patina to the alternator so all

94
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,610
entrenador

95
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:12,800
isn't incredibly popular in 30 credits

96
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:16,529
either will see the second key I'm a

97
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:21,380
definition I was a real murder when the

98
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:25,920
sender sends a piccata and to a murder

99
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:28,170
so literally you have to grab the packet

100
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,329
which is the second key a look at

101
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:35,089
information over the action later that

102
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:43,830
if I send this packet to the murder

103
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:45,959
so this is did not declare z7k thank and

104
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:52,230
I will packet so I need to send the

105
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:54,209
packet to the destination so then let's

106
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:58,220
see how the companies in America for a

107
00:11:54,209 --> 00:12:12,709
minute restitution ever solar calendar

108
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:31,050
first to me and sends well then hey then

109
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:37,170
the same way okay then same way centro

110
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:43,500
de la nueva encuesta de then send send

111
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:46,649
via to render for family render we see

112
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:54,540
the same popular we see you in crap us

113
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:56,930
reach a visa such a mechanism an okay so

114
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,930
funny

115
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:05,839
you can see it's really when you're

116
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:14,270
dealing cetera all he needs is a

117
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:18,029
previous unless the real a destination

118
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:19,769
well we also learned also to be a memory

119
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:24,889
the destination

120
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:26,309
an assassin so we can say we can see

121
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:30,920
color

122
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:35,639
Perl provides biochemicals communication

123
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:39,599
and a whole paper and centers able to

124
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:42,299
circumvent the silver see the engine

125
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,999
Lancer is no because it and how it is

126
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:49,980
Alice today invariant hopf every so Ally

127
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:55,220
Bank on categories when I say Nene

128
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:59,449
Ortega this is a vanilla table we see

129
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:34,529
available then how to solve easy issues

130
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:37,979
how to circumvent anti censorship from

131
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:40,170
this panel will discuss what techniques

132
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:44,600
tour introduced therefore anti

133
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,599
censorship okay here we go

134
00:14:55,209 --> 00:15:00,969
introduce the two techniques to

135
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:06,910
circumvent censorship there are plaque

136
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:11,670
about transport and reduce our PT is a

137
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:14,350
short for plaque motors bird that

138
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:17,920
manipulates the torch ethic of each in

139
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:21,069
the torch and an employer made so that's

140
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:25,959
he Sinatra identifiable as a tour

141
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:29,878
traffic to support so much more PT seen

142
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:35,739
there's a whole basis that our analysis

143
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:39,670
and this is the pts I felt when this is

144
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:43,179
special to us sr22 screenshot that you

145
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:46,839
can say I found a a poor bottom we can

146
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:54,009
open the tor network settings right here

147
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:57,040
we can see the supportive the pts by the

148
00:15:54,009 --> 00:16:00,309
way other I mentioned that earlier this

149
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:05,469
is a recently told other question the

150
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:08,259
9.20 this at or another where something

151
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:11,290
is hard to bear integrated the two

152
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:19,410
tornados the option instead a state or

153
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:23,170
bottom of a second to occasional a

154
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:25,990
previous afore shot also has at all I

155
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:29,679
realize that have nots enlisted in the

156
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:32,619
mentor directory therefore this is

157
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:36,549
mainly the way to get to the company the

158
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:39,429
list also bridges so nobody can't block

159
00:16:36,549 --> 00:16:42,029
all bridges which is Celeste breakers at

160
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:42,029
designer for

161
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:50,489
[Music]

162
00:17:08,730 --> 00:18:07,120
is this okay without a bridge so the

163
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:12,520
sensor should oppose should I write here

164
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:15,309
to block the tour topic so yeah after

165
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,650
four pages that enabled the the call

166
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:20,889
traffic it will go down to already have

167
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:23,320
to fall bridget condon to be transformed

168
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:25,660
and their trust part or a trust fund on

169
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:37,510
the transporter as you can't you can't

170
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:38,549
they hear instead officer to agent or

171
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,919
interiorly

172
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:44,879
so the teacher number also really all

173
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,880
even keep this away

174
00:18:53,639 --> 00:20:20,228
in point all a PR connector section in

175
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:24,899
the debugger which is the earthing

176
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:24,899
called to make a TCP connections

177
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:35,918
analysis I think that easy usage of this

178
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:41,859
section from this lab to make TCP

179
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:46,839
connections to audio-visual a this is a

180
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:50,070
special is a debugger we've taken a

181
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:52,779
winter break point on this structure

182
00:20:50,070 --> 00:21:00,178
when triggered ever tell me to worry

183
00:20:52,779 --> 00:21:00,179

296
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:42,639
ready to transform a transporter to

297
00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:45,279
increase the traffic in this chapter I

298
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:47,889
will put into the detail of a hollow

299
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:52,080
beatiful McLaren a trustful and the

300
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:56,769
transports taught encrypt their traffic

301
00:31:52,080 --> 00:32:03,039
and the first is plan the data structure

302
00:31:56,769 --> 00:32:05,139
of the commander said conf start off is

303
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:11,440
the commander named after the beginning

304
00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:14,559
case and your speech ecourseware tells

305
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:20,320
you told that that major feature is

306
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:31,749
enabled about a year tenure and data

307
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:35,158
should be allowed so are you still here

308
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:39,549
I only keep the first time I hear it

309
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:43,869
should act emails will ask them starts

310
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:46,749
the way of their approach eCourse then

311
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:51,519
over for our hair tells our breed your

312
00:32:46,749 --> 00:32:54,580
type it's good to be over alpha or so

313
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,879
handsome so there's the next series of

314
00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:01,259
the bridge IP address on the part which

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,660
transport the public here and the verify

336
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:29,520
each other this is the survival shows

337
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:32,609
advertise the handshake packet which

338
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:36,720
consists of four four pairs Lenny is

339
00:35:32,609 --> 00:35:40,319
supply wealth of data in each part the

340
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:43,529
first part to the HMO is there plans to

341
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,990
keep her representative as I said which

342
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:49,710
can be used a to restore the car as a

343
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:52,140
public key or a service out but the

344
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:54,770
foreign party is running power a pending

345
00:35:52,140 --> 00:36:00,359
data which can be used in just for the

346
00:35:54,770 --> 00:36:06,500
h2y life so very long permanent data it

347
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:12,029
can be others Kate handshake Pekka sighs

348
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:30,780
the third part is H Mac why you also can

349
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:33,960
see the first policy is another issue is

350
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:38,190
a generous are the key instance using

351
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:41,730
this in a way that so classifies as a

352
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:44,720
solar cancer the sooner if I have cancer

353
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:48,710
handshake Gustavo has publicly further

354
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:54,660
representative after vacation is about

355
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:58,280
the civil process is separated and class

356
00:36:54,660 --> 00:37:01,080
public 8 to ECC disaffection

357
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,300
actually this camera and the seller for

358
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:06,180
this function and the past year they are

359
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:11,520
all a priority and is the others public

360
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:13,919
here to Terry to ascend without this

361
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,520
equal could it be our cornerstone and a

362
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,820
very important partner to ECC others in

363
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:25,520
which one makes the true side equal to

364
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:27,980
each other this obvious our sailor

365
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:31,369
called this function again with all

366
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:33,650
their supporters as soon as I deploy a

367
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:57,470
key and the class public here so

368
00:37:33,650 --> 00:38:00,800
generally say without a pair of the case

369
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:03,169
by which are the sooner super leaky and

370
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,230
the clients the public you as a notice

371
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:09,160
say as a be private key and the class

372
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:16,130
public you to generate to the comment of

373
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:17,660
the Education data now is the time to

374
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:22,609
make your service how chic a package

375
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:25,970
which is a similar to the class let's

376
00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:26,960
only see what the difference and it's

377
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:30,410
insertion sort

378
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:36,040
can you do jury to the US data after the

379
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:40,129
first part right here and the pending

380
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:48,170
component they have is a different value

381
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:50,359
site in size arranged to the plan sadder

382
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:52,850
is that the server's a hunch Inc packet

383
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:55,400
I serve as a particular view disturbed

384
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:59,630
for our service in representative a

385
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:02,030
class cause this infection there's a

386
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:05,750
chance that our panicky and the server's

387
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:08,060
public key on a colleague to again was a

388
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:12,109
classify a queue under the service

389
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:17,690
public a doctor Butte real self all that

390
00:39:12,109 --> 00:39:22,580
this is 64 encoding assert and inside

391
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:24,440
that's a virtue contribution level okay

392
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:28,340
speaking also I'll be public you as

393
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:29,140
there must be a I deploy okay I have

394
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:32,859
mentioned

395
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:47,430
many times before so I'm guessing where

396
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:50,589
it is what kind sin can charity to the

397
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:53,848
come and kiss the other with about about

398
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:58,839
to affection with us it's a computer

399
00:39:53,849 --> 00:40:01,260
data and to verify the seller as a

400
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:01,259
handshake

401
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:10,808
come on Casey

402
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:12,670
hey Sarah can proceed the true journey

403
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:19,890
to do a funnel encryption/decryption

404
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:19,890
case the harsher care processes at them

405
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:27,250
since then the audio Safari is ready to

406
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:33,578
transform and the trust paul decourt and

407
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:36,910
Christie to traffic lights of two

408
00:40:33,579 --> 00:40:42,309
functions of socket wrench function

409
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:46,690
under huge function as a seeding process

410
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:50,259
is a while support was tool needs to

411
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:54,210
send the request through inspection you

412
00:40:50,259 --> 00:40:57,660
know climate gets called will do the

413
00:40:54,210 --> 00:41:00,339
rest actually then causes a make

414
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:03,339
practice function to increase their

415
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:08,619
payload and their apparent depending

416
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:11,078
they'd have to H a teammate if the

417
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:16,630
trespass the family pack is to the beige

418
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:18,700
or solar the antecedent process is well

419
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:22,269
over a safe for candidacy of the pecky

420
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:25,118
the front of Bajor sailor all reefs

421
00:41:22,269 --> 00:41:29,229
function is called wheezes a receive the

422
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:34,420
packet inspection then cause every Pecha

423
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:38,640
function to decrypt the packet which

424
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:38,640
will be they ascended to the torque and

425
00:41:39,740 --> 00:43:34,368
okay in this debate you note there are

426
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:36,230
three okay and in this chapter I will

427
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:40,000
summarize over at the four majors some

428
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:40,000
masters against censorship

429
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,460
as a total of the traffic app I wrote

430
00:43:43,390 --> 00:45:07,359
about OB after four babies are harder to

431
00:43:45,460 --> 00:45:09,880
be a sensor too because even though this

432
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:12,609
is special to offer other pager shows to

433
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:16,680
the two ways each time you can up to

434
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:19,270
three or four babies are from about race

435
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:26,770
okay I'll see you all the time

436
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:31,240
option two what to do next is copy them

437
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:39,400
and their pista here together networking

438
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:49,029
Oh doc this is saxophone

439
