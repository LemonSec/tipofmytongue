1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,610
hi I'm Lucas Truex and I'm the director

2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,900
of cyber security engineering at

3
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:20,890
concurrent Technologies Corporation

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,240
which is a 501 C 3 non-profit R&D

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,310
institution headquartered out of

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,799
Johnstown PA which the only claim to

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,560
fame is getting flooded catastrophic Lee

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,410
twice but that's gonna come our

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,160
resiliency struggle right but um so I'm

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,279
here to talk a little bit about

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,959
compliance which is I know probably

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,430
everyone's favorite subject I expected

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,199
three people to be R so this is we're

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,750
like 9,000 percent above my expected

15
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:44,979
attendance because I mean as engineers

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,979
as people who like to solve hard

17
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:48,760
problems compliance really feels like

18
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:51,159
one of those things you just kind of

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,760
have to do but so I'm going to talk a

20
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:57,400
little bit about the cybersecurity

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,620
maturity model certification looked at

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,879
CMMI right before I came in here so now

23
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,049
I almost said their own thing to be a

24
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,519
cybersecurity maturity model

25
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:05,590
certification and why I think that's

26
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:06,880
relevant not just for the DoD which is

27
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,190
where it's coming out of but also for

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,470
the private industry and for you and

29
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,789
your day-to-day jobs so as I said I'm

30
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,500
director of cyber security engineering

31
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,899
at CTC we do a lot of different work

32
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,359
cyber security related on the research

33
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:21,850
side as well as on the more applied or

34
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,890
real side and for the intelligence

35
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,439
community a variety of DoD agencies as

36
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,509
well as some some private industry so

37
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:30,100
with that we'll jump right in so the

38
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:31,600
agenda we're going to talk about is I

39
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,359
already gave you the welcome so that

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,009
that's out of the way the state of

41
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:37,539
compliance so first of all why am I here

42
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:39,670
why do I care well you're probably here

43
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:41,979
because there was nothing else better on

44
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,630
the non just kidding then you're here

45
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:45,640
because we're all in information

46
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,810
security right and for some reason

47
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,689
people keep telling us we've got to

48
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:52,060
adhere to these stupid check box set of

49
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:53,350
rules so that's why we're here

50
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,719
we usually love to hate it and I think

51
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,408
the first the first slide there that's a

52
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,969
little tongue-in-cheek

53
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:59,170
the compliance standard you've always

54
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:00,818
learned how many of us have asked for

55
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,280
compliance standards before raise your

56
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:05,109
hand probably nobody right please put me

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,259
under compliance I really want to be

58
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:09,220
compliant today it doesn't happen so now

59
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:11,410
we're gonna talk a little about a little

60
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,370
bit about what is CMMC well first we've

61
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,440
talked about some of the struggles of

62
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,330
compliance why we really do hate it some

63
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,370
of those are valid concerns some of them

64
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,860
I think are just because it's paperwork

65
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,319
and we like to do fun engineering things

66
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,670
not paperwork I mean who likes the right

67
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:26,980
code comments

68
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,170
no we did not like to do that either so

69
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,329
and what about CMMC would like would

70
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,059
allow us to hate compliance less I'm not

71
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,680
going for today's objective to be hey I

72
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,630
would I would love to do compliance and

73
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,120
the original try this original title of

74
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,190
this was gonna be CMMC a compliance a

75
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,930
love story but I thought maybe a little

76
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,459
bit of a reach so what we're gonna do is

77
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,770
I'm gonna try to say that CMMC is a

78
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:49,570
model that is a little more fair in my

79
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,670
opinion and it allows us to hate the

80
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,410
compliance task a little less because we

81
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,000
can see the objectives and see some

82
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,850
steps towards other those objectives

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,520
that are reasonable all right so what is

84
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,109
CMM see who all here does DOD or any

85
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,810
type of federal government contracting

86
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,920
work alright so you may have you've

87
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,380
probably already heard of this Center if

88
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,268
you haven't welcome you get to hear

89
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,519
about it again but so CMMC

90
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:14,410
is a there's a model that the DoD put

91
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,060
out this past year they've been working

92
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,400
so do we they'll be finalizing the

93
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,050
coming year but it's it's a requirement

94
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,459
for cyber security as the slide says so

95
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,560
you now if you're going to do business

96
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,600
with the federal government you have to

97
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,070
do with it with a duty currently so the

98
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,420
long term plan for this is this will be

99
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,940
any business with federal government

100
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,809
current requirement is just UD but so if

101
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,600
you're going to do business with the

102
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:37,600
duty you have to have some measure of

103
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,400
cyber security compliance in place so

104
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,359
what it requires now is that you you

105
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,160
have to actually demonstrate your

106
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,750
compliance to a third-party Assessor and

107
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:48,700
many of us are used to this right PCI

108
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,930
DSS HIPPA GE PR excuse me all of this

109
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,190
most of those things have some type of

110
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,769
third-party compliance or audit

111
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,540
requirement so the penalty now and this

112
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:57,130
is where it gets fun is that you're not

113
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,298
gonna be allowed to do business with the

114
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:02,470
DoD going forward if you're not

115
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:04,540
compliant which is a change so what does

116
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,060
compliance come from so it really is a

117
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,859
necessary evil because it's I mean all

118
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,200
of us have heard the question from some

119
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:14,320
someone outside of like tech or geek

120
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:18,370
them maybe your manager okay

121
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,810
we're secure right we're secure and we

122
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,228
all know that this is that's not how it

123
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,320
works right

124
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:24,909
you know there isn't like just like the

125
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,530
secretary of state you'd said yes sir

126
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,419
you know you don't just beat terrorism

127
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,489
right you it's not like here's a

128
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:32,590
checkbox yes we're secure I installed it

129
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,200
we're secure there's no possibility of

130
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,969
attacks it's a state right but since the

131
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,560
beginning of computers people wanted to

132
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,600
know I wanted to verify

133
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,770
what the state of security is so

134
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,150
compliance is an answer to that question

135
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:48,099
so you know what my Linux admins I

136
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,080
believe you're doing a great job

137
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,270
but we need to find some way for someone

138
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,280
outside of our organization to verify

139
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,490
that so that's that verification piece

140
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,469
so if you all each of you

141
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,420
any one of you was it responsible for

142
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,700
trying to figure out what the security

143
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,550
posture if someone else was it may be a

144
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:09,460
good example would be hospitals so as a

145
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,540
consumer of hospital services you kind

146
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,859
of have an expectation of something

147
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,850
right like you expect them to be some

148
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,940
some modicum of reasonably secure so how

149
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:21,130
could we verify that what would you do

150
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,260
for compliance to verify for your own

151
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,030
personal like a satisfaction that their

152
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,200
that their that the risk has introduced

153
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,330
an acceptable level because that's what

154
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,780
security really is right not secure it's

155
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:33,190
is the risk and acceptable level so what

156
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,900
I think the goals and might and this is

157
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,419
my interpretation you can please if you

158
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,320
have any other things you would say

159
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,719
compliance really means to you and in a

160
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,669
perfect world is a minimum standard that

161
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,400
we can judge everyone by right I want to

162
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:46,780
know out there there's four six four

163
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,729
hospitals out there I'm getting ready to

164
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,710
go get my heart surgery done on one of

165
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:52,270
them happens to have been hit by malware

166
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:56,070
four times in the last three months and

167
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:58,090
the guy the head of IT says that

168
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:01,120
cybersecurity is an a real thing

169
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:05,140
he's a cybersecurity denier the first

170
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,460
right so am I gonna go there or am I

171
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,130
gonna go these other people who have

172
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,930
some type of verifiable verifiable

173
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,030
cybersecurity compliance in place so

174
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,680
it's a way to evaluate that that that

175
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,140
security against the common standard and

176
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,669
this is where everyone gets frustrated

177
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,080
with compliance is because it's hey we

178
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,940
got these rules out here and they're all

179
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,349
on the list and it's the first thing

180
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,550
everyone does why do you have that one

181
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,500
there why don't you have this one there

182
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,270
why is that rule over this one why is

183
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,580
this not a minimum baseline so there's a

184
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:33,400
lot of arguing the internet is not in

185
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:36,729
any way facilitation for arguments is it

186
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,349
no it's just unicorns and stuff so

187
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,760
though it's a way to demonstrate the

188
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,890
work that you put in by your security

189
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,330
team in reality right so we're all we're

190
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,770
all trying to do good work we're trying

191
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,130
to make our organizations more secure

192
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:50,049
but this allows us to show progress on

193
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,540
that front so going back to that

194
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,780
question of are we secure

195
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,950
it's hard to answer that without some

196
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,780
independently verifiable standard it is

197
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,159
really hard for us to say hey yes I feel

198
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,049
like we're measurably more secure or

199
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,180
that we have a standard of security in

200
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,310
place that reduces the risk to where

201
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,140
it's acceptable and then it's a great

202
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,330
funding negotiation tacking now one of

203
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,710
another thing about us as people who

204
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,900
like to do engineering casas we're not

205
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:16,960
very good at negotiating with management

206
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,000
for things like funding so we like to

207
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,609
say hey I need this because this right

208
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,600
so I have I need this technical solution

209
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,770
because of this technical problem

210
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,180
instead of instead of stating and in

211
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,070
terms like I need this technical

212
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,600
solution because this problem which

213
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,790
affects the business like this but

214
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,200
compliance everyone most of your

215
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,490
managers have heard these buzzwords and

216
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,560
there's all different types of

217
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,210
compliance now especially since Enron

218
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,510
there's lots of organizational

219
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:41,859
compliance but they in reality they

220
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,969
understand the compliance frameworks

221
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,860
much better than they will be an

222
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,150
engineering task so and then finally

223
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,980
it's my favorite without it people just

224
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,179
make up random junk they're people

225
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,220
either really just could not care less

226
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,600
about actually securing the things that

227
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,040
they're supposed to protect and that's

228
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,810
the reality of it and we'll see some

229
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,030
more of that in some of the DoD

230
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,740
contractors responses to what the DoD

231
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,210
tried to do but I mean we all we all

232
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,140
want to assume the best of people we all

233
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,909
want to assume that everyone's out there

234
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,770
trying to do the best that they can to

235
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,600
secure their environments but sometimes

236
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:12,849
that's not the case I'm gonna need a

237
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:16,210
drink here okay so why we hate

238
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:18,100
compliance well first of all first of

239
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,810
all it does not simply stop attackers

240
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,690
which is the things our bosses get right

241
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:24,760
we're compliant how do we get hacked you

242
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,170
have to be an idiot because I clearly

243
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,030
checked the boxes that we were compliant

244
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,930
we got hacked therefore just but it

245
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,669
doesn't work like that right

246
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,799
compliance is simply not a panacea to

247
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,750
stopping attacks it often has really

248
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,640
stupid rules in it which we as technical

249
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,950
people can see and we get to argue with

250
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,039
non-technical auditors about why they're

251
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:44,680
not right and we often we are right and

252
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,790
they don't understand it so and then how

253
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,880
many of you like putting those little

254
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,290
banners on your workstations and in some

255
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,040
systems especially now that when you're

256
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,150
trying to follow that now in the

257
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,250
applications that can be just a real

258
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,900
pain to try to get the banners so when a

259
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,120
user logs in they're presented with a

260
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,340
consent banner I will not do anything

261
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,470
bad I understand that I may be monitored

262
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,060
etc etc etc but just for those little

263
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,310
things like that are just annoying right

264
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,770
so it's abstract often they're just

265
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,089
information in these standards that we

266
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,410
know have an idea of what they're

267
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,630
talking about but not really what they

268
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:15,040
want which means that no matter what we

269
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,080
do the auditors come in and can come in

270
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,880
and just wreck us they say okay hey you

271
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,920
didn't you did this but I believe that

272
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,830
in Latin this word means something else

273
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,020
so therefore you're now not in compliant

274
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,760
and you get dinged for that and they're

275
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:30,610
and they were never meant to promote

276
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,140
building a program so what we should be

277
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,760
trying to do is build repeatable

278
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,620
security processes for our organization

279
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,120
that results in a program that we can

280
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,510
repeat right even even if we're not

281
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,960
there but what compliance is not meant

282
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,480
to do that

283
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,490
finally and this is a tough one how many

284
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,279
how many compliance cartoons you see

285
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,290
with the guy in the hoodie they're just

286
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:51,970
they're just there's no sexy factor to

287
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,860
compliance there isn't you can't get it

288
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,029
out there yeah I mean you can try I

289
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,589
think we can maybe have like a

290
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,490
remarketing branding campaign for

291
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:59,260
compliance you will put them in

292
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,820
somebody's State sitting with some

293
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,160
documents and then some erasers and

294
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,110
whiteout maybe no probably not

295
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,130
and then finally it's not scalable and

296
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,870
this is just kind of the death knell for

297
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,060
most of the compliance standards that

298
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:13,360
I've worked with they simply have a a

299
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:15,760
check in the box point in time line in

300
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,150
the sand for where your state of

301
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,470
security was with movement of thought or

302
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,600
consideration for the future right and

303
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,220
you used to do this all the time and

304
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,690
they've understood the error of their

305
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,770
ways and kind of try to fix that process

306
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,630
but they had this thing called diet cap

307
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,710
which they would say okay we're going to

308
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,540
accredit the system we're gonna do all

309
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,890
the security stuff you guys got to pull

310
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,959
up all your vulnerability to show it to

311
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,699
us submit it in this big documentation

312
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,010
package and then they wouldn't look at

313
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,890
that security of the system for three

314
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:44,410
years which is basically basically like

315
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,520
three million years in IT security right

316
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,260
so they wouldn't look they would not

317
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,460
evaluate or check on that one that the

318
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,069
system security again for three years

319
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,620
this doesn't work so then why do they

320
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:56,110
fail so how many of you how many of you

321
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,430
ever been dropped in and hopefully this

322
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,660
didn't happen to you said please don't

323
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,339
feel bad for not participating but if

324
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,050
you have how many of you have been

325
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:04,959
dropped into an organization that has

326
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:07,689
absolutely no security practices or

327
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,510
procedures or policies period like

328
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:11,680
there's like hey great okay we heard we

329
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,120
heard we need security so we're gonna

330
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,939
hire someone to do security rating that

331
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,850
fun because you just get dropped in it's

332
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,320
like you're the only guy in Vietnam

333
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,360
against the entire

334
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,430
see army right you know where to start

335
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,990
but tough popping out of foxholes over

336
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,420
the place you can't even answer you came

337
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,620
and answer all the spam requests issues

338
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,689
that you get must start on the

339
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,100
compliance effort but so these

340
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,360
compliance frameworks are massive and

341
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,830
they really seem insurmountable there's

342
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,930
not there's nothing that can sit you can

343
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:40,210
say okay here's the tiny little bit that

344
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,979
you gotta do first and then there's how

345
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,450
you build up the compliance and they're

346
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,760
usually an all-or-nothing approach so

347
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:47,650
you either are compliant and your boss

348
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,980
likes you or you're not compliant and

349
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:52,000
your boss hates you and then once again

350
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,680
there's a lot of times they're simply

351
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,910
fake so what are we supposed to do we're

352
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,060
supposed to be when the boss comes out

353
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,860
and says when the boss comes out and

354
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,030
says hey we need to be compliant what

355
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,220
are you supposed to do get this

356
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,980
compliant right so when the auditors

357
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,870
come out and you had through no fault of

358
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,430
your own 47 thousand other things to do

359
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,890
the boss gave you no time no resource no

360
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,849
no resources no funding nothing what are

361
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,199
you gonna do you're gonna write a really

362
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,250
good explanation of why you are

363
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,140
compliant even though you know you're

364
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,710
probably not into that little box that

365
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,850
says here's here's how we do X right

366
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:23,500
that's what happens we're trying to

367
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,760
present the best our best foot forward

368
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,740
as an organization we don't open

369
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,960
ourselves up to vulnerabilities but how

370
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,460
much does that increase our security not

371
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,750
at all right because we first of all

372
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,730
we've demonstrated because because net

373
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,900
then the next week we asked for funny

374
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,150
and well you just said we were we were

375
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:40,630
good on this right we were compliant so

376
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:42,220
we checked the box so simply faked just

377
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,350
because of that's how the business goes

378
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,850
and often your managers will be aware of

379
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,680
this and I already talked about the

380
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:52,830
point in time and not not our people so

381
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:55,870
I worked on the network let's see here

382
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:58,000
it was for DoD system and it was for

383
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,880
some like disconnected air gap thing

384
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,730
inside some bunker inside another bunker

385
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,890
and it was one laptop right and the cost

386
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,970
for this laptop to be accredited cousin

387
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,050
deity you have to have a credit at any

388
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,850
system that's gonna be owned in any

389
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,890
network even if it's not gonna be on a

390
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,420
network it's gonna be air-gap had to

391
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,760
accredit the system so this is the

392
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,500
actual costs in labor for accrediting

393
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,030
the single laptop that was gonna do one

394
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,460
thing and run one piece of software

395
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,780
I'm gonna take a guess some of you

396
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:26,260
probably will beat me because you've

397
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:30,069
been in DoD before $75,000 so the

398
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:31,900
paperwork 75,000 that feels pretty good

399
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,070
your taxpayer dollars but that was the

400
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,329
process right it had to go through all

401
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,740
the

402
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,420
all the checks all the compliance checks

403
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,649
everything had to be done and then the

404
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,180
other thing that would kind of proves in

405
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:40,380
that scalable portion is we heard a

406
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,550
little bit yesterday about the hip-hip

407
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,830
alliance if you're if you're a small

408
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,689
business maybe providing want some small

409
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,680
service to a hospital maybe you're an

410
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:50,459
h-back person

411
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,540
those guys are popular with target so if

412
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,890
you're providing one small service and

413
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,420
you get hit with a 15k fine what does

414
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,819
that do to you that's pretty big deal

415
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,649
right but I mean if a hospital gets hit

416
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,750
with 15k fine it's not a big do it all

417
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:02,930
so the frameworks often are simply not

418
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,310
scalable we're meant to be scaled at all

419
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:08,430
all right

420
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:13,649
so is compliance necessary what do y'all

421
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:16,829
think yeah I mean it it it certainly

422
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:18,600
feels like it right I mean so so why and

423
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:21,060
I think that my reason is the first one

424
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,040
do we get security done and I'm not

425
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,750
saying done finished I'm saying do we do

426
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,910
we get work done completed on security

427
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,220
without some type of external motivator

428
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:32,010
so I think that even internally

429
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,890
motivated compliance or an internal goal

430
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:37,189
to which the teams held is a great

431
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:40,560
metric or a great motivator for

432
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:42,089
compliance and I personally think that I

433
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,410
don't think we can continue to move

434
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,870
forward as organizations without

435
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,310
requiring ourselves to be held to some

436
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,450
type of sets of compliance standard oh

437
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,130
you got to do something you got to say

438
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,329
hey this is where we're going even if

439
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,170
it's even as some you make up if you

440
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:55,770
want to go make your own compliance

441
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:57,719
standards up like Billy Bob's 4755

442
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,319
compliance standard you can write your

443
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,550
own little certs

444
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,410
give yourself a gold stamp when you get

445
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,910
it but yet like put a map out there

446
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,260
right this is where we're going because

447
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,029
often we just end up doing day-to-day

448
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,209
stuff we never focus on where we're

449
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:10,410
going so Newton's second law everyone's

450
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:12,420
everyone wants to talk about Newton's

451
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,850
first law but Newton's second law always

452
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:18,209
gets left out so there's got to be

453
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:20,459
something that forces that change right

454
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:22,469
it has power behind it it has some

455
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:24,180
motivator behind it so some other great

456
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,980
standards and I'm saying I say great I'm

457
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,149
being facetious but he's somebody's are

458
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,320
gonna stand up so we've heard a lot of

459
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:29,399
them now you can think you can think

460
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,410
about probably the motivation behind

461
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,990
each of these just by looking at a PCI

462
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,279
DSS payment card industry we're talking

463
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,860
about processing payments securing

464
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,050
credit card transactions HIPPA health

465
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,570
insurance your health records is our

466
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:46,229
27001 is anyone else bothered by the

467
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:47,160
fact that is oh the name write ISO you

468
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,569
would think that state

469
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,790
for something cou this is this is this

470
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:52,378
is a standard body it's international

471
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,800
I'm sorry international organization of

472
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:57,000
standards the acronym is ISO I really

473
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,378
can't we came and get together on that

474
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,660
sorry this is that beep said GDP our GDP

475
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:04,800
our we're all pretty familiar with that

476
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,850
okay so these are some of the other

477
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,378
stands that we've talked about that you

478
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,420
some of you have either seen in the news

479
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:11,490
or been a part of implementing or trying

480
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:15,750
to get to so next we're going to kind of

481
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:17,759
jump into a segue for what CN MC is so

482
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,170
first we're gonna start with us getting

483
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,050
rekt by every other every other country

484
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:23,490
in the world on cybersecurity so alright

485
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:26,069
we'll set the stage here we're gonna do

486
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:29,879
a little timeline of wreckage for the

487
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:31,560
United States so sometime around 2006

488
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:32,970
and this is just when the United States

489
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,040
started notice it started noticing these

490
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:39,870
things the Chinese just started

491
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:41,339
exfilling data at massive rates now I'm

492
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,129
gonna focus on a couple of a couple of

493
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:46,009
these aspects which are the fighter

494
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:48,779
programs because they're kind of the

495
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:50,370
they're bees and billions attached to

496
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,540
the research and development that went

497
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,800
into them and there's there are some

498
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,019
good news articles out there that you

499
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,339
can find the gloves are unclassified and

500
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:59,339
you can see a lot of that you can

501
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:01,110
actually see go find some top-secret

502
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:02,579
classified slides that are on the

503
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,230
internet that you can go peruse at your

504
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:08,819
leisure now if you have a clearance that

505
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:12,120
they're not released anyway so how the

506
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:15,329
United States helped steal help China

507
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:18,089
steal the f-22 and f-35 so in 2006 the

508
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:19,678
Chinese infiltrated a defense contractor

509
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:22,678
and stole a bunch of plans schematics

510
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,750
different engine details information

511
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,600
about the new HUDs heads-up displays and

512
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,490
in these aircraft so it wasn't until

513
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,570
2009 of course because we're really good

514
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,490
at letting people in our networks for a

515
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,860
very long time that we figured out that

516
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:37,470
the Chinese had performed this theft now

517
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,908
finally in 2013 people started saying ok

518
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,720
hey this is this seems like this is a

519
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:41,610
little bigger than what we initially

520
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,929
reported which was like hey we lost a

521
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:46,820
couple documents don't worry about it

522
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:49,380
they were unclassified nobody deal so ok

523
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,250
after that and I really want to

524
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,190
demonstrate here is if we're talking

525
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:55,470
about 2006 everything gets stolen 2020

526
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,940
the first real measure of actual

527
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,559
compliance requirements from the US

528
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,120
government so we're pretty fast so we're

529
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,870
nimble we're nimble as a US government

530
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,389
right

531
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,158
so in 2017 we had that we had to kind of

532
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,770
the hey guys we got to do better at

533
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:08,610
cybersecurity we can't keep losing

534
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,350
billions of dollars worth of information

535
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,969
to the Chinese and Secretary of State

536
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,918
Warner talk about the yesterday they

537
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,470
really focus on they focus it heavily on

538
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,559
economic espionage and basically doing

539
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:21,480
what some people would say Microsoft

540
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:24,450
does and goes it goes out and takes it

541
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,900
now barely kidding no um but so the

542
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:29,460
Chinese go steal information to better

543
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,940
their own research with rather than

544
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,049
doing their own research so so the next

545
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,880
slide will show you kind of result of

546
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:39,980
that so the United States released the

547
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:42,120
f-35 the Chinese release the j-31

548
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,279
striking simulate Sim Sim you while

549
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,260
striking similarities in these aircraft

550
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:48,860
right so I like to keep the key point

551
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,640
here china is the world's leader in

552
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,129
stealing and reverse engineering other

553
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,299
countries products now the other the

554
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,740
second quarters from a different article

555
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:59,309
talking about Chinese China's economic

556
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:01,380
development and the dances in research

557
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:02,460
in aerospace right they're making a lot

558
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,590
of progress in developing their

559
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,590
aerospace industry

560
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:10,139
good job China doing great here now so

561
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,699
so there's I'm not an airplane guy but

562
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,120
apparently there are a pile of in terms

563
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,799
of the rate at which this plane can

564
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,299
accelerate all the metrics that you look

565
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,340
at in planes are very similar in fact

566
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:22,168
too similar and that and the fact that

567
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,189
they verified that these were in Chinese

568
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:25,649
the documents weren't the design

569
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,850
documents were in Chinese hands they

570
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:28,590
ripped off a lot of it

571
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,559
now this plane has been our development

572
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:33,809
since I think like 1995 or something so

573
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:36,960
for us it took us like 20 years China

574
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:41,299
did in like five like one-tenth the cost

575
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:44,190
I mean and so I was at briefing by I

576
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:45,809
think the thing was Carl rags rags rags

577
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,159
Dale rags was his nickname these type

578
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,139
talks about how America we will

579
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:50,669
continually out-innovate everybody right

580
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,350
but then he's like well we can't

581
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:54,120
out-innovate it when they steal our

582
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,980
innovation right we gotta secure it so

583
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,918
that's the motivation so okay so yeah

584
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,080
round number two year so that's the f-35

585
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,520
and the j-31

586
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,039
and we have the f-22 Raptor which is a

587
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,700
new stealth fighter and then so China

588
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,230
has the j-20 mighty dragon any similar

589
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,700
to pologize to the poor-quality the

590
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,230
image on the right was the best shot I

591
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,500
could get of that profile and it is

592
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,000
photoshopped onto a Wii

593
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,030
but that's a real photo of it it's from

594
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,150
a China propaganda video good stuff but

595
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:23,980
you can see it's coming it could be a

596
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:26,830
similar aircraft just throwing that out

597
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:29,740
there right so the cumulative cost of

598
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:32,080
Chinese espionage may reach 600 billion

599
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:36,070
with the B dollars in the next several

600
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,539
years over the last twenty two decades

601
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,639
ever that's you do two decades that and

602
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:41,200
so in total that cost will reach 600 600

603
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,530
billion the next few years so so what's

604
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,690
the DoD well the DoD says well hey

605
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:48,668
contractors and anyone doing business

606
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,750
with us we're going to get together and

607
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:52,210
we're going to talk about this a little

608
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,820
bit right so you guys have been losing

609
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:56,140
some data so what we'd like to do and

610
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,610
this is the mom moment right where you

611
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,429
tell your kid I'm gonna count the three

612
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:02,139
every time you get the two right

613
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:04,059
everyone ever not gotten two three or

614
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,200
two I mean they never do it at one it

615
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:06,970
doesn't work right so anyway the deity

616
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,809
is like hey what we would really like

617
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:12,190
you to do keep emphasis on like is

618
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:13,389
implement these security controls right

619
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,100
we want you to go back to your

620
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:17,710
organization's put these controls in

621
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,750
place and become compliant now the key

622
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,710
here is we're not going to check you

623
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,970
because we think that's just a little

624
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,320
too much burden on you so we're just

625
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,880
going to please just tell us that you

626
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,039
did them come back tell us what you did

627
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,600
tell us what you didn't do document that

628
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,280
a nice little document a little poem a

629
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,629
plan of action for how you gonna fix

630
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,610
them just didn't get that back to us

631
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:37,929
right so how do you think that worked

632
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:40,600
tell us you did it hmm not very well

633
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,950
so independent on it right so okay of

634
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,168
course everyone's compliant with this

635
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,100
because you just got it's kind of I

636
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,900
don't know if y'all ever heard Jeff

637
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,379
Foxworthy he would say but he said he

638
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,940
says the repo guy comes to take his car

639
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,169
so the bank guys there to take his car

640
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,730
and the cars like he's like way taking

641
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:56,559
my car man he's like well always like

642
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,230
you to make payment can I make a payment

643
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:01,510
now he's like yeah well you can do cash

644
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,679
or check and just like we'll check I

645
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,350
thought you wanted money yeah I'll write

646
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:07,450
you a check right now right so this is

647
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,678
kind of like the yes this 871 compliance

648
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,970
thing sure you hadn't compliance I can

649
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:12,220
write your compliance right now would

650
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:15,070
say which they did in an independent

651
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:18,460
review however 90% of the contractors

652
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:20,379
failed the audit now what stuff here is

653
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,539
they feel like I'm pretty pretty simple

654
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,429
stuff it wasn't like hey I can detect a

655
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:26,530
PT's within 30 seconds and have them off

656
00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:27,940
my network was it wasn't stuff like that

657
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,269
it was pretty simple stuff which we'll

658
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,519
get into

659
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:31,719
a little bit later bit so he they

660
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:34,119
recommended hey maybe we should actually

661
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:35,799
check this I mean but he I guess I

662
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,089
wonder who common sense checks these

663
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:38,440
guys before they publish you standards

664
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,389
and says you know what we're going to

665
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,820
trust you guys to do this and you're

666
00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:44,439
gonna do it is there anyone in here that

667
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,789
would think that that's gonna work like

668
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,339
in reality I we have millions on the

669
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:50,320
line now I'm gonna say I didn't meet it

670
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:53,139
and nothing that's gonna happen right so

671
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,119
and then of course they were surprised

672
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:57,428
that despite the company's best

673
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:59,468
intentions they were likely to over rate

674
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:01,929
then under rate their performance

675
00:22:59,469 --> 00:23:03,879
shocked I mean let's get our best shock

676
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:04,959
faces out for that one so the amp no

677
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:07,839
more two is a little more safe because

678
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:10,479
that that was a general sampling the dod

679
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:12,639
IG just picked I think it was a small

680
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:14,950
sample size they picked several sampling

681
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:16,869
of contractors with with contracts over

682
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,089
$1,000,000 for the DoD and did that

683
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:20,468
study so it could mean maybe not very

684
00:23:19,089 --> 00:23:23,289
critical programs okay let's look at the

685
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:25,899
next one the missile defense agency I

686
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:27,959
mean it seemed like a big deal I don't

687
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:30,549
know I mean rockets firing into the air

688
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:33,549
saving us from other inter ballistic

689
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:36,789
missiles coming at us and hope it says

690
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:38,679
here rely on the system to protect the

691
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:40,899
United States are forward deployed

692
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:43,419
forces our friends and allies from

693
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:44,738
hostile ballistic missile attack sounds

694
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:46,329
sounds important right so you would

695
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:49,389
think the contractor is supporting this

696
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:50,499
like when they self attested they did

697
00:23:49,389 --> 00:23:51,668
all the right things right they sure

698
00:23:50,499 --> 00:23:53,709
didn't write this down and say okay you

699
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:55,209
know what I mean if someone hacks into a

700
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:56,619
missile system probably not a big deal

701
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:58,299
that our s response is delayed by 10

702
00:23:56,619 --> 00:24:02,049
minutes because ransomware is hog on the

703
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:03,999
machine dope and I never wrote any one

704
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:04,719
see the chucktesta videos nope

705
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:05,739
chucktesta

706
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:09,129
you probably thought you're gonna get

707
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:10,389
cyber security no you did not so they

708
00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:11,889
did not hear the security practice so

709
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:12,849
what were some of those practices and

710
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:15,218
this is at the missile defense agency

711
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:17,079
let's look at these we've never seen

712
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:18,579
these before right they don't use a

713
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:20,799
multi-factor Wow

714
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:21,639
it isn't it I mean I'm sure some of

715
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,979
you've been in this industry a lot

716
00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:25,389
longer than I have but you kind of get

717
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:27,399
this feeling that someone somewhere out

718
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:29,408
there is really doing these things right

719
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,099
right people are really taking their job

720
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:31,509
seriously

721
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:33,249
and they're getting this and then you

722
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:36,789
see stuff like this like missile defense

723
00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:39,489
agency still not using multi-factor

724
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:41,950
little or to default passwords was

725
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:45,279
mentioned no password

726
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:46,299
plexy required no risk no scanning

727
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,350
ordered identification of

728
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:53,100
vulnerabilities it's a missile system so

729
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:55,330
good stuff right so he's like okay

730
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:58,629
clearly we can do this this is going to

731
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:00,370
bring us around to CMMC so we obviously

732
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:02,710
cannot trust people to tell us that

733
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:05,739
they're doing cybersecurity going back

734
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:11,799
to our point about what gets measured

735
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:12,340
he's gonna get done so now they get

736
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:14,590
serious

737
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:17,408
so the UT says okay you know what

738
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:19,510
clearly this didn't work we tried to be

739
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:20,919
the good cop didn't work out very well

740
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,990
we wasted two years so I'm telling

741
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,190
people to get done and they didn't well

742
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:26,289
they said they were and then they they

743
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,760
weren't so now they said you know what

744
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:30,490
we're not even gonna let you compete for

745
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,340
federal or DoD currently for DoD work

746
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,480
unless you are compliant and it was like

747
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,850
ah okay we're just got to be compliant

748
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,330
as verified by a third-party Assessor oh

749
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:40,029
crap

750
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:41,379
right here's the shocked face now there

751
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:42,880
was a lot of complaining about this so

752
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,440
you can't make us do this and then I

753
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,720
guess the funny response that I thought

754
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,549
was from the DoD night I think so Katie

755
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,690
Arrington is kind of ahead of this and I

756
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:51,010
can't remember lady that I'm talking

757
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,210
about but she's one of the people who

758
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,889
goes out and talks about this on the

759
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,450
stage she's like what do you mean this

760
00:25:53,889 --> 00:25:59,860
is difficult you said you've already

761
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:01,779
done ooh what do you say there oh crap

762
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,189
oh yes okay so there was a lot of

763
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:04,840
complaining this is too stringent too

764
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,419
hard you're now gonna require us to do

765
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:10,809
this well we required a W before but I'm

766
00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:12,970
handling keyboard liars shocked again so

767
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:14,200
the beauty got very serious about this

768
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,460
and this is a big deal

769
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,279
I mean think about not being able to

770
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,659
compete for federal or DoD contracting

771
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:21,159
work when that's your entire line of

772
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:22,450
business and especially if you're a

773
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:23,740
larger organization and you lied on that

774
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,149
initial assessment now you're screwed

775
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,169
because you got a pile of work to do

776
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:30,340
with the pile of things that make up in

777
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:32,409
a short amount of time so now well not

778
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,360
another side note this is at a regional

779
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:35,350
level this this is gonna this is going

780
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,820
to cause problems for small and

781
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,830
medium-sized businesses it really is

782
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,570
because it's gonna be difficult to meet

783
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,559
these compliance standards especially if

784
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:43,299
you haven't been paying attention to

785
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:45,100
this in a short amount of time in it

786
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:47,820
like even further to bring it kind of

787
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,870
home here to West Virginia is that

788
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,549
economically disadvantaged the areas are

789
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:53,678
gonna have significantly more problems

790
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:55,539
getting these things in place especially

791
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,880
they don't have advanced knowledge all

792
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:59,150
right so

793
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,039
so if we as West Virginia look to the

794
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,660
DoD as a funding source or we're gonna

795
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:06,470
continue in DoD contract and oh that

796
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:07,910
think TMC solutions is does a lot of

797
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:10,669
confederal contractor work out of

798
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:11,720
Fairmont that's one of the people people

799
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:12,740
that came to mind it's a great success

800
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,820
story for West Virginia they're doing

801
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,770
that doing a good job of winning new

802
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,000
work but this affects them right so we

803
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:18,668
got it we have to be able to support

804
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,010
these businesses in in these efforts

805
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:24,020
however so that so what does seems CMMC

806
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:25,970
help or how does it help with any of

807
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,559
this so we've talked a lot about the

808
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,960
background so we now know Russians steel

809
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:30,950
everything Chinese steel everything

810
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,080
Russians are messing with our elections

811
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:35,690
as we talked about that yesterday and

812
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,010
mr. Warner stock and people can't be

813
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,350
trusted to cybersecurity by themselves

814
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,789
so whether the DoD said okay well we

815
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,990
can't just abandon all those small

816
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:43,429
businesses and all those peoples what

817
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,080
we're going to try to do is make a model

818
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:46,850
very similar to the seem in my model for

819
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,428
development operations that is

820
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:50,840
approachable so going back to that

821
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:51,890
situation where you get dropped in and

822
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,360
you got compliance on day one you have

823
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:56,809
no idea where to start so the DoD is

824
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,580
said okay instead of actually requiring

825
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:59,720
this entire massive list of things we're

826
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,580
going to actually give you a framework

827
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,270
you can start at a small level or a

828
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:07,699
lower level and then move up in maturity

829
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:09,440
so you can say okay here's level one

830
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:12,500
things I need to do and you can move

831
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,419
forward without with different levels as

832
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,929
your processes mature so it's well

833
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:16,940
supported

834
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:19,340
so I mean every one in there and there

835
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,809
brother I feel like has had input on the

836
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,760
Stanford I'm a thousand questions or

837
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:25,309
input they head back on feedback to the

838
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,408
thing or to the response for questions

839
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:29,780
it will have an Assessor body so you can

840
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:31,340
be independently verified it includes

841
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,960
maturity models which as I said can help

842
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,030
you map your program to a long-term goal

843
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,039
to me and finally the levels help build

844
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:39,309
buy-in so going back to how in our

845
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:42,230
day-to-day jobs what do we need a lot of

846
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:43,879
if we're gonna get things done our

847
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,710
management support and buy-in right so

848
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,500
how do we do that so they're always

849
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:49,669
asking us for plans right tell me what's

850
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,690
the next thing where is this gonna do

851
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:52,059
what's this gonna do next or what's it

852
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,530
what's your three to five year play well

853
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:56,658
you can use CMMC for that you can say

854
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:58,010
okay here's my three to five-year plan

855
00:28:56,659 --> 00:28:59,450
I'm gonna use I'm going to use this

856
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,700
maturity model to say okay here's we're

857
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,990
at step two here's where we're gonna be

858
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,610
step three here's where we're going to

859
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:07,100
be and if we choose to we're gonna go on

860
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,870
the step step four and five okay so

861
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,419
those levels help build buy-in so that's

862
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:13,729
where that's why I see

863
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:16,250
CMMC as a different type of compliance

864
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:17,750
model and then finally it's scalable so

865
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,100
it's size appropriate so going back to

866
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,410
the small businesses if they're paying

867
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,879
attention to this this is doable because

868
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,290
you can get in here you can do the

869
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,490
things that you need to do for your just

870
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:28,610
no matter the size of your organization

871
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:30,590
in time to still be able to do business

872
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:33,560
and actually increase the security of

873
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:36,020
your team all right so another cool

874
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,580
thing about CMC is it incorporates best

875
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,350
practices from everywhere so this is

876
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,060
this is the best pet this is the

877
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:43,939
different cyber security standards that

878
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:45,649
are a reference or a part of this so we

879
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,240
got I mean there's the Australian best

880
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,160
practices and I'm a few all any of you

881
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,080
follow the sans 20 critical controls

882
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,430
talk too many critical controls but that

883
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,460
was pretty heavily based off of some

884
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:57,500
Australian I can remember their team's

885
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,790
name but it security research on what

886
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,320
basically what is the most effective

887
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,879
thing to implement right what what do we

888
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,189
actually do to reduce risk so there's a

889
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:07,370
reference add the reference PCI DSS the

890
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:09,110
HIPAA Security rules you see the CFR

891
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:13,040
stuff obviously the encryption standards

892
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:14,689
but they consulted a very broad set of

893
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,220
standards to bring together something

894
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,870
that kind of represents all those things

895
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,580
and that you can map back to those

896
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,290
standards when you're actually asked to

897
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:25,070
do a compliance check for something else

898
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:26,600
so the framework itself so good for best

899
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:28,520
practices though let's let's let's talk

900
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,719
about it some of the frustrating things

901
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:33,800
about compliance well we don't really

902
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,480
how many of you had to have gotten one

903
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:38,090
of the big spreadsheets ahead to fill it

904
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,160
out so you say they say okay here's our

905
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:42,050
compliance spreadsheet there's a list of

906
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,420
these controls and you have to tell us

907
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:45,260
what we do right well what I mean

908
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,970
there's a lot there's so many questions

909
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:49,820
you have right what at what level does

910
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:51,230
this apply like to which hosts are we

911
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,550
talking like applications I mean one of

912
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:56,210
the things that always one of my

913
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:57,379
favorite things about interpretations of

914
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,550
compliance then there was multi-factor

915
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,920
authentication because we used to do

916
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:02,720
some audits of different I mean

917
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:05,480
including critical infrastructure and

918
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,520
they would say well we do mod effector

919
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,380
like okay we've been on the network for

920
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,320
two weeks we haven't seen a single

921
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:15,050
second token required anywhere well we

922
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,750
have to badge into the building that's

923
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:19,190
multi-factor authentication right so but

924
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,440
but the interpretation of these things

925
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:22,610
are just so varied right when you have

926
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,080
these broad standards that don't

927
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,090
necessarily apply or

928
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,770
don't consult outside standards but CMC

929
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:29,919
attempts to fix that by bringing in

930
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:32,330
feedback from across these standards to

931
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:36,490
build I guess one standard to rule them

932
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:36,490
all so I got got behind my notes here

933
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:42,950
all right so so it's the buy it so CMC

934
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:46,960
divides the best practices into these

935
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:49,430
domains so you have these sets of

936
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,840
capabilities for cyber security which

937
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:53,210
then translate down to practice

938
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,070
practices and processes which are each

939
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:56,330
defined at a different maturity level so

940
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,500
we've got different domains we're all

941
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:59,330
probably all familiar with like if I say

942
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,610
access control you've got an idea user

943
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:04,939
access management if I say media

944
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:06,639
protection you get an idea I'm my policy

945
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:09,470
says allow everyone to put their USBs

946
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,700
into the computers right well isn't it

947
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,260
great though and so the DoD come out

948
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,760
with that they're like hey we got to

949
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,640
stop this you can't put us busy and we

950
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,220
had we we had we traced a significant

951
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,840
breach to the USB well what was their

952
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,280
final resolution on that you like to

953
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:27,439
stop us from being plugged in and I

954
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:31,220
remember super glue super glue in the

955
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,020
USB port because I mean someone some

956
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,390
idiot is gonna still plug that stupid

957
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,920
USB in right so that was that was that

958
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:38,180
was the in the Pentagon at least I

959
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,410
should say in the Pentagon that's what

960
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,420
they did they just superglue it was like

961
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,040
hey I can't remember the acronym

962
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,240
portable is pretty funny but it that was

963
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,340
the goal right that's USB that's

964
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,520
technology at its best we couldn't stop

965
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,510
it technologically so um so it really

966
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,400
breaks it down to you you have the

967
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,660
different domains or areas in which you

968
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,010
need to focus then you have the

969
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,930
capabilities within those amazed or what

970
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:58,190
what do I need to be able to do and then

971
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:59,930
finally what are the practices

972
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:02,870
technically administrative Lee in the

973
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:04,730
processes that I need to have instituted

974
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:07,340
or AM implanted in my organization to

975
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,930
meet that objective now what really once

976
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,970
again shines through for CMC is the fact

977
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:15,260
that you have different levels so in

978
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:17,780
following with CMC cnmi you move upwards

979
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:20,960
in levels of maturity as you achieve

980
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,280
better process better Duquette I'm sorry

981
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,990
I'm smiling cuz I know this is this has

982
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,090
to hurt better process and documentation

983
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,770
right so you get you as you get better

984
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,179
at these things but automation is one of

985
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:30,440
the keys here right as you better at

986
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,540
these things you move up in the maturity

987
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,380
model so the level one is basic cyber

988
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,850
security hygiene

989
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,280
brushing your teeth once a week right

990
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:38,029
that's the basic stuff right hopefully

991
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,029
hopefully

992
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:42,830
until you're 25 then you have processes

993
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:45,289
at that level which are just means

994
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:48,109
they're performed so I brush my teeth

995
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:49,158
once every week that's that's the basic

996
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:52,460
stuff then yeah then you have to

997
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:54,379
document it to be the second level

998
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,849
process you have to document but but you

999
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:58,849
can see pretty clearly how this how the

1000
00:33:55,849 --> 00:34:00,918
scale so you can you can be both at a

1001
00:33:58,849 --> 00:34:02,210
different level on the practice side so

1002
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:03,979
the things sort of server example oh

1003
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:06,619
what what are we doing capability wise

1004
00:34:03,979 --> 00:34:07,909
and at what level what could we stop

1005
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:09,348
that's I guess that's the question I

1006
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:11,210
asked of it so what could we stop

1007
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:12,859
capability wise and then how well is

1008
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,480
that optimized so you might have someone

1009
00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:16,909
who's a brilliant threat hunter on your

1010
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,719
team and you know that if you turn them

1011
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:19,609
loose on the network they're gonna

1012
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:20,899
figure out who's on there or someone is

1013
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:22,969
on there and they're gonna be able to do

1014
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:25,159
a very good forensic analysis and give

1015
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:27,109
you a report of that that's that one guy

1016
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:29,089
right that's not a repeatable process

1017
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:30,918
that your organization can support

1018
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:35,418
Indonesia Mario you're screwed Ian you

1019
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:37,308
can't do anything so this helps to

1020
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:39,469
define and reduce that organization risk

1021
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:42,470
by requiring you to mature your own

1022
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:45,759
processes so that you can do it or you

1023
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:50,138
know what you can do as an organization

1024
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:53,359
all right so the different model domains

1025
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:55,760
ask access control asset management

1026
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,078
other than accountability awareness and

1027
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,039
training configuration management not

1028
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:59,690
and you guys move through the rest of it

1029
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:01,220
I guess the question I would have is you

1030
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,140
read through these is there anything

1031
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,939
there you would say this doesn't belong

1032
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:08,240
here or this does not make me any more

1033
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,710
secure that for me I think the answer

1034
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,549
was no I think each of these things has

1035
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:15,829
value inner security program it reduces

1036
00:35:13,549 --> 00:35:17,839
the risk now we had a little bit of a

1037
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:19,910
discussion yesterday with someone on

1038
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,880
LinkedIn about Windows Defender

1039
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:26,750
so they said I think the comment was

1040
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,940
lmao I I have Windows Defender I don't

1041
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:31,010
need an AV now I mean Windows offenders

1042
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,450
got had taken its it hits over the years

1043
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:34,250
but it I mean recently it's kind of

1044
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:35,450
gotten it so it has got much better than

1045
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:39,799
it actually and actually outperformed

1046
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:40,730
some of the paid versions that performed

1047
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:43,009
some of the paid version of and of

1048
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:48,079
Ireson and multiple been drug vendor

1049
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:49,640
agnostic tests so is it a panacea no you

1050
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,710
cannot trust your antivirus to keep you

1051
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,540
safe from acts anyone with

1052
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:56,890
any type of maturity and a threat level

1053
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:59,300
but it doesn't reduce your risk yes

1054
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:01,190
right so none of these things are meant

1055
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,630
to be hey this is this is it this is the

1056
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,800
one this is the button you push and

1057
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,990
that's why we keep buying all these

1058
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,160
really expensive tools and spend on all

1059
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:09,229
this really expensive research dollars

1060
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,399
and figuring out the next next-gen

1061
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:12,109
blockchain AI

1062
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,150
cyber security solution that's going to

1063
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:15,319
just stop threats magically and shoot

1064
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:17,119
out little sparkles every time it

1065
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:18,950
happens but that's why we do it because

1066
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,859
this stuff is harder and it's not as

1067
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:23,660
cool okay but the goal of each of these

1068
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:25,759
is to reduce the risk so will doing

1069
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:28,339
these practices reduce your risk the

1070
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,210
answer is yes in my opinion anyone

1071
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:32,619
anyone I've seen anything here that you

1072
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:32,619
would say that shouldn't be up there oh

1073
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,960
good

1074
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:41,240
so do mean capabilities so I talked

1075
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,440
about the domain so you have a domain of

1076
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,000
access control so what does that mean

1077
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,220
well you have control access okay what

1078
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,540
does that mean well you have a

1079
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:50,328
capability here so each of these

1080
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:52,009
capability then is further broken down

1081
00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:54,559
into something we're trying to show here

1082
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:56,119
we'll go into so you have you have to

1083
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:57,380
establish system access requirements so

1084
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:00,079
what's required to get access to the

1085
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,670
system now this is a really simple thing

1086
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,940
that many of us don't have as an

1087
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:06,710
organization what do you require right

1088
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:09,589
now so if I if I come in here if I'm a

1089
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:11,210
new employee on your team or if I bring

1090
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:12,558
a system into your team I mean I mean

1091
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,059
some of you are going to be one weird

1092
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:15,770
you're gonna have have a knack or

1093
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:17,450
network access control where if I plug

1094
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:19,730
into a Ethernet cable I'm not getting

1095
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:20,839
access but but think about this and

1096
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:23,180
think about the implications across the

1097
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,859
board pretty pretty simple capability

1098
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:27,230
that covers a good bit right establish

1099
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:28,970
system access requirements do we have

1100
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:31,430
this control internal system access

1101
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:33,790
control remote system access limit data

1102
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:36,558
access to authorized users and processes

1103
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:37,759
pretty straightforward stuff so one of

1104
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:38,240
the good things about these about the

1105
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,640
CMMC

1106
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,078
so could ask another duty or censure

1107
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,500
question them and I'm sorry but it has

1108
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,880
anyone ever heard of 853 800-53 right

1109
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,890
it's this big massive spreadsheet with a

1110
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,540
bunch of control thing it's like I think

1111
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:51,650
it's up to four eight four fifty or four

1112
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,750
sixty because they just added supply

1113
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:55,700
chain they had a supply chain control

1114
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:58,910
family and Rev five that's it's out you

1115
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:01,430
don't know anyway so they go massive set

1116
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,420
of controls so that stuff is so I mean

1117
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:04,399
if it looks like it's written by a

1118
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,520
lawyer if you ever in the text so

1119
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,310
because you have to read it like four

1120
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,770
like I think I just gave them a kidney

1121
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:11,790
but I'm not sure but I feel like we did

1122
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,990
I'm not really sure what the nineth

1123
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,580
reads like it'll be like defines

1124
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,589
documents and specs what's view if you

1125
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,390
understand the structure of it it does

1126
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:19,890
make some sense but but this this

1127
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,240
because of they were pushing this out

1128
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,160
into small businesses they actually had

1129
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,810
to remove a lot of the language so this

1130
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,129
is pretty straightforward right you can

1131
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:28,529
understand I need to have access

1132
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:29,400
controls now I meant to heaven is I

1133
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:31,200
don't think I put it in there but I

1134
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,830
meant to have a grab hook up the access

1135
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,960
control so AC - one for NIST and then

1136
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:38,430
come back and look at this and say wow

1137
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,570
this is actually makes a lot of sense

1138
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:41,069
what you're gonna have is about four

1139
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:42,119
paragraphs of text err to talk about the

1140
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,830
different things you're supposed to be

1141
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:47,070
doing for access control whereas for

1142
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:49,980
here we're getting a step a very dumb

1143
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:55,710
down maybe not dumb down a very succinct

1144
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:58,430
version of what's on there okay so you

1145
00:38:55,710 --> 00:39:01,440
just get dropped into a job right and

1146
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:03,710
your boss says well hey we heard about

1147
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,810
these cyber things

1148
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:08,250
something about lasers and we need

1149
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:10,020
somebody who's gonna take care of it for

1150
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:15,150
us right so I need you to go build me a

1151
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:19,619
program so now just to be honest the

1152
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:20,940
Dilbert con concept cartoon is pretty

1153
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:23,220
appropriate because we can make up a lot

1154
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,630
of junk and our boss has no idea what's

1155
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,759
actually happening especially in smaller

1156
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:28,410
organizations I mean we could just set

1157
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,840
up you know and remember the Norse map

1158
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:33,600
it's like they're like lasers everywhere

1159
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,369
but just look like they're like 47

1160
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,690
billion cyberattacks stopped this

1161
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:37,590
instant or it launched from Russia and

1162
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:39,420
you're like wow this is great

1163
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:40,800
I mean it was based on like historical

1164
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,060
data it wasn't real they went bankrupt

1165
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,650
because they were like steamed up anyway

1166
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,540
good stuff right but we could just set

1167
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,830
that map up and put our little company

1168
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,869
logo in the corner or something and

1169
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:52,170
they'd be none the wiser they have no

1170
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:53,970
idea but see what what we should be

1171
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:56,700
doing is figuring out what our next

1172
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:58,290
steps are to make ourselves more secure

1173
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,240
or reduce the risk of our organization

1174
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,500
so level one it's a great place to start

1175
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,118
here so this is about demonstrating

1176
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:08,700
basic cyber hygiene now some of these

1177
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:10,200
controls are just that they're not

1178
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,060
something that are there's no

1179
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,520
revolutionary thing in level one however

1180
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,810
I mean it is interesting to me and I'm

1181
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,190
one thing I'm assuming that most of

1182
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:19,020
you've been in probably IT or security

1183
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,290
for some time and probably longer than I

1184
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,090
have

1185
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:24,120
but isn't it sad that we're still

1186
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:26,130
talking about the same things years and

1187
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:29,190
years and years and years and years down

1188
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:33,030
the road I mean because I mean it really

1189
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:34,530
is fun to chase the cool new tool but it

1190
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:36,060
really does seem like we have the same

1191
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:37,950
problem we had ten years ago if

1192
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:40,770
someone's using the same password or a

1193
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:42,750
weak password or no password or the

1194
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:45,690
default password I mean all these things

1195
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:48,390
are just the same thing so level one

1196
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:49,950
although it sounds boring probably still

1197
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:52,710
has some relevance no matter the size of

1198
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:54,450
your organization so some example

1199
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:55,530
controls there and what we're going to

1200
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:57,629
do next year we're going to kind of

1201
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:59,040
delve into for the sake of time okay

1202
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,480
let's we'll compare the different

1203
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,000
different levels so we're gonna I'm

1204
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,860
gonna take level one number four level -

1205
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,120
we're gonna pick a control sure the

1206
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,290
practices for that control what that

1207
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,940
would look like at level one and then

1208
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:10,470
show how how it grows in maturity as you

1209
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,780
go from level one to level two

1210
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:14,040
to finally level three all right so how

1211
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,420
do how do you demonstrate basic hygiene

1212
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,390
these are some things that you would do

1213
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:21,360
so what does that look like at level 1

1214
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:23,910
versus level 2 that would be taking that

1215
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,410
practice which which would be limiting

1216
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:27,000
information system access to the types

1217
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:28,319
of transactions and functions that

1218
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,110
authorized users are permitted to

1219
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,030
execute so do you have access to what

1220
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:35,220
you're sure to have access to pretty

1221
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:38,310
simple that's level 1 now level to

1222
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:40,319
intermediate hygiene you're now brushing

1223
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:44,130
your teeth three out of the seven days a

1224
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:45,450
week but pretty straightforward so just

1225
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:47,520
use non-privileged the council rolls

1226
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:49,439
when accessing non security functions

1227
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,850
but i do like the fact once again that

1228
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,380
so level one if you're a small

1229
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:55,710
organization with five computers and

1230
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:57,210
three employees you can see how you

1231
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:59,250
should be able to do these things right

1232
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:00,600
give them a separate account a lot of

1233
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,280
manual processes you may not have an

1234
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,770
automation I just have a good tech guy

1235
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,190
or something but then level two is gonna

1236
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:09,750
expand on those to add some real

1237
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:11,430
security well I say real to add some

1238
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,660
security additional security principles

1239
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:14,279
in there so ya going to have something

1240
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,359
like limiting on successful Olguin

1241
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,220
attempts so it's going to require some

1242
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,860
configuration probably assumes an

1243
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:22,259
organization of a little larger size so

1244
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:24,090
well once again it's still not and this

1245
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,350
is the actual requirement from the

1246
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:26,640
control so the total the total

1247
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:28,350
requirements in that capability for

1248
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,330
access control for limiting information

1249
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,860
access for level one level two this is

1250
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:33,299
this is what you have to do right then

1251
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,470
for level three

1252
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,510
you have everything from the first two

1253
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:38,930
and you're gonna continue on at level

1254
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:41,610
three which is obviously more difficult

1255
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:44,430
controlling next to mobile devices I

1256
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:46,740
mean is it possible to work without your

1257
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:47,970
cell phone anymore I don't think so

1258
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:50,850
right so we hadn't it so now we have to

1259
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:53,549
have cell phones connect to the network

1260
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:56,310
and of course that there was this time

1261
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:57,090
and s in the Dark Ages and I think that

1262
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,860
was the last time we didn't have

1263
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:01,020
smartphones or something where you like

1264
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:02,520
you didn't have to plug USBs in that I

1265
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,720
remembered that the incident I was

1266
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,850
talking about earlier with the DoD came

1267
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:07,049
out right when smartphones became so I

1268
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:09,540
feel like that what was really happening

1269
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:10,800
was was that some I'm gonna pickle my

1270
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,170
own generate some millennial somewhere

1271
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,210
like lost the charge like well sorry I'm

1272
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:16,710
gonna put the plug my he SVA so he goes

1273
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:18,600
in there and carves out the super glue

1274
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:20,520
sticks his yesterday him the port in

1275
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,900
anyway sorry it's a joke of the

1276
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,759
extensive one at the expense of

1277
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,710
Millennials but so could control and

1278
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,590
connection of mobile devices terminating

1279
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:30,510
user sessions but in reality just the

1280
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:32,670
next level of cybersecurity practices

1281
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:35,730
that you can do for the for this level

1282
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:37,890
so now see MMC defines up to five levels

1283
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:39,720
I didn't want to put everyone to sleep

1284
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:42,629
and I see what that's doing to you

1285
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:45,270
already it's like the talk of compliance

1286
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:47,340
we're reading the controls here we are

1287
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:48,390
we reached the pinnacle of human

1288
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:50,550
existence right we're reading the

1289
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:51,960
compliance controls but anyway so anyone

1290
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:54,660
go through levels four and five because

1291
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,700
it would do what it's doing but those

1292
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,830
levels are for more mature organizations

1293
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,089
so how many of you have been to have had

1294
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:05,160
the question if you're on a red team

1295
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:06,240
side hey we want a pen test okay I mean

1296
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,470
what's what's the state of your

1297
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,669
organizational secure I have no idea I

1298
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:10,799
just sort of need to get this pen test

1299
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:12,630
stuff done early okay that's great it'll

1300
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,980
be fun we'll be probably in there in ten

1301
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:15,720
minutes with an email and we'll be out

1302
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,490
and with whatever they told us to get in

1303
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,689
a day right but it doesn't really help

1304
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:20,640
anyone because they don't really

1305
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:22,109
understand the maturity so levels 4 & 5

1306
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,368
are at that level where you start

1307
00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:25,290
introducing things like penetration

1308
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:28,410
testing and interesting things like

1309
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:32,160
thread hunting like more stringent

1310
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:34,020
vulnerability assessments but especially

1311
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,259
increasing the repeatability of these

1312
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:38,970
things so if I had to take a poll how

1313
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,740
many of you could say that the security

1314
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:44,399
tasks that you have in your organization

1315
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:45,839
would be repeatable and automated and

1316
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,740
you can just say it may be a percentage

1317
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,360
like how much how much

1318
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,529
what I would like to have Automator or

1319
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,869
that I think could be automated is

1320
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:54,200
automated I mean even a larger large

1321
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:56,369
organization this is usually pretty low

1322
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,899
there's just it's hard it takes a lot of

1323
00:44:56,369 --> 00:45:00,240
time we have all these core cool

1324
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,950
orchestration tools that usually we get

1325
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,479
and don't have time to implement so we

1326
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,040
implement one cool process they're like

1327
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,840
hey look look what this could do and

1328
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,390
your boss is like great I'm glad you got

1329
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:11,940
it and then we don't look at it here for

1330
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:13,830
some years but so the next thing from

1331
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,240
sorry the important point is that we

1332
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:19,080
have to increase the repeatability of

1333
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:21,930
our tasking so thanks so seeing them see

1334
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:23,340
allows us to do that by I think it does

1335
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:25,740
because it gives us a compliance

1336
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:26,850
standard that CIM promotes their

1337
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:29,129
repeatability and automation of the

1338
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:30,270
tasks so here's the bad thing when you

1339
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,830
sign up for it then you gotta continue

1340
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,300
kind of stuck with it right have you go

1341
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:36,600
tell the boss hey hey boss I'd like to

1342
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,980
do X compliance standard I'd like X

1343
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,240
amount of dollars to support it and

1344
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,200
here's the levels and that's kind of

1345
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,430
that's kind of the cliff's you gotta

1346
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,779
jump off of right because you're putting

1347
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:44,339
yourself behind but than that but then I

1348
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,810
think again going back to the motivation

1349
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,600
factor or personally bought into

1350
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:50,880
something so CMMC is not a perfect

1351
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,890
compliance model by any stretch of the

1352
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,220
imagination however I think it does have

1353
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:56,970
the the capability to be something

1354
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,709
that's going to reduce your

1355
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:00,060
organization's risk in an effective way

1356
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:01,890
that you're not going to come at the end

1357
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:04,170
of the day and say well why are we still

1358
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:07,049
doing password changes every 30 days

1359
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:08,190
well NIST told us to write I didn't

1360
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:10,020
everyone liked that one for years and

1361
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:11,190
then like three months now yes probably

1362
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,270
six months ago now they said well we

1363
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:14,340
should have been telling people that

1364
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:16,800
because it was fast no thank you

1365
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:18,600
compliance we appreciate that so but as

1366
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,770
you increase repeatability you increase

1367
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,980
security not not just of your

1368
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:26,430
organization but all over the place so

1369
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:28,260
one of the things that is that is unique

1370
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:30,359
to us in cyber security is our increased

1371
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:32,670
security increases the security of the

1372
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:35,880
industry because I mean if you get owned

1373
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:37,080
well some of the most successful fishing

1374
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,390
campaigns levon launched have been

1375
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,520
fishing campaigns that come from so

1376
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:44,069
accessor organizations if you've ever

1377
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,020
got nailed on a phishing test I have

1378
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:47,250
gotten the other one fishing test an

1379
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,470
organ an organization we did business

1380
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:52,200
with got compromised and it sent me an

1381
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:53,430
email that was something that would have

1382
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,470
looked like a regular email click the

1383
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:57,000
link there it was so our security

1384
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:58,919
increases security of those around us so

1385
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,210
in addition the correlation the CMMI I

1386
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,790
mean massive

1387
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:04,260
productivity levels in developer and

1388
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:06,750
because of increased process which we

1389
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:09,780
all ask which we all hate so finally

1390
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:10,980
someone's gonna ask so we're at the

1391
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,030
point now where you're gonna get

1392
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:15,270
breached and someone's gonna ask you

1393
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:16,650
what you did what did you do what did

1394
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:19,950
your team do what does your organization

1395
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:21,630
do for cybersecurity like show us show

1396
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:26,790
us the stats right what do we do well

1397
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:28,950
yesterday I ran LS on my box I checked

1398
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:33,000
for connections looked at some cat

1399
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:34,919
photos so what do we show them right so

1400
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,960
whether whether you're required legally

1401
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,280
or not to be compliant with any

1402
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,510
compliance standard you got to be

1403
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,580
thinking about this question how are you

1404
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:43,290
going to answer the bell when someone

1405
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:45,540
knocks at the door and says hey we found

1406
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:47,960
X coming from your IPS how to get there

1407
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:50,759
and what are you doing for security so

1408
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:53,040
secondly compliance is that insurance so

1409
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,410
you can go by cyber insurance good luck

1410
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,779
getting a claim foot field field good

1411
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:59,220
luck getting a claim filled I mean have

1412
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:03,599
you has anyone heard of a successful

1413
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:05,580
cybersecurity claim it was paid by the

1414
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,380
insurance or you can look up Maersk

1415
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:09,810
several the big ones insurance is like

1416
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:11,550
nope that was an act of war because

1417
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:13,410
reasons all right I just get the pic

1418
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:15,750
what they what they gonna pay or not so

1419
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:17,940
I mean you can rely on insurance but and

1420
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:20,190
then finally it does reduce your risk I

1421
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,720
think I've tried to outline some of

1422
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:23,490
those reasons here but when you when you

1423
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:25,560
implement effective repeatable security

1424
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:26,580
controls you're going to do the thing

1425
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,000
that we're supposed to be doing which is

1426
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:32,359
reducing the risk of our organization's

1427
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,359
that's all I have

1428
00:48:36,339 --> 00:48:38,400
you

1429
00:48:45,619 --> 00:48:47,680
you
