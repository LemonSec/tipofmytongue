1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,990

talk before lunch so as required I'm

3
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:22,168
supposed to make a joke about being the

4
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:26,348
last talk before lunch this is that joke

5
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:28,599
anyhoo today welcome to what we're doing

6
00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:29,619
the shadows going dark with consumer

7
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:32,969
electronics we're going to talk about

8
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:35,680
some personal privacy stuff today

9
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,020
beforehand a little bit about me you can

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,829

12
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:46,839
they we're not talking about the CH

13
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:50,230
right now by day I work as a security

14
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:53,129
engineer and at night I'm also the

15
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,998
co-founder of black bear InfoSec a

16
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,140
little bit about what we're going to be

17
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:59,109
covering today we're going to talk about

18
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,640
the privacy problem some essentials

19
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:02,769
tools that you're gonna need to take

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,110
back your privacy we'll walk through a

21
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:07,270
practical example we'll do some try

22
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,940
harder measures some things you can do

23
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:12,460
that go out go above and beyond and then

24
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:15,658
hopefully we will have time for Q&A I

25
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:18,610
anticipate there being time for Q&A so

26
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,759
let's just jump into it first things

27
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:23,200
first we need to talk about you all

28
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,450
right because this is really about you

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,289
right and everything that you need in

30
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:31,000
order to live life right so we have your

31
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,860
credit cards your bank accounts your

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,090
cell phone and your computer without

33
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:40,030
those you pretty much cannot exist or

34
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:43,810
function easily in today's economy right

35
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,880
and then we have everything that you buy

36
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,759
right everything that you need to pay

37
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:52,270
for everything that you use your clothes

38
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,770
your car your cameras your pictures yeah

39
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,740
you know you're eating out your social

40
00:01:53,770 --> 00:02:00,070
media habits and what all of this

41
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:03,579
information does is create a unique

42
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:07,178
picture of who you are as a person and

43
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:09,340
that information is valuable that's why

44
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:11,260
there are companies that exist selling

45
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,440
this information they can target you

46
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,910
specifically and the reason they're able

47
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,329
to do that is because of what we call

48
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:22,510
primary keys so primary keys include

49
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,550
phone number email address name address

50
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,560
IP address the IMEI

51
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:30,540
d of your phone and your browser

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,460
fingerprint now if you're like me though

53
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:37,209
you see all this cool tech stuff right

54
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:41,050
and you want to be able to use it like

55
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:43,180
you know that they're selling that data

56
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,650
right but you want to use this don't

57
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,630
tell me that you don't want to be able

58
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,150
to yell at your Amazon echo and have it

59
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,370
change this thermostat or you me you

60
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,560
realize you're out of I don't know maybe

61
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,960
a 16 pack of Red Bull while you're

62
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,700
trying to write a presentation for

63
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,020
secure West Virginia and you don't want

64
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,359
to have to deal with any of that so you

65
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:04,300
just yell at your Siri and the package

66
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,600
shows up two days later right but you

67
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:11,170
also know that they're selling that data

68
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,910
but you want to use it so here's my

69
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,420
suggestion this is how we're gonna fix

70
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:19,960
this problem don't use it any questions

71
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:22,890
I got plenty of time we got time for

72
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:26,340
questions right exactly

73
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:30,040
now we want to be able to use this right

74
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:34,080
so how can we use all of this cool stuff

75
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:37,000
but not give up all of our information

76
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,310
well fortunately they all require an

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,310
account and this is where we can start

78
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:45,370
going dark right so before we had this

79
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:48,610
really unique web of things that make

80
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:51,610
you uniquely you to these companies what

81
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:54,850
if we could do with our personal lives

82
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:58,390
what we already do with our data on our

83
00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:01,810
networks and that's segmented firewall

84
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,579
it off from one another and that's

85
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,190
actually possible you can create

86
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:10,920
multiple identities and be multiple

87
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:13,270
people for a relatively low investment

88
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,329
but we need some essentials in order to

89
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:19,120
do that the first things first we need a

90
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:20,769
phone because without a phone you don't

91
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,600
have a phone number and without a phone

92
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:25,990
number you can't register for a lot of

93
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:30,760
these services so how many Android users

94
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:36,039
do I have in the audience you guys are

95
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:37,570
gonna hate me I'm so sorry so this is

96
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:38,469
not going to be a conversation about

97
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,230
what is it

98
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,750
and what is private I definitely think

99
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:46,690
that Android is one of the more secure

100
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:49,450
operating systems I definitely think

101
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:52,060
it's up to snuff but I actually know I

102
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:57,550
know for a fact it is not nearly as

103
00:04:52,060 --> 00:05:01,450
private as Apple devices the problem

104
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:04,120
with Google is that they make their

105
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:07,479
living off of selling your information

106
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,730
and while I don't like Apple they have

107
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,520
found it profitable to their

108
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:15,910
shareholders to market privacy and be a

109
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:19,210
private company for you this will change

110
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:22,330
over time but for right now Apple is

111
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:25,180
probably gonna be your best bet when it

112
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:28,900
comes to a private cell phone wall

113
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:31,200
garden arguments aside and the reason

114
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,280
I'm using Apple is because it's also a

115
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,920
it's something that people are familiar

116
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,169
with a lot of these privacy measures I

117
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,310
don't want just you to be able to use I

118
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,830
want you to be able to take these

119
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,260
measures home and teach them to your mom

120
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,450
and your aunts and your cousins and your

121
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,480
friends and your loved ones right

122
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:52,180
and the next honorable mention which is

123
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,090
graphene OS is not something you're

124
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,550
gonna want to walk them through so

125
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:01,630
graphene OS is actually an Android Fork

126
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:04,270
of copperhead OS don't use copperhead OS

127
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:07,360
I cannot verify that it's actually

128
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:10,599
secure but graphene OS is made by the

129
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,520
original developer of copperhead OS it

130
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,740
is private by design think of it like

131
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,740
cubes for your phone we'll get into that

132
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,720
and a little think of it like cubes for

133
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,580
your phone it's from the ground up

134
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,400
stripped out of everything that Google

135
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,310
needs in order to track you with some

136
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,690
extra bits put in the problem is in

137
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:32,110
order to do that there's a specific

138
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:35,020
device set that you need and then you

139
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:39,040
have to you're not walking your mom

140
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:42,310
through using ADB and fastboot to flash

141
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,390
her pixel three over the phone that's

142
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,850
not gonna happen that's not a

143
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:48,940
supportable model that might work for

144
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:51,620
you that's why I mention it so we need

145
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,210
an iPhone but the quest

146
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:57,280
I always get as well 10 done iphones

147
00:06:53,210 --> 00:07:00,289
cost a lot of money yes they do however

148
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,659
you can get a pretty cheap iPhone 6s

149
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:05,960
which is still remarkably supported

150
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:08,180
under the current iOS 13 for anywhere

151
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,340
between 100 to 200 bucks depending on

152
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,260
where you pick it up and what sales they

153
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:16,820
have so I wouldn't say that that's out

154
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:19,370
of the realm of possibility but next we

155
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,159
need cell service because we need to be

156
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,080
able to send and receive text messages

157
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,880
send and receive data which means we're

158
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,550
gonna need a SIM card and here's the

159
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:32,150
problem with SIM cards right has anyone

160
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:34,910
heard of sim jacking sim swapping can

161
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:37,039
yeah okay cool so basically it's when

162
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,930
you call the telephone company and use

163
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,460
information to transfer your phone

164
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,760
number to a different SIM card for

165
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:49,219
malicious purposes we're gonna

166
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:51,710
circumvent all of that mint sim is a

167
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,680
great company they resell t-mobile and

168
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:57,260
more importantly they do not require

169
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,030
real information about you in order to

170
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,389
register for their service they take

171
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:03,950
prepaid cards they take gift cards and

172
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:05,450
then they really only need enough

173
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,479
information about you that you'll

174
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:11,659
remember to open the account so you can

175
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,010
be John Doe and we're gonna get to why

176
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,840
we're not gonna actually use the phone

177
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,409
number attached to this Tim card in a

178
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,448
minute but that's going to be important

179
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:24,050
the other alternative is you could

180
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:26,750
actually do this whole setup with a ipod

181
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,370
touch and a mobile hotspot

182
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,280
I recommend the calyx Institute they're

183
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:33,979
a nonprofit that will let you for a

184
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,049
donation they provide you with an

185
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:39,349
unlimited hotspot I think it's like 600

186
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:42,348
bucks a year through sprint which is

187
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:46,130
fantastic and eliminates a lot of the

188
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:48,350
IME ID tracking well let's get into our

189
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,200
toolkit alright so we have a cell phone

190
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,670
we are able to connect to the internet

191
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,770
now what because we want to actually

192
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:57,250
start using these services that are

193
00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:00,230
attached to all these cool devices right

194
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,089
first we need email and it needs to be

195
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:05,030
private and this is how we're gonna set

196
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:05,540
it up we're gonna find a privacy focused

197
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:09,230
provider

198
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,209
we're gonna create a new account we're

199
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,620
gonna use you know the I shouldn't have

200
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:15,140
to say this but I do

201
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,680
two-factor and a secure password and

202
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,660
more importantly don't use this email

203
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,989
anywhere and we're gonna get to why in a

204
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,579
minute

205
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:26,660
all of this is gonna make sense in the

206
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:28,730
practical example some private email

207
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,850
providers this is a list from privacy

208
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,440
tools IO which is a great resource if

209
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,880
you're ever like I want to use this

210
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,460
service but I don't think it's private

211
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,340
privacy tools IO will probably have an

212
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,470
alternative for you that you can use of

213
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:46,790
these I recommend the top three

214
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:49,400
protonmail dis root org and time to know

215
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:54,260
- they have legal backing behind them

216
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:57,020
that has shown them to be private and

217
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,250
that's pretty much it you're gonna set

218
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,260
up that email and you're gonna hold on

219
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,150
to that don't tell anyone that you have

220
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,910
this email and preferably don't make it

221
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,300
easily identifiable to you so don't make

222
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,530
it

223
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:11,810
soccer chick 99 or you know hacker dude

224
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:16,870
38 you want to make it so that it's not

225
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:19,369
tied to any identifiable info about you

226
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,440
but now that we have that private email

227
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,470
well we're not giving that out how do we

228
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,440
send and receive email well that's where

229
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:30,200
blur comes in and blur allows you to

230
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,110
create masked emails that you're able to

231
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:36,950
create per service that you use and it

232
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:39,140
will forward all of those emails to your

233
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,580
private email so blur is the only

234
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:44,120
company that's really going to ever know

235
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:47,210
what that private email is there is an

236
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,760
honorable mention which is 33 mail it

237
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:52,220
will allow you to create a unique

238
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,980
subdomain and then sort of like how you

239
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,910
can use tags in Gmail it will

240
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,640
auto-generate

241
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:01,280
email addresses on the fly to that sub

242
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,730
domain so for example if you're signing

243
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:07,730
up for slack you wouldn't have to go in

244
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:09,470
and create a a slack email address you

245
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:13,130
could just sign up for slack with like

246
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,540
slack at hacker dude 33 mail.com and it

247
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,760
would auto generate that email address

248
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,500
and forward all your email the only

249
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,950
reason why it's an honorable mention and

250
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,830
not Mike

251
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:25,340
to strategy is because that domain name

252
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:26,870
becomes unique to you and that is

253
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:30,650
something that companies will be able to

254
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:32,780
pivot on but we're able to get emails

255
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:36,260
now a lot of these services they require

256
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:37,970
some sort of credit card or something to

257
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,939
use some of their more premium services

258
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,170
for example Amazon Prime Apple music you

259
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,020
want to be able to use that stuff with

260
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,569
these devices that's why you bought them

261
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:49,310
so we need to be able to make payments

262
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,920
and that's where privacy calm is going

263
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,869
to come in privacy calm if you haven't

264
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,490
seen it they allow you to create

265
00:11:53,870 --> 00:12:01,100
single-use or single vendor credit cards

266
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:03,170
the purchases are then obscured

267
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,960
from your real info when you make

268
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,640
purchases so we'll just validate with

269
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,380
whatever information you give them so it

270
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,080
doesn't actually have to be your

271
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,710
personal information and on the other

272
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,800
side

273
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:18,440
privacy calm obscures the info that your

274
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,349
bank is receiving so when you make a

275
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,960
purchase instead of Walmart com

276
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,790
appearing on your bank statement you can

277
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,700
have it's a privacy com

278
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:31,430
so according to my bank I shop

279
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,290
exclusively at the NSA gift shop that's

280
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:37,699
where I get all my groceries all my

281
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:39,680
Christmas presents all of it so finally

282
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,690
we have an action we've talked about SIM

283
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,219
cards we talked about phones we haven't

284
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,350
talked about phone numbers a number

285
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,720
before I said we're not using our actual

286
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,030
phone number that's a tied to our sim

287
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,070
card and the phone number we're gonna

288
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:56,390
use is going to be through an app called

289
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:58,910
my pseudo and this is also why iOS is

290
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:02,560
the preferred platform because at this

291
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:06,140
current moment my pseudo is only on iOS

292
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:09,140
they haven't ported it to Android just

293
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,460
yet but I hear that it's coming but for

294
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,290
right now you're sort of locked into the

295
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:15,860
iOS ecosystem if you want to use this

296
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:18,380
app so it will allow you to create

297
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,060
multiple identities with local phone

298
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:24,680
numbers and email addresses that will

299
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:27,020
appear to everyone else as real it'll

300
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,880
allow you to communicate with none my

301
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,910
pseudo users so you'll actually be able

302
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,720
to call out to your local numbers and

303
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,759
internationally

304
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,440
and more importantly it's going to be a

305
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:38,420
replacement for your primary phone

306
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,069
number so when we create multiple

307
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,810
identities we would create multiple

308
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:44,990
identities for what we're going to be

309
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:47,630
for our use cases right for example I

310
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,699
have a my sudu that I gave out to my

311
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:52,939
wife and my family I have a my pseudo

312
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:54,529
that I give out when I go to the gas

313
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:58,699
station and I fill up and I want those

314
00:13:54,529 --> 00:14:02,329
sweet sweet sweet like return dollars I

315
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:05,209
have a my pseudo that I use for every

316
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:07,219
other store membership or Amazon

317
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:12,410
what-have-you there's one specifically

318
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:14,870
for 2fa I do not give out the number

319
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:17,630
associated with my SIM card which is

320
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:20,180
twofold one I skip out of all those sim

321
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:22,370
jackin attacks but more importantly I

322
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:25,370
can swap my SIM card whenever I want and

323
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:28,730
frequently do and you should too so you

324
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:32,509
eliminate the the ability to track what

325
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:34,180
car what SIM card you have now we got to

326
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:37,399
talk about your old number for a minute

327
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:39,500
because that is still tied to you you've

328
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:41,720
probably used it for a while now I know

329
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:45,350
a lot of people haven't changed their

330
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,519
phone number in like a decade what do

331
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,709
you do with that old phone number

332
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,810
because there is people are gonna still

333
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:52,579
try and contact that phone number right

334
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,589
it's not like you get a new phone number

335
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:57,290
magically everyone's contact list

336
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:59,209
updates right so what you don't want to

337
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,130
have happen is you get rid of that phone

338
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:03,649
number and then that number goes back

339
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,180
into the public pool of available phone

340
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:09,079
numbers and now someone else is

341
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,969
receiving texts meant for you and this

342
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:13,189
is where I this is the only time I'm

343
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:15,110
going to recommend a gmail service or a

344
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:17,000
Google service I apologize google

345
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,829
service which is Google Voice Google

346
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,529
Voice will allow you to port your

347
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:23,719
personal phone number to their service

348
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:25,370
now you probably already have a gmail

349
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,199
address they probably already have a

350
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:29,180
significant amount of information on you

351
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,099
there don't go out and create a gmail

352
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,810
address just to do this you use one that

353
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,870
you've already that's already been

354
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:39,369
burned and you would just port your

355
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:41,990
phone number over to this gmail address

356
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:45,350
and then what you'll be able to do is

357
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,580
forward any calls or messages that you

358
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,760
receive on that number

359
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:52,910
to your private email address via blur

360
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:56,029
or 33 male and then be able to respond

361
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,860
to those people from your new number and

362
00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:00,769
be able to tell them hey you know what

363
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:03,529
my numbers changed here's my new contact

364
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:05,990
info whatever it may be and the reason I

365
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:09,230
recommend Gmail is because again private

366
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:11,029
no secure probably one of the best

367
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:15,200
companies when it comes to security

368
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:18,519
right so we have a toolkit and I'm sure

369
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:21,440
a lot of this seems sort of disparate

370
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,570
we're actually gonna start putting this

371
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,950
all together in a practical example so

372
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,180
you can see how all of this sort of

373
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:31,040
flows together

374
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:33,709
right so remember before we have this we

375
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,810
want to be here not this this not this

376
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:40,729
this right so let's pretend for example

377
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:43,699
we won an Amazon echo with one of our

378
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:46,640
vendors outside right and we want to be

379
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:52,250
able to use that but that needs to be

380
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:53,959
tied to an Amazon account well we just

381
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,700
talked about how Amazon and Google and

382
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:57,469
everyone is selling our data how do we

383
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,740
do that while maintaining privacy oh

384
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:03,939
that's where blur comes in we can

385
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:06,829
actually hop in and create a new account

386
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:09,740
give it a blur email address with a

387
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:13,399
super secure password blur is going to

388
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:16,280
go ahead and forward that email to my

389
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:21,350
protonmail address I'll be able to

390
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:25,520
verify it and now I have a verified

391
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:26,809
email on an amazon.com account next we

392
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,330
want to set up two-factor authentication

393
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:32,270
that requires a phone number that's

394
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:34,309
where my to-do comes in so what we do is

395
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:39,860
we login to my studio and we create a

396
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:42,379
new identity we pick a phone number the

397
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:44,780
identities created and you can see that

398
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,750
Amazon has no problem sending you in one

399
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:51,470
time one time password to verify that

400
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:53,480
phone number so now we have our Amazon

401
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,400
echo it's got an account that's

402
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,740
registered we have two factor

403
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,960
authentication set up we want to be able

404
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,560
to make purchases I want to be able to

405
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,430
yell

406
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:07,250
that I need I don't know Soylent at 3:00

407
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:09,470
a.m. at this Amazon echo so we need to

408
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:12,470
be able to make purchases and that is

409
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:14,330
where privacy calm comes in we log in

410
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,950
and create a new card that is a real

411
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:18,560
card so the first person to be able to

412
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:23,360
punch that number in gets $10 on Amazon

413
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:26,360
go ahead have that but we can see here

414
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,479
it has no problem verifying our fake

415
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,669
name on the card and that's a which one

416
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,370
is that Wilshire Boulevard yeah that's

417
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:37,310
just a hotel in the middle of in the

418
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:39,649
middle of LA doesn't actually have to be

419
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:43,909
real information Amazon accepts it no

420
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:46,690
problem so now we have an Amazon echo

421
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:51,230
that we have a phone number tied to and

422
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:54,500
a credit card tied to and we're able to

423
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:57,080
make purchases right we're basically

424
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,770
private we've done it that's it end of

425
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,460
discussion

426
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:05,090
there's nothing else we can do right

427
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:07,340
right no I'm sure you all have already

428
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:09,199
sort of picked apart some of this stuff

429
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,470
and gone well what where are you

430
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,300
receiving this stuff what about your IP

431
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,170
address what about this what about that

432
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,550
Wow

433
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:19,220
that's where we're gonna get into some

434
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:24,669
of this try harder stuff first thing

435
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:27,680
we're gonna do is worry about our ISP so

436
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:31,660
keep in mind that this was created

437
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:33,860
before Nord VPN had its whole debacle

438
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:36,110
you're gonna want to beat the end right

439
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,169
you want to protect the information

440
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:41,810
that's flowing to and from your computer

441
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:43,430
you want to obscure it through VPN my

442
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:46,399
recommendations are actually expressed

443
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:48,080
VPN and private Internet access I know

444
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,790
there's going to be a lot of discussion

445
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,850
around like five eyes and this that and

446
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:55,280
the other thing what expressvpn and

447
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:56,870
privacy are private internet access are

448
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,110
the only two companies that have legal

449
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:02,090
backing where their claims of not having

450
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:05,240
logs or information on the people using

451
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:08,600
their service those have been tested in

452
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,400
Turkish and American courts so I can say

453
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,189
with some amount of certainty that they

454
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,330
actually stick true to the claims

455
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,190
they're making

456
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,540
the most important thing though when it

457
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:21,110
comes to these services that we're

458
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,700
talking about you need to pay for it the

459
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:25,419
reason why you get Gmail for free is

460
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,740
because you are the you are the product

461
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,210
pay for these services so that they can

462
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:32,570
stay in business and they don't have to

463
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:35,420
resort to selling your data so that

464
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:36,919
covers your personal devices right but

465
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,690
what about the rest of your network I

466
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,830
don't know if you've ever tried to talk

467
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,440
to a layperson

468
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,510
about setting up a VPN but as soon as

469
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,550
you get past the work or the letter V

470
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,780
their eyes glaze over they roll back

471
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:50,180
into their head and they just think

472
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:52,580
you're paranoid right so what I actually

473
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,980
suggest is for the loved ones in your

474
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,770
home that maybe aren't tech savvy you

475
00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:00,800
can actually tunnel everything over a

476
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:03,200
VPN to these VPN services using some of

477
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,770
this awesome router software open sense

478
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,600
and PF sense or two for two the same

479
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:12,520
software but they will allow you to

480
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,520
install on pretty much anything

481
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:20,570
relatively secure router OS and they

482
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,370
will also allow you to do like

483
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:25,360
enterprise features such as tunneling

484
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:28,669
all your traffic out over one of the

485
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,580
previously mentioned VPNs and they

486
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:34,400
support a ton of hardware you can run it

487
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:38,510
on protect Lee is what I use they're

488
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,310
basically knucks but for routers you

489
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:44,090
could also just run it off of an Intel

490
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:48,350
nook I'm a big fan of eBay hardware as

491
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:50,179
well I'm a big fan of making sure that

492
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:52,850
stuff doesn't wind up in the trash and

493
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:55,610
you're actually recycling stuff and then

494
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:58,669
but realistically anything with two

495
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:01,310
Knicks and four gigs of RAM in a okay

496
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:02,990
processor and as long as you have

497
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:07,429
storage space for logs you could run

498
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:09,020
this off of a USB stick so we've covered

499
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:12,950
your eyes P let's talk about your

500
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:18,410
personal computer so you two real

501
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:19,970
options Macs and PCs and it's going to

502
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:23,950
be a shocker but I would actually

503
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:27,410
recommend the Lenovo over Apple any day

504
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,770
you can pick up a used lenovo for any

505
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:31,400
way

506
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:33,980
between 100 to 200 bucks they're usually

507
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,140
from enterprise companies which means

508
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:40,790
they were taken care of by some stickler

509
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:42,770
IT guy and they're in relatively good

510
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:45,290
condition the other thing that's great

511
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:48,650
about them is you can install coreboot

512
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:50,930
on them most of them and eliminate any

513
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:54,350
proprietary software that actually runs

514
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:56,900
on these devices so then we need to talk

515
00:22:54,350 --> 00:23:01,129
about what OS we're installing right

516
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:06,530
well Windows 10 is kind of a privacy

517
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:08,990
nightmare by default and Macs Apple just

518
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,610
makes dumb to sit I can't express to you

519
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:12,050
how dumb the decisions some of them they

520
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:15,379
make sometimes when it comes to their

521
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:17,419
software so unfortunately or fortunately

522
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,820
Linux is the way you're gonna want to go

523
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:23,240
with some of this right and again

524
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:27,439
there's really two options I recommend

525
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:30,110
for 99% of people a hardened Debian

526
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,880
instance is more than enough if you want

527
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:38,600
to get really really stickler about it

528
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:41,240
what you could do is use do bian which

529
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,129
is again there's no proprietary software

530
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,720
in there at all it's all open-source

531
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,480
software if you want to be able to

532
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,370
actually look in and peek at the code

533
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,280
the other option which is what I use is

534
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:56,090
actually called cubes has anyone heard

535
00:23:52,280 --> 00:24:00,050
of cubes okay cool so for everyone else

536
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:03,139
cubes is doing for your computer what we

537
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:06,409
just did for our life essentially it is

538
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:10,760
a hypervisor operating system that has a

539
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:14,870
desktop and a GUI and will actually spin

540
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:17,150
up individual VM instances based on what

541
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,790
you're doing so you would have for

542
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:22,460
example personal VM and that's where you

543
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:24,889
did all your personal social media stuff

544
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:27,230
you would have a secure VM and that's

545
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:30,860
where you did all your banking you could

546
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:32,960
have a VM that just has say your your

547
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,570
password database and that doesn't

548
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,920
actually get connected to the Internet

549
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:38,810
that's just there so that you can copy

550
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,460
and paste passwords from it into your

551
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:44,490
other services it's a fantastic

552
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:49,470
take fantastic tool and honestly warrant

553
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:51,299
a talk on its own but then we talked

554
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:53,730
about services a little bit in that

555
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:56,190
they're connected to these IOT devices

556
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:59,460
these consumer electronics that we want

557
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:01,260
to use and we use a lot of them every

558
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,360
day in an in addition to these devices

559
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,640
these services are also collecting

560
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,760
information about us and they're almost

561
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,919
impossible to avoid right you need a

562
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,740
password manager you need an easy way to

563
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:17,700
share files you need to be able to

564
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:20,779
search the web all of this stuff you

565
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:23,850
sort of can't get away from and for most

566
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:25,289
laypeople that is the case that they

567
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,969
need to share files they're going to

568
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:29,220
Dropbox if they need to search something

569
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,659
they're going to Google everyone in this

570
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,760
room is in a unique position that they

571
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:36,120
have some interest in technology and

572
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,100
thus have the ability to self host

573
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,408
alternatives and this is the thing that

574
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,870
I really want to drive home is you don't

575
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:45,570
have to use any of the services directly

576
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:51,059
tied to these devices there's more than

577
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:53,639
one way to skin a cow you can self host

578
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:56,520
a ton of these alternatives or a ton of

579
00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:00,149
these solutions and you would be doing

580
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,980
yourself and your loved ones a great

581
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:05,360
service by ripping them out of these

582
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:08,039
ecosystems next cloud is awesome as a

583
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,740
Dropbox alternative as well as like

584
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:13,830
Google Drive and calendars and stuff bit

585
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:16,529
warden has come a long long long way as

586
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:18,840
far as password management and I would

587
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:23,760
say is a great competitor to LastPass in

588
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:26,580
1password MB instead of Netflix you can

589
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:32,549
use MB with your own personal media that

590
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:34,139
you acquire right and you might think

591
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:37,379
okay well I don't really have a whole

592
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:39,480
lot of time to stand that all up and

593
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:42,899
that's where I can honestly recommend

594
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:46,440
wholeheartedly a project by a dude named

595
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:48,779
Nick Busey called home lab OS it's just

596
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:52,200
a set of ansible scripts which if you

597
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:54,179
have an hour and 500 extra gigs of hard

598
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,380
drive space you can spin up a lot of

599
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:58,950
these solution

600
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,780
in about a half an hour and you can get

601
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,539
the DNS records and everything set up in

602
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:07,559
an afternoon it's not that difficult and

603
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:12,539
this this tool makes it really really

604
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:15,059
really easy so let's talk about some

605
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:16,590
cons to all of this right because this

606
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:21,059
all sounds all well and good but there

607
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:23,280
are some significant downsides one it's

608
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:25,379
hard with some of these services to get

609
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,580
around they recognize a lot of these

610
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,289
phone numbers as quote-unquote

611
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:32,309
disposable and will not let you register

612
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:33,600
my recommendation for that is

613
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:38,460
unfortunately just don't use those

614
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:41,100
services the other thing is a lot of

615
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:44,909
places get real sketchy about privacy

616
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:46,260
comm because the way privacy comm works

617
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:48,659
those credit cards are actually

618
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,220
recognized as gift cards so a lot of

619
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:55,140
people think you're trying to scam them

620
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:57,270
specifically PayPal which don't use

621
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:00,690
PayPal I can't say that enough doesn't

622
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:05,270
avoid PayPal at all costs but they'll

623
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:05,270
get real sketch about like gift cards

624
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:11,190
second or third there's added complexity

625
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:13,159
to your life because now in addition to

626
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,360
managing your own personal information

627
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:17,159
you also have to worry about all the

628
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,120
fake information that you just created

629
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:24,539
right so now it's not just you know John

630
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:28,439
it's also John and Joe and Steve and

631
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:30,450
Dave and Alyssa you know all these fake

632
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,789
personas that you've created you now

633
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:36,270
have to remember or keep track of all of

634
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:37,169
that information for example if I were

635
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,210
to die today

636
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:41,429
my wife would lose the house because she

637
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:45,530
would be unable to pay any of the bills

638
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:48,030
because none of them are in my name and

639
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:49,830
finally it doesn't account for anyone

640
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:52,470
else so like the wife example before

641
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:55,889
yeah this will cover you but this is not

642
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:58,830
going to prevent you know your aunt or

643
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:01,080
your cousin or your uncle from putting

644
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,149
your phone number in their in their in

645
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,220
their phone and then downloading some

646
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:09,299
sketchy app that sips up all their data

647
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:11,610
or you know tagging a photo of you

648
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:16,710
on Facebook this doesn't account for

649
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:19,408
those people but more critically there's

650
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:21,210
two things privacy fatigue is probably

651
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:23,279
the biggest one this is a lot of work

652
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:27,210
okay I'm not gonna sit here in LA dia

653
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:31,350
this is a ton of work and honestly it

654
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:33,360
shouldn't be there should be controls in

655
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:36,570
place to prevent this from being a thing

656
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,979
right the this warrantless scooping of

657
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:43,529
your own data and more importantly money

658
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:45,600
we are all fortunate enough to have

659
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:49,049
money to come to this conference to be

660
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:52,049
able to stay in hotel or be able to pay

661
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:56,249
for the ticket but unfortunately a lot

662
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:58,549
of people don't have that same financial

663
00:29:56,249 --> 00:30:00,989
buying power right and unfortunately

664
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:03,960
those are the people that are most

665
00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:06,119
susceptible to their data being slurped

666
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,159
up a person that's living

667
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:11,249
paycheck-to-paycheck is not going to be

668
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,659
able to buy or worry about their privacy

669
00:30:11,249 --> 00:30:14,580
because they're too worried about

670
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:16,259
putting food on the table and that

671
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:19,590
should not be the case they should have

672
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:21,960
just as much that you have just as much

673
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:24,840
right to their personal privacy as we do

674
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,039
and that's why privacy should never be

675
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,988
kept behind a paywall

676
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:30,059
I don't think you should have to pay to

677
00:30:27,989 --> 00:30:32,489
make yourself private that should be a

678
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:34,830
protection that's in place inherently in

679
00:30:32,489 --> 00:30:37,710
our system and fortunately in California

680
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:40,949
I think it was last week actually the EF

681
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:43,080
F just ruled that they passed a law that

682
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:45,179
adds some consumer perfect privacy

683
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,299
protections but not a lot and that's

684
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:52,019
where we really need to get also real

685
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:53,429
quick shout-out to Rachel lamp of badass

686
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:55,109
army if you're not following them on

687
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:57,629
Twitter you really should they do

688
00:30:55,109 --> 00:30:59,970
wonderful work for revenge porn laws

689
00:30:57,629 --> 00:31:04,080
that's antecedent to all of this I just

690
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:06,720
like giving them a shout-out here's a

691
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,539
list of all of my resources I encourage

692
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,149
you don't just take me at blind faith go

693
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:15,480
look at these services read their

694
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:17,219
privacy policies really dig in there and

695
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,559
one tip I will give you right off the

696
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,869
bat if they say third party services and

697
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:23,100
they mention your data will be shared

698
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:27,110
with third party service

699
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:29,459
is in the normal doing business of

700
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:31,469
ex-service that means they're selling

701
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,150
your data if they don't call out

702
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:35,669
specifically what they're using and

703
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:41,370
who's getting what data they are selling

704
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:44,900
your data and then finally the privacy

705
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:47,280
and the privacy security and OSINT show

706
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,809
michael Buzzelli i think of them

707
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,910
pronouncing his name right he is a

708
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:52,590
fantastic resource and i can't say

709
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:55,020
enough good things about him

710
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:58,168
he is the reason that this talk exists

711
00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:00,480
he was the inspiration and you should

712
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:02,429
really listen to his podcast if this was

713
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,980
not enough or you feel like you want to

714
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:10,230
learn more his podcast is a fantastic

715
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:12,960
resource that is my time I think I have

716
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:15,380
about 20 minutes for questions are there

717
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,380
any questions

718
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:25,350
I'm sorry in the back I'm excited to see

719
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:29,700
what happens

720
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:33,449
but from my understanding the libre mon

721
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,919
is sort of and they're very confusing

722
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:41,549
with the information they put out about

723
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:43,169
that phone their there their blog posts

724
00:32:41,549 --> 00:32:45,629
are kind of weird and it doesn't sound

725
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:48,510
like they know what they're doing when

726
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,830
it comes to phone production their

727
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:51,929
laptops i think they have a very

728
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:54,809
different model because their laptops

729
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:56,760
are basically like white label toshiba's

730
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:58,500
that they sent schematics to in china

731
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,350
and they just they're like toshiba

732
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,789
shelves and they just rebrand them and

733
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,980
put their information and the work that

734
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:07,559
they've done on the software side for

735
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,909
the intel management engine and and the

736
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:11,428
pressure they've put on Intel is

737
00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:16,020
fantastic but I don't know if they know

738
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:17,700
how to build a phone I don't so I'm

739
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:20,789
hesitant to be like yeah that's a great

740
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:23,390
option I would want to wait until I see

741
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:23,390
that mature

742
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:38,580
I don't it's great for it's a great step

743
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,690
forward I would say but I wouldn't say

744
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:44,460
that it is something that's I don't like

745
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:47,040
having all my eggs in one basket so I

746
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,240
don't want to trust Apple with a whole

747
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,740
lot even though I trust them

748
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,309
significantly more than maybe some other

749
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:55,350
companies there's always the chance that

750
00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:56,820
they will realize that hey maybe privacy

751
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:59,730
isn't what large shareholders won

752
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:03,030
anymore it's not economically viable as

753
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:04,860
a as a selling point or marketable and

754
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:07,020
they'll flip the switch and that's

755
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:09,060
always been my concern so I can

756
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:11,310
recommend Apple right now but in the

757
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:15,440
long term we'll just that you it's just

758
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:15,440
sort of a wait-and-see sort of approach

759
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:27,629
PayPal is just not a gold mine and I

760
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:30,149
should let me preface my PayPal comments

761
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:32,009
I am overwhelmingly biased when it comes

762
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:35,879
to PayPal not necessarily because of

763
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:38,850
their business practices from a privacy

764
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:41,750
standpoint but just them as a company I

765
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:46,168
don't like them as a company they have

766
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:49,109
removed funding from privacy focused

767
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:51,270
projects and and and hackers but still

768
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:53,580
allow certain extremist groups to

769
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:55,379
receive funding they're very flaky when

770
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:59,160
it comes to that sort of stuff and I

771
00:34:55,379 --> 00:35:00,089
just don't like them so please take that

772
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,750
with a grain of salt

773
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:13,670
my private my PayPal statements are

774
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:17,660
significantly skewed yep absolutely

775
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:21,960
was it a like 300 Wilshire Boulevard

776
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:24,950
that really held nine oh two one oh and

777
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,800
then my phone number is 401 to 8 6 75

778
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:30,419
309 the presentation actually if anyone

779
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,460
wants copies of the presentation or I

780
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,190
didn't put the resource slides up long

781
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,200
enough you can find it online if you go

782
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:40,140
to my Twitter handle Timmy doomsday

783
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,330
there's a pinned tweet at the top

784
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,520
that will have slides copies of

785
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:47,880
recordings of this presentation as well

786
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,670
as actual clickable links for these

787
00:35:47,880 --> 00:36:03,660
resources

788
00:35:49,670 --> 00:36:07,170
Timmy doomsday anyone else yes there is

789
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:10,470
hope but it's difficult there is a

790
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:12,150
manual process you can go about what

791
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:14,310
winds up usually happening is the data

792
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:16,110
gets picked up by data aggregators so if

793
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:19,170
you remove the original source that

794
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:22,910
usually isn't the problem it's companies

795
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:27,390
like my life in Spokeo and you know

796
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:29,879
white pages com that yeah I have been

797
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:32,069
verified what what have you that will

798
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:35,010
scoop up that data in datasets from all

799
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:38,460
these other companies and present it

800
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:40,290
behind a paywall there are a couple

801
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,120
options you can go about manually

802
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:45,900
requesting that those sites remove it

803
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:48,150
which is a legal action you can take it

804
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,770
doesn't require a lawyer you usually

805
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:53,900
have to submit a form that will allow

806
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:57,120
you to be removed from their database

807
00:36:53,900 --> 00:37:00,360
the other option is the company that

808
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:06,630
owns blur the email masking company also

809
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:08,850
has another tool called delete me but

810
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:13,110
again it's like 200 bucks a year for one

811
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:15,720
person and they cover 30 to 50 of the

812
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:19,950
top sites I think don't quote me on that

813
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:21,629
number but that's not sort of like a

814
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:23,399
one-time fee it's not like you just pay

815
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:25,560
and all this data is gone it's gonna

816
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,810
wind up back in there again especially

817
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,270
if like you buy a home or you purchase a

818
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:32,400
vehicle there's a lot more here that you

819
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:34,170
can do to take back to privacy than just

820
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,290
this that's sort of outside the scope of

821
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:40,710
this talk you probably noticed like

822
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:42,180
email or like my home address we didn't

823
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:44,100
cover that Amazon has to send them as

824
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:47,580
packages somewhere I have to give them a

825
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:49,980
home address there is a way to go about

826
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:53,009
masking your home address it involves

827
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,580
declaring digital Nomad status in the

828
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:56,160
state of

829
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:59,460
South Dakota and/or Wisconsin I think

830
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,740
it's very convoluted I haven't got it

831
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,240
figured out yet but as soon as I do I

832
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:06,770
will be certain to put together a

833
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,770
presentation on that whole process

834
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,120
problem with the PIO box is they

835
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:18,750
required your actual name and address as

836
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:20,430
listed on your driver's license if you

837
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:24,870
declare digital nomads that if you can

838
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:27,509
actually put the digital nomad location

839
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:30,390
on your driver's license it does require

840
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:32,880
you to travel to South Dakota like once

841
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,560
every four years for two days so that

842
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,770
you can renew your drivers license and

843
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,390
such again outside the scope of this

844
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:42,930
talk haven't figured that out can't

845
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:44,339
speak to it with any veracity but it's

846
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,080
definitely something like that's

847
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:55,200
definitely an option there are ways to

848
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:58,350
go about that that is an option so

849
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,689
you're able to create you are able to

850
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:02,370
create an LLC they do require your

851
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:05,370
actual information but they just don't

852
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:07,470
publicly put it out there I think it's

853
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:09,990
like New Mexico or Arizona is one of the

854
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:12,390
places I think South Dakota is also one

855
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:14,040
of those places the problem is they

856
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:17,580
still when you sign up for a few bucks

857
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:20,160
require every name of every recipient

858
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:23,790
that will be receiving mail at that

859
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:26,129
address because if you for example if

860
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:28,650
like I went and signed up with one today

861
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:32,220
as Timmy doomsday right and something

862
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:35,790
came for John Doe they'd kick it back

863
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:37,770
they would not know whereas like if I

864
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,720
had something in the name of John Doe

865
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:43,190
delivered to my house that they don't

866
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,189
care they're just going to deliver it

867
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:53,420
correct my problem with the hubs and

868
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:56,640
locations is that there are cameras

869
00:39:53,420 --> 00:40:00,479
usually in those hubs and locations

870
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:03,328
right I don't want people knowing where

871
00:40:00,479 --> 00:40:07,140
I'm picking up stuff and a lot of that

872
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:10,170
closed-circuit TV camera stuff which

873
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:12,269
used to just be erased after 30 days

874
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:15,660
right you could just wait 30 days and

875
00:40:12,269 --> 00:40:17,430
now before you go back somewhere with

876
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,199
the advances in storage technology I

877
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:23,160
have it on very good authority from

878
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:26,519
certain big-box retailers and a pharmacy

879
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:29,729
IT staff that that information is just

880
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:31,439
kept long-term like they don't plan on

881
00:40:29,729 --> 00:40:34,680
deleting that anytime soon because

882
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,199
storage is so cheap at this point so

883
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:39,479
that sort of throat now it depends on

884
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:41,160
your threat model I do want to prep I do

885
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:43,169
want to say that all of this depends on

886
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,390
your threat model if you are targeted by

887
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:49,380
I don't know like say a three-letter

888
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:51,660
agency one don't talk to me I don't need

889
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,940
that kind of heat in my life

890
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:56,069
but to that you're that blows all of

891
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,410
this away you're done like that's I

892
00:40:56,069 --> 00:41:02,640
cannot help you this will not help you

893
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:05,699
you need like spycraft level stuff that

894
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,499
like borders on illegal like you've got

895
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:10,440
none of this involves like creating fake

896
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:12,689
IDs or forging government documents this

897
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,910
is just like lying the big corporations

898
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:16,949
right which you should all do I'm

899
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:24,739
totally about lying to big box

900
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:24,739
corporations anyone else one more

901
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:33,840
yes correct

902
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:45,550
she'll be able to feed the kids because

903
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:51,610
there's an there's cash stashed in the

904
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:54,280
walls and she does know where that is

905
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:55,810
but that is it that is a huge gap in all

906
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,750
of this is that it doesn't account for

907
00:41:55,810 --> 00:42:01,570
other people you know like and that is a

908
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:03,700
big concern I would say if you were go

909
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:05,440
if you're going to go about all of this

910
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,609
number there's a privacy fatigue and

911
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,100
there's a lot of work that you have to

912
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:11,290
do in addition to just covering yourself

913
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:16,150
you need to worry about your significant

914
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:18,430
other and explaining to them why you're

915
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:26,290
doing all of this stuff and what's going

916
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:31,060
on fortunately my wife is understanding

917
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:33,370
I guess would be the right word yeah she

918
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:36,400
yes she lets me get away with a lot you

919
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:40,180
know so she was fine with me standing up

920
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:43,570
a server rack in the garage fun fact if

921
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:46,330
a server rack is 6 feet tall it is not

922
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:50,500
six feet diagonal and you will ruin the

923
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:51,270
top of your garage I say that from

924
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,380
experience

925
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:56,140
but it is a conversation you need to

926
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:59,980
have absolutely and what I've actually

927
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:03,480
started doing is putting together sort

928
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:05,950
of a break the glass USB Drive with

929
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,410
everything on it and the only way to get

930
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:11,740
it is if I die and that requires a

931
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:13,930
really really good will honestly if you

932
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:15,819
want to dig more into that topic like

933
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:18,279
what do you do with your digital life

934
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:21,370
after you pass

935
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:25,000
Kevin Cody gave a great talk at besides

936
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:27,370
Pittsburgh this year that is online that

937
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,710
he goes into way more depth on how you

938
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:31,390
can manage a lot of this he would be a

939
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:35,370
much better resource than I am at this

940
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:35,370
point yes

941
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:50,830
oh no no no no listen my wife has a very

942
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,839
much has a choice and it's all about

943
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:55,990
give and take what I worry with my wife

944
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:59,140
and my loved ones is harm-reduction

945
00:43:55,990 --> 00:44:00,459
right I'm not gonna have them there's no

946
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:03,129
way I'm gonna be able to have them put

947
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:06,940
on the tinfoil hat all I can do is hope

948
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:09,670
that I make them more aware you know but

949
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:13,450
prying Instagram and snapchat off of my

950
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:14,050
wife I'm not gonna happen not gonna

951
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,299
happen

952
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:19,920
there will be divorced before Instagram

953
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,920
goes away I promise you that

954
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:34,300
yes I could no it's not a stupid

955
00:44:32,349 --> 00:44:37,030
question at all it's not a stupid

956
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:39,579
question at all I could get them in her

957
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:42,040
name however that could still be tied

958
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:44,859
but right now nothing is in any of our

959
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:48,720
games so none of that can really get

960
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:52,390
tied back to my personal address right

961
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:55,959
if I put it in her name now people will

962
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:58,420
know who lives in my home and then

963
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:01,980
they'll be able to tie me to my wife and

964
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:05,560
my wife to my location that makes sense

965
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:09,190
that is why nothing is in either of our

966
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:11,529
names well actually that's all the

967
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:13,420
mortgage so them this is where it gets

968
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:16,150
confusing and why my wife is a patient

969
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:21,579
woman mortgage is in a trust that's

970
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:28,140
entitled to an LLC remember what I said

971
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:30,099
if I die things will go south quickly I

972
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:32,140
think I have time for one more question

973
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:34,359
than if anyone wants to chat after this

974
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:36,640
I'll be outside I'll hang out all day

975
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:38,500
you know you guys can you guys can

976
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:41,609
pester me with questions I'm happy happy

977
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,609
to answer them last one

978
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:54,890
fortunately I don't have that problem

979
00:45:52,569 --> 00:45:57,410
what I because I don't like people

980
00:45:54,890 --> 00:46:03,230
taking pictures of me what I will say I
