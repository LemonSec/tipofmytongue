it's a wonderful weekend so what is

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,020
hacker con at security who puts it on

18
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,549
well we're the three or four geeks

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,890
anyone that's wearing one of these

20
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,460
shirts is a board member and then we

21
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,630
also have some staff that are wearing it

22
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,389
three or four geeks are the geeks that

23
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:25,649
live in West Virginia area code used to

24
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,789
be 304 so it's not anymore it's like you

25
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:31,070
know we don't want to change a name

26
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:33,600
it took us enough to get the all that so

27
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:36,178
so who are the three or four geeks

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,928
initially it was a few folks got

29
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:42,179
together they went to Louisville for

30
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:44,369
what was called the Louisville medicine

31
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:46,829
elite class that as they were driving

32
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:50,880
home from that which ended up becoming

33
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:53,068
Derby con after we started they said hey

34
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,850
we can put on a conference so they

35
00:01:53,069 --> 00:02:02,700
created hacker con and then things got a

36
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:06,749
little out of hand and see I I did add a

37
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,940
couple more slides so we actually do a

38
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:12,359
lot of things we've always said for

39
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,190
years you know we do things well last

40
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,160
year someone pointed out you don't tell

41
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,290
us what you do so we actually

42
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,490
participate in a Charleston lug for

43
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,130
those that don't know it's a Linux user

44
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:27,160
group that is sponsored by

45
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,600
Red Hat and I think they spawn through

46
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,930
the lug I don't know I don't know

47
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,410
anymore

48
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,000
it changes hands so we also go to a

49
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,190
security Roundtable

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,600
that you know we have that a few times

51
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:43,690
and we also go to somebody in this room

52
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,210
has a thing called the PMD weekly

53
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:48,760
meetups and that is that stands for a

54
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,800
practical network defense because the

55
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,130
person whose conference room were using

56
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,530
didn't want us to call us hackers so we

57
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:59,410
also teach local cybersecurity classes

58
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:03,160
around the state some of us live in

59
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:06,820
Fairmont and we do stuff up there we

60
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:10,870
also put on hacker con so what is

61
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:15,340
secured obv a few years ago we decided

62
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:18,400
to yeah five years ago so technically

63
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:22,030
this is hacker content and secured to be

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,480
v5 five years ago we decided to change

65
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,760
the name because people didn't like you

66
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,649
know the businesses wouldn't pay for

67
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,190
them to go for something called hacker

68
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:36,070
on so we changed it we tried to make it

69
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:40,690
more of a general theme hate mail poured

70
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:43,239
in so we changed we went back to Friday

71
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:46,180

74
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:56,590
general topic you know more business

75
00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:00,399

76
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,930

77

233
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:39,690
housekeeping if you brought your work

234
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:43,790
laptop and you're on the CTF Network

235
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:48,090
you're doing it wrong if you brought a

236
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:51,030
standard a standard Cali install and

237
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:53,730
you're on the CTF CTF network or any

238
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:56,520
network really and you didn't change it

239
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:58,160
from tor you're doing it wrong and we

240
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:02,060

241
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:05,040

242
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:07,410
guarantee you it will have a different

243
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,760
password it might actually have some

244
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:14,930
pictures on it you don't want to see

245

248
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,410
you've never done something before how

249
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,660
many people have soldered ok Wow

257
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:55,620
if you've never done anything like this

258
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:57,180
you know if you if you go to a talk and

259
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:02,089
you've never talked to the speaker

260
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:05,849
afterwards go talk to him whoever it is

261
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:08,040

262

270
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:38,490

271
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:41,579

coming after you yes I'm a limp a little

273
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:48,660
bit but I can't hurt people kind of I'm

274
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:52,850
very very hurtful um don't be a jerk

275
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,850
about it be mindful of your surroundings

276
00:14:54,290 --> 00:15:00,300
not even getting a grin out of these

277
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,670
people come on if you are being a jerk

278
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,410
or doing something illegal we're gonna

279
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,329
ask you to leave and we're not going to

280
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,500
refund your money and you're just kind

281
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:09,899
of leave and you probably won't be

282
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,709
coming back for a while yes we have had

283
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:16,529

those that pre-order the t-shirts if you

309
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:31,200
haven't bought a t-shirt and you would

310
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,279
like to buy a t-shirt I think they're 25

311
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,279
bucks I honestly don't

312
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:39,360
I'm just the president they don't tell

313
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,969
me anything I'm just doing this because

314
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:47,820
no one else wants to do this that sounds

315
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:51,930
about right yeah yeah they are now for a

316
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:55,470
limited time only they're $25 and for

317
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:59,339
everyone in this room there are $25 so

318
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:00,089
okay yeah this is all wrong because well

319
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,570
we're not doing anymore

320
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:05,069
now we do have the secure WV I believe

321
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,290
is the Wi-Fi there should not be a

322
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:10,530
password on it so if you want to get on

323
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:15,000
it that's fine if you don't have a VPN

324
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:18,300
