1
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,930
hmm hey

2
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:22,009
we all set Oh Oh God

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,630
okay well first of all good afternoon

4
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,910
everybody

5
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,860
thanks for coming honestly appreciate

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,510
that first time speaking at this

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,160
conference but I've heard a lot of

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,520
really good things about it so how is

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,970
the conference treating y'all so far

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:43,220
sweet okay I will say this I came in

11
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:44,900
from Florida for the weather and man let

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,640
me tell you I'm freezing up here right

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,050
now like I'm well insulated and I'm

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,330
still freezing pretty good right now so

15
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,830
this is pretty interesting for me but I

16
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,809
did have some practice I just came out

17
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:56,780
of Pennsylvania and last week I went to

18
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:58,970
Chicago which was hell so thank you for

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,010
at least not being that bad I'm gonna

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:05,390
warn you right now this talk is very

21
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:07,369
blue in nature I am a blue side guy for

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,310
the most part in other words defensive

23
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:12,049
okay and the reason I came up with this

24
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:15,530
talk is I've been doing this for a while

25
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:17,060
now I've been an IT insecurity I'll

26
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,409
throw that up there in a minute but I've

27
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,890
been doing this for a long time now and

28
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:25,100
what I found is over the years we have

29
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:27,200
really started moving towards technical

30
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,630
solutions for things and blinky boxes

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,399
which I totally understand I love it

32
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,399
I honestly in a place that I used to

33
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:36,020
work we had this beautiful switch that I

34
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:37,820
would go in and turn off the lights in

35
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,920
the server room just to watch the lights

36
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:43,100
blink I kid you not it was absolutely

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,439
beautiful to watch that right but we've

38
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:49,428
been transfixed by that in many cases

39
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,529
were pulled into that and now we're just

40
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:53,659
used to throwing up more technology the

41
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,719
problem is some of the foundational

42
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:59,990
things in organizations are not getting

43
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,818
done and part of that is the technology

44
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,770
pieces are out there part of that is

45
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:05,929
we're seeing a lot of growth in

46
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,149
organizations and so somebody starts off

47
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:12,290
very small and it's okay to have a small

48
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:14,150
network flat network but within about 2

49
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,859
or 3 years you're so busy running around

50
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,690
trying to do this other stuff now you've

51
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,400
got a pretty decent-sized network and

52
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,079
it's still dead flat that's one of the

53
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,460
things we'll talk about here that means

54
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,709
everything can talk to everything else

55
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,120
that's a problem and it's getting away

56
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:27,890
from us but we keep putting technology

57
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,819
in place to try to fix these problems

58
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,849
that found

59
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:33,589
additionally are still an issue out

60
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:34,959
there and so that's what I'm covering

61
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,909
today is a lot of the foundational

62
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,349
things that are getting missed in

63
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:42,709
organizations that I've seen throughout

64
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:45,010
my career so that being said the

65
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:48,319
good-looking guy in the screen that's me

66
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:50,689
so Eric Crone is my name I work with no

67
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,319
before again out of Florida my

68
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:53,030
background

69
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:56,328
first of all do we have any CIS ESPYs in

70
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,980
here okay we got a couple there was an

71
00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:00,560
email came out a few years ago said your

72
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,388
annual minimum CPEs are gonna go to 40

73
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,650
per year my name was at the bottom of

74
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:05,650
that be gentle

75
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:31,240
oh great so you have a lot of time with

76
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:32,770
my mouth moving and no sound so

77
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,050
principle of least privilege is very

78
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:37,620
very similar to the same only it's

79
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:40,810
taking the rights that people have and

80
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:42,520
limiting what they can get to so how

81
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:44,770
many of you and your organization's have

82
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,030
like a shared drive like an S Drive or

83
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,970
something like that right wherever and

84
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:52,149
dumps files okay lots of people do that

85
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:54,040
well again not to pick on receptionist

86
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:56,280
but does your receptionist have access

87
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,920
to write to the accounting drive

88
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:04,270
possibly do you know what people have

89
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:05,710
the rights to write to so going back to

90
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,210
ransomware Fran somewhere hits it

91
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,880
usually launches in the context of the

92
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:11,830
user they launched it if they cannot

93
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:15,400
write to the file they cannot encrypt

94
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:16,899
the file that makes a big difference

95
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,390
right there but far too often we add

96
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,640
users we're just like okay cool cool

97
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:24,970
cool now when I was with the army one of

98
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:28,660
my projects was to help with role based

99
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:31,450
access control it's it's basically hell

100
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:32,830
in a project okay you're trying to

101
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:35,940
figure out what all these people's roles

102
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:38,290
are but here's the problem we had there

103
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,570
people would move from department to

104
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:41,889
department okay and what happens when

105
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:44,020
this happened this happens in the real

106
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:46,030
world two people go from one role to

107
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,070
another or one department to another you

108
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,480
add their permissions to that but very

109
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:52,330
rarely do you know what the hell to take

110
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,620
away and so these people are running

111
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,060
around how many of you have ever had an

112
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:59,729
account you're like I can still get into

113
00:31:55,060 --> 00:32:02,350
that right oh I have that perpetuates

114
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:04,150
you loose can track you lose track of it

115
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,949
you lose control over it and now you

116
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:08,830
have somebody who gets hit by something

117
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:10,450
or they get fish somebody goes in and

118
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:12,730
now they have access to their box now

119
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:15,910
they have those permissions to start

120
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:18,970
moving around on the network and that's

121
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:21,310
really really dangerous stuff pretty

122
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,170
much all the tools are already there we

123
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:27,010
don't have to buy more stuff to put this

124
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:29,230
stuff in place it's a matter of focusing

125
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,610
on setting it up that way and in all

126
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:32,680
these things that I'm talking about here

127
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm not suggesting you go out and you

128
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,770
start ripping wires out of the switch

129
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,020
and go okay we're gonna segment today or

130
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:39,670
gonna fix this today all right these are

131
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,860
things that you can start to roll out as

132
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:45,010
you continue to roll things out in the

133
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:47,429
future start having a plan for the new

134
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:50,080
things are going in this area here and

135
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:52,030
then you start moving things in take

136
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,590
your time and do this I'm not saying

137
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:56,230
that you want to do it you know by

138
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:58,419
Wednesday but we've got to have this

139
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:59,920
thoughts and we've got to be considering

140
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,600
this we have to have more of these talks

141
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,300
with people about dealing with the

142
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,419
fundamentals that's what this is about

143
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:09,370
right 74 percent of IT decision makers

144
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,870
surveyed whose organizations have been

145
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:15,239
breached in the past say it involved

146
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:15,239
privileged access credential abuse

147
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:23,200
that's brutal what are you doing to

148
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:25,720
protect those accounts who has access to

149
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,030
them if their key accounts do you have

150
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,280
multi-factor authentication on now MFA

151
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:33,940
can be bypassed my colleague Roger

152
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:36,340
Grimes he loves to because I'm a big MFA

153
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,140
junkie and he loves to poke ways at me

154
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:41,110
he's like I think I have 31 ways to

155
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:43,600
bypass MFA now and I'm like yeah and a

156
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:46,149
lot of them are human based right you

157
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,500
get the text message and you know you

158
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:49,990
have to put that in well they have

159
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,150
attacks where they pretend to be a bank

160
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:53,950
and they tax they say hey we're beta

161
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:55,180
testing or we're testing a new security

162
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,290
system we want to make sure this works

163
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,970
they already have your username and

164
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,710
password so what do they do they put it

165
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,480
in and say okay now you should have

166
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,860
gotten a text from the new system please

167
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,960
help us out by telling us what the

168
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,850
number is that we just sent you here we

169
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,340
go hey cool I'm helping out they give me

170
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:13,630
the number and bam right in through the

171
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:17,200
MFA that's a human attack but it's

172
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:20,070
bypassing MFA right but it's better than

173
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:23,350
nothing so if your organization has

174
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:25,360
social media accounts have you ever

175
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:27,520
thought about protecting those what

176
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,320
those can do anyone here remember when

177
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,780
The Associated Press Twitter account got

178
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,640
got breached number of years back and

179
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:35,230
they turned around and they said oh

180
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:37,000
there was a explosions in the White

181
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:40,149
House not sure what's going on with the

182
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,489
president I have a slide for some MFA

183
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:45,790
talks I do you can see when that tweet

184
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:49,439
came out and the the stock market price

185
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:52,949
went ding right at that moment okay in

186
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,859
Tampa the the mayor of Tampa had his

187
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:59,069
Twitter account hacked in other words

188
00:34:55,859 --> 00:35:02,098
somebody got the credentials and posted

189
00:34:59,069 --> 00:35:05,220
all kinds of just crazy crazy crap

190
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:07,829
overnight one day now it was so far over

191
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:10,500
the top that it was everyone's like okay

192
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:12,210
we see what happened but imagine in your

193
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,630
organization if somebody does that sort

194
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,730
of thing

195
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:16,980
your reputation is built a lot on those

196
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,690
sorts of things and it can come back and

197
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,990
bite you pretty hard so protect those

198
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:23,609
accounts to know who has access to those

199
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:25,618
so you don't just keep adding people to

200
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:27,150
having access to those of course you

201
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:29,579
probably just share one account with

202
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:31,140
with the same female anyways right write

203
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:37,410
it down put it under the keyboard it's

204
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:43,020
all good we all do that right what's

205
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:45,000
that Oh like like Hawaii did right you

206
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:47,099
all remember that when Hawaii had that

207
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,359
missile scare that happened and then

208
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:51,510
they come in and they do the the the

209
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:53,130
news segment on it and the guys sitting

210
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:57,500
there and the password for the system

211
00:35:53,130 --> 00:36:01,859
was on a post-it note on the monitor

212
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:05,130
seriously right it doesn't matter if you

213
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:07,109
have a 42 character password with no

214
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:10,170
repeating digits and I don't know how

215
00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:11,549
that's possible but I'm sure it is it

216
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,869
doesn't matter if you're gonna put on a

217
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:15,900
post-it note and stick it on the damn

218
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:18,390
monitor right these things happen but

219
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,369
again when it comes to this sort of

220
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:22,410
things protect your accounts protect

221
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:25,380
what's going on with these sorts of

222
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:27,750
things and make sure that you know who

223
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:30,480
has permissions to what it does require

224
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:32,579
auditing it requires going in and

225
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,440
looking at this like I said I rolled out

226
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:36,690
role base access for my army

227
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,480
organization was about 300 something

228
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:41,609
people that were all IT people we all

229
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,990
bounced around all over the place you

230
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:45,779
wouldn't believe some of the permissions

231
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:48,029
I turned up in some of this stuff we

232
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,500
need to take some time and do that we

233
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:56,550
already have the tools we just need to

234
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:57,780
do the time oh I think you guys kind of

235
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,180
understand my feeling on this one

236
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:02,430
already okay

237
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:07,098
I love RDP

238
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:10,109
I use RDP all the time but I VPN first

239
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:13,260
RDP is just the problem isn't

240
00:37:10,109 --> 00:37:15,660
necessarily with RDP itself but most of

241
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,809
the implementations of RDP are sloppy

242
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:21,868
okay sometimes people will move it from

243
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:26,549
port 3389 to 3390 and they're like yes

244
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:28,650
no one's ever gonna find that that

245
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:32,460
doesn't work folks if you think if you

246
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:33,750
didn't know gathered on the response the

247
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,589
other thing that happens though is you

248
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,599
put something out there that's

249
00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:39,808
internet-facing and a lot of times they

250
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:41,130
don't do good lockout policies so what

251
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:42,029
are you doing you just sit there and hey

252
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:43,619
it's on the Internet

253
00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:45,119
I'll throw some credentials at it every

254
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:47,369
you know four or five minutes see what

255
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,740
happens just run a script that does that

256
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:51,359
until he goes hey you're in right if

257
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:54,419
we're not watching for that if we're not

258
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:56,730
monitoring heavily on accounts that are

259
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,200
internet facing that's a problem but RDP

260
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:00,029
is just once you're in that machine

261
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,230
you're in the machine and then the you

262
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:01,770
know the game is pretty much over at

263
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:05,970
that point

264
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:09,930
my recommendation is what I've seen work

265
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:12,470
better is use a VPN first VPN into

266
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:15,029
something VPN into a safe Network

267
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:17,700
probably not directly into the corporate

268
00:38:15,029 --> 00:38:20,789
network I'm just not a fan of that and

269
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:22,828
use a jump box another an RDP session in

270
00:38:20,789 --> 00:38:26,490
there that you can get to that has your

271
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:28,799
tools on it I'm a big let's not go

272
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:31,140
straight to your actual real box from

273
00:38:28,799 --> 00:38:33,720
the internet sort of guy but if you're

274
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:36,118
gonna do it monitor the hell out of it

275
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,189
make sure you understand what's going on

276
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:40,730
make sure you have some DLP in place to

277
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:43,770
watch for data leaving your network

278
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:45,539
through that you know if your user all

279
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:47,009
of a sudden starts pulling you know 50

280
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:50,069
Meg's a second out for sustained periods

281
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:51,690
of like three days you should probably

282
00:38:50,069 --> 00:38:54,480
be spotting that but a lot of people

283
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,799
aren't looking for that so data gets

284
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,000
actual traded out of some of these airs

285
00:38:55,799 --> 00:39:01,410
but again look for these things make

286
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,089
sure that you're monitoring these if you

287
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:05,848
have them but the easiest way to do it

288
00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:08,400
is just remove it Sam Sam is a group

289
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:10,440
that's been doing ransomware they're

290
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,130
fantastic it's just blowing through this

291
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:16,280
sort of thing they find unsecured RDP

292
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:20,730
and they're in it and notes

293
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:23,820
so finally everyone's favorite keep up

294
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:26,700
with patches we all love patching right

295
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:28,580
who here has a a primary or a

296
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,350
significant duty that involves patching

297
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:34,920
show of hands funk you poor bastards man

298
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:38,040
I'm yeah well the thing about patching

299
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:42,540
is man it is tough it is absolutely

300
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:45,600
tough no doubt about it where I see us

301
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:50,240
trip up on patching sometimes is we

302
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:52,950
we're patching the wrong things okay and

303
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,660
where this falls into play is I see a

304
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:56,970
lot of people break-in their necks to

305
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:59,819
patch a bunch of things that don't have

306
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:01,230
an active exploit with them yet and in

307
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:03,330
the meantime they're ignoring other

308
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:06,030
things that could be a bigger deal now

309
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:08,310
you want to keep that on the list but a

310
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:10,200
lot of times people do the wrong things

311
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:12,390
I also coming out of medical this is a

312
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:15,870
phenomenon that I saw a lot in medical

313
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:17,940
is you have a device say an MRI machine

314
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:19,589
that's fantastic it does great imaging

315
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,060
the doctors are familiar with it they're

316
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:23,550
used to looking at it they can spot

317
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:25,230
cancer and a in a in a fly you know I

318
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:27,240
mean it it's so precise they can see

319
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:31,610
everything they need and it's running on

320
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:34,470
Windows Vista okay so what do you do

321
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:36,510
alright the manufacturer possibly has

322
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:38,609
been acquired four or five times by now

323
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:40,710
in the last year because that's how a

324
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:42,300
medical stuff works they're never gonna

325
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,650
be a patch for this machine so what do

326
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:47,850
you do you put it in its own little area

327
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:49,830
and you you ignore it from patching well

328
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,970
all of your other patched stuff is

329
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:53,040
running around this machine in the

330
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:57,810
meantime some of these patches don't

331
00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:00,000
require Microsoft bundled things it's

332
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:04,970
fixing certain things maybe turning off

333
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:07,950
a certain version of you know of SMB or

334
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:09,750
something like that right you still need

335
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:11,819
to keep that on your list of things to

336
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,860
look at so when these vulnerabilities do

337
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:17,190
roll out you need to understand hey I

338
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:19,380
need to fix this or maybe maybe you turn

339
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:21,210
off file-sharing on that thing a little

340
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:23,610
bit as these come out but a lot of times

341
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:25,170
people will just patch and think that

342
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:27,270
they're good but that's not the end of

343
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:29,490
it right or they spend all over their

344
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:30,810
effort patching

345
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:34,799
some new vulnerability that it has a

346
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:38,730
cool-ass logo sorry has a very cool logo

347
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,080
and and such and that's not their threat

348
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,490
right so they're working on their

349
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,590
windows boxes when they're Linux

350
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:46,140
machines are over here they were on a

351
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:46,920
shop that has 99% Linux machines but

352
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:49,680
they're gonna spend all their time

353
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:52,830
trying to patch the one Windows box is

354
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:55,890
that really your threat so patching is

355
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:58,350
not easy but it is something we have to

356
00:41:55,890 --> 00:42:00,540
do and I will say this we got a pretty

357
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:02,190
good way of running through this

358
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:04,440
coordinating with other people in the

359
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:05,940
army in the beginning when we did

360
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,640
patching we did a lot of this

361
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,110
self-inflicted wound thing so like okay

362
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,180
cool we're gonna patch the domain

363
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:14,700
controllers tonight and in the meantime

364
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,890
the network team is gonna down a switch

365
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,899
as they do their patching and so halfway

366
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:20,910
through your patch it loses connections

367
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,380
and ever all hell breaks loose right we

368
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:25,529
got really good at doing that to

369
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:29,369
ourselves until we started coordinating

370
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:31,800
with each other on that and honestly it

371
00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:34,830
actually got pretty easy once we stopped

372
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,220
stepping in our own stuff so you can do

373
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:37,230
it

374
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,839
think about it though and we got to put

375
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:41,850
some effort into doing that so in

376
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,530
summary usually a lot of ways to improve

377
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:46,830
security without adding additional

378
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:48,420
technology it's always fun to have those

379
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:50,009
extra things but there's a lot of stuff

380
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,710
that we probably left behind that we

381
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:53,450
haven't done already some of these

382
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:56,460
inquire improve documentation

383
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:58,560
overhauling some processes that is fun

384
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:02,030
if you guys aren't all excited about the

385
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:06,000
idea of new policies and processes man

386
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:08,040
yeah I know it's not easy but working on

387
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,100
a strong security culture will help your

388
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,720
organization adapt to this stuff as well

389
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,549
you know like I said with the patching

390
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,419
working with other people that made a

391
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:20,160
huge difference so that being said I'm

392
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,680
bad out of time here's my info this is

393
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,390
the Twitter I use most of the time open

394
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:27,240
for any questions you have always open

395
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:33,049
to to comment anything else anyone have

396
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:33,049
any questions okay Oh

397
00:43:50,490 --> 00:44:14,709
Yeah right right it's all numbers yeah

398
00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:16,840
yeah yeah so and I'm not just trying to

399
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:19,060
plug a colleague of mine I work with a

400
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,950
guy named Roger Grimes and Roger is a

401
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:23,860
very very smart guy he wrote a book

402
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:25,750
called data-driven defense and so what

403
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:27,760
you do is for Christmas you drop that on

404
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:30,040
your executive on your boss's desk or

405
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,500
whatever with a little bow on it it

406
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,690
actually focuses a lot on where are my

407
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,550
real problems here what do I need to be

408
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:38,110
focusing on and it lays it out in a way

409
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:41,470
that is very helpful with that because

410
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:42,700
when you're patching for compliance just

411
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,649
like anything else you're doing for

412
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,990
compliance it's different than patching

413
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:49,270
for security and so if you're just going

414
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:51,220
this many came out this many CVS came

415
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:53,710
out this many patches came out we need

416
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:56,230
to get this many out that is not an

417
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:58,930
effective way of actually working with

418
00:44:56,230 --> 00:45:01,540
your risk and so I highly recommend his

419
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:03,970
book it's not a very long read but it's

420
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:06,660
really eye-opening in the simplicity

421
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:08,770
you'll read it and be like well yeah duh

422
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:11,080
but he puts it out in such a way that

423
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:13,180
it's good for leadership to be able to

424
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,950
understand those principles then and be

425
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:18,580
able to focus on the things that are not

426
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:22,930
compliance it's called a data-driven

427
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:25,060
defense so yeah it's it's just a nice

428
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:26,410
way to look at that so all right

429
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:27,810
appreciate it thank you everyone

430
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:33,578
thank you

431
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:33,578
[Applause]

432
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:40,549
you
