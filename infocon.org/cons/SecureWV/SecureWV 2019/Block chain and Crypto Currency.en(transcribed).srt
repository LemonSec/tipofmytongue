1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:18,140
just yeah it's really good that you guys

2
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:24,619
aren't government because I got

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:26,240
generated so um yeah so this is the

4
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:28,160
undergrad program I was talking to you

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,439
about that's all I just spent online

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,960
five certifications come out of that one

7
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:36,260
right and then this is the master's

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,500
program there are ten courses in that

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:42,739
and then that's the kinda more

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:46,879
leadership managerial driven so you have

11
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:54,530
those already so pass the word on it

12
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:57,550
again yeah for both of them undergrad

13
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:00,289
and grad we need one hour a week

14
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:03,620
synchronously like on a WebEx at night

15
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:06,310
everybody works during the day but the

16
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,330
rest is 18

17
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:12,440
like I said been going on three years

18
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:15,679
doing okay so this was the proposed

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:22,520
agenda but you can go wherever you want

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:23,170
or three your person fee so yeah yes yes

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,240
thank you

22
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:29,300
put that on my evaluation speaks for it

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,310
no these are the the areas I'll be

24
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,390
covering and again I can kind of go over

25
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,620
which whichever direction you want

26
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,750
regarding blockchain and cryptocurrency

27
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,090
so this is actually gonna go more on the

28
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:44,210
blockchain five in crypto but I'll

29
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:48,290
definitely discuss script attitude so

30
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:52,309
this has been was generated as a result

31
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:55,070
of Pentagon I got a call thing we want

32
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,110
you to come speak on this and that's how

33
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:00,919
this came about so the version you're

34
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:02,450
getting is an unclassified level but if

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,730
these two have security clearance hold

36
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:10,060
invited you get a clearance yeah yeah

37
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,060
security clearance

38
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,230
no they don't no forget it forget it

39
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:29,970
yeah I got it I got hear you loud and

40
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:29,970
clear holding we are all good here

41
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,550
that's how this came about but this came

42
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:42,190
about back in January with the air force

43
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:45,610
command for obvious reasons getting

44
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:49,090
deeper in the block painting photos so I

45
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:52,390
would say of the branches Air Force

46
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:56,349
is probably leading in this area but in

47
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:59,410
crypto kind of followed by the other non

48
00:02:56,349 --> 00:03:03,459
DoD federal agencies which I'll go over

49
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:06,310
- so if you know anything about

50
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:08,170
blockchain then you know it's it's known

51
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,950
as the trusted protocol because it's

52
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:14,980
called trust list so meaning on the

53
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:18,369
blockchain which is an effort we want to

54
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:21,340
conduct a transaction I don't have to

55
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,500
send money from PayPal you get on PayPal

56
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,700
we both trust PayPal kind of thing you

57
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,019
know

58
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,640
instead we can do something on the

59
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:30,640
blockchain you don't have to have that

60
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,190
middle intermediary and instead though

61
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,319
connection the connection so to speak

62
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,359
and so there's no middleman to trust for

63
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:43,000
the speed we will trust each other and

64
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:45,400
I'll explain that a bit more so I know

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,540
your all's position so you can tell me

66
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:56,799
what's your knowledge on blockchain

67
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:58,959
crypto all right cool so this is a

68
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,819
high-level view just to keep us all on

69
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,150
the same page regarding blockchain

70
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:05,888
so if person a in the upper left corner

71
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,799
like what their laptop wants to buy

72
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:10,600
something from person B and you we

73
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,150
decide together we're going to get on

74
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,709
this one block thing right so we're not

75
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,358
gonna get on that blockchain when I can

76
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:19,798
get on that black thing over there we're

77
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:23,440
gonna get on this one together a

78
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:25,030
transaction will occur like I'll put a

79
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,580
service out there

80
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,260
things that need to be solved you come

81
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,900
about and say I can solve it how much

82
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,840
you willing to give as a results a block

83
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,210
is created that's a transaction it gets

84
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,650
added to the chain from now there is a

85
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,299
block in the chains of all the

86
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,929
transactions occurring on the block

87
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:46,210
things I get what I want you get paid so

88
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,200
to speak and that's how we work on this

89
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,049
one blockchain

90
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,729
so if I could put it in other language

91
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,410
terms you know if I wanted to put

92
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,660
something on Craigslist West Virginia

93
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,430
there's a blockchain I'm not gonna put

94
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,840
on Craigslist text with an apparent

95
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,140
Caliphate we're gonna go on this block

96
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,460
things right not some other so you just

97
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:11,110
have to decide which one you want to go

98
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:14,349
on the application behind it is what's

99
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:17,470
known as smart contracts so a smart

100
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,240
contract is written slash developed to

101
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,930
where we come to an agreement last

102
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,480
strike price last date on how much when

103
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,880
something's gonna be delivered to the

104
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,530
degree and that's our agreement is based

105
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,750
on the smart contract right and that's

106
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,909
between us it's private no one else on

107
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,790
the blockchain can see what we're

108
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:39,010
agreeing to however everyone else on the

109
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,770
blockchain can't see us they know we

110
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,750
exist on the block Kenny but they just

111
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:46,060
don't know how a conducting business so

112
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,860
to speak right that's the smart contract

113
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,850
that gets generated so that's basically

114
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:55,090
code it's code that's written that the

115
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:57,550
API format for example that we develop

116
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:00,190
and we come to some kind of consensus as

117
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:02,800
what's known as on the blockchain right

118
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:05,200
so you have the blockchain you have a

119
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,760
smart contract behind it that kind of

120
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,710
say alright this is how we're going to

121
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,490
come to an agreement and how we'll get

122
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:14,830
paid right so this is an example of an

123
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,419
actual block King this is liske this

124
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,820
block stencil disc has their own

125
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:22,049
watching and they have their own

126
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:26,050
cryptocurrency par for the course right

127
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:27,550
kind of thing like ripple has their own

128
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:31,750
blockchain and ripple has their own

129
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:35,050
currency this has their own law change

130
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:37,810
so this is a an example of multiple

131
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,030
people on one block King so each of

132
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,290
those circles kind of

133
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,270
represents a block you've got a

134
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,890
healthcare person there you've got a

135
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,780
medical person there and you've got

136
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,180
someone who needs the painter build a

137
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,440
medical building right and so there's a

138
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,310
bunch of smart contracts that are

139
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,260
written among all these various entities

140
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,300
agreements occur and what you notice is

141
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,430
that it's decentralized meaning there's

142
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,550
no one central server in the middle he's

143
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:05,500
dead we all are on this box in trusting

144
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,960
each other because we're all in this

145
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,150
chain and we trust the algorithms the

146
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,450
consensus format etcetera on this

147
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:15,969
wonderful thing Liske is getting really

148
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:20,260
popular with the healthcare industry in

149
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:23,410
terms of their popularity so if you say

150
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:26,530
well who is list how do I learn list etc

151
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:30,880
a lot of these block chains whether it's

152
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:33,840
some etherium whether it lifts ripple

153
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,840
what have you they all have their own

154
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:41,799
system development kit and a lot of its

155
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,359
based on JavaScript where they start and

156
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,400
then they take that JavaScript and maybe

157
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,810
they morph it into their own language of

158
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:52,359
three so it just depends right but liske

159
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:56,320
has their own Academy to where you

160
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:59,830
wanted to learn how to program in in a

161
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,240
list or come on this box and lt key and

162
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,400
that's par for the course now for almost

163
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,530
every block game out there they're

164
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,380
developing their own developers

165
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,849
community so to speak but this is an

166
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:14,219
example of one actually in practice

167
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:14,220
right so for the healthcare industry

168
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:30,150
absolutely absolutely would become

169
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,740
another block on the team so as long as

170
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:35,039
they have the smart contract and that

171
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,750
end then the right code downloading for

172
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,299
example thinking doing the block so it's

173
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,190
nothing that anybody has to have coding

174
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:44,490
knowledge that's a no to get on the

175
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:47,700
blocking so this is more of a practical

176
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:52,770
application as opposed to the other side

177
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:54,150
of you here mining mining crypto mining

178
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,790
cryptocurrency you know they're they're

179
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:59,310
just sucking up all kinds of computing

180
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,079
power to try to solve puzzles

181
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,469
mathematical problems and get paid for

182
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,750
it

183
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,880
for this piece right that's a bit

184
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,370
different you know here's like a more

185
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,870
real-world application and there's

186
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:14,400
plenty of them with a little better

187
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,170
so yeah we're talking about how does it

188
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,439
have this all get developed having this

189
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,969
have this all come about well like

190
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,070
everything you know it's a bunch of

191
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:26,130
hackers and people like everyone in this

192
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:28,170
conference where you know people want to

193
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,750
learn something new so you have

194
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:34,770
aetherium founders we still don't know

195
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:47,280
who bitcoin who founded bitcoin right so

196
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:50,579
she's right but where can you go to find

197
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:53,839
these people familiar with github right

198
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:58,260
github on blockchain developers on their

199
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:04,140
block tio is another one there's some

200
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:07,610
block ENCOM blockchain dot io plenty of

201
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:10,610
sources to find a community of blocking

202
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,610
developers

203
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:24,520
so who's looking at block King now it's

204
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:27,670
pretty much every industry imaginable it

205
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:30,730
started to think and look even though

206
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:33,729
the crypto side has kind of had its life

207
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,590
and you know was overpriced you know

208
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,670
Bitcoin was almost like twenty thousand

209
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:39,120
cetera that's one side of the equation

210
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,110
but in terms of the practical

211
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,390
practicalities of using block thing

212
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:46,120
might be saw like this he's using for

213
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:50,620
healthcare every industry is looking at

214
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:54,210
them so if you look at on the left side

215
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:59,280
one two three four dams the fifth one

216
00:10:54,210 --> 00:11:05,200
the bottom one energy on the right

217
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:07,209
nuclear reactors and water and waste so

218
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,340
when i briefed this at the pentagon they

219
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:16,920
really focused on those ones and the

220
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:20,980
that's all i have a clearance the

221
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:23,469
mentality was that if if we're using

222
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,840
blockchain and someone gets on the

223
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:29,370
blockchain in their their own block and

224
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:32,530
they steal blueprints for a power plant

225
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:34,150
i'm not going to go after them instead

226
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,900
we'll just keep collecting information

227
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,270
on it

228
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,579
however if we use the block thing to

229
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:43,150
destroy the power plant and they have to

230
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:45,120
show pictures then i did this just one

231
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:49,720
power plant yeah we're gonna go after

232
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,850
but that's kind of how and why DOD

233
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,900
airport excel are getting so interested

234
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:58,030
in blocking because they know that

235
00:11:52,900 --> 00:12:02,110
another way to get information out there

236
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:04,900
and you know potentially destruction

237
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,640
right lots of different ways on on how

238
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,819
block teams being used for the good and

239
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:13,030
the bad so to speak right so these are

240
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:16,990
actual examples of how governments are

241
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:19,180
using blocking in reality right now and

242
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:23,280
the kind of money they're spending on

243
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,280
them right and the billions

244
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:29,170
I was saying just based on my couple

245
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,300
several years of tracking block

246
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,819
paintings until the food industry is

247
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,229
really getting strong with it and it

248
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,830
makes sense because you know in today's

249
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:42,220
world you know how something gets from

250
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:44,590
the meat plant to the table here at chop

251
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,150
house you know go through a lot of

252
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,250
different multi networks well why not

253
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,709
tract that piece of meat on one block

254
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:53,080
chain so to speak where all of us live

255
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:56,200
and we can actually keep track and store

256
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,660
better how that piece of meat different

257
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,550
point A to point B so food food safety

258
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:04,360
is really growing strong regarding block

259
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:07,689
King and Australian as well sugar

260
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,180
production us here we're not using it

261
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:12,250
for food as much in the government we

262
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,770
using kind of more looking at it from

263
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:17,110
defense but every industry is looking at

264
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,000
a different Treasury has interested in

265
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,130
it because a crypto obviously they're

266
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,510
trying to figure out regulation policy

267
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:27,280
and crypto so there's dabbling with it I

268
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:32,710
don't know you guys have other examples

269
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:38,770
of you Berto these are kind of a more

270
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:44,760
common ways and who's really focusing on

271
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:48,400
boxing Japan legalized Bitcoin Ohio

272
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,530
became the first state to accept Bitcoin

273
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,930
for tax purposes

274
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:56,770
funky music pay your taxes and they

275
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:59,380
would have said bit going too far away

276
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:02,410
Nevada has also come in strong with

277
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,890
Bitcoin so much like everything else you

278
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:07,270
know whether it's same-sex marijuana

279
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:15,610
cryptocurrency is now also getting

280
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:26,620
regulating down by state right not there

281
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:28,290
yet yeah yeah not there yet some decent

282
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,000
examples for sure

283
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:33,520
so the point regarding how security

284
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,420
happens behind this right this is why

285
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,420
we're here at this conference

286
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:44,949
to put it in a nutshell every blockchain

287
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:47,439
and there's thousands of them typically

288
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:52,029
start with an existing security protocol

289
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:55,089
whether the md5 one of these hashes it

290
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:57,310
just depends on how they prefer the

291
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:58,920
secure and they take that security

292
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:03,699
algorithm and change it for their

293
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:05,140
specific view right the one I really

294
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,560
want to point you is the one in the

295
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:10,750
middle proof of work improve the state

296
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,630
so proof of work proof of stake or a bit

297
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:16,060
different types of consensus meaning we

298
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:18,189
have to come to an agreement on how

299
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,199
we're going to handshake and that's

300
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:24,070
known in blotchiness consensus even we

301
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,870
agree that the work I did is the work

302
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:28,360
performed and you'll pay me as a result

303
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,400
and how will agree is going to be based

304
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,050
on one of these types of hashes of

305
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,870
protocol and some derivative there oh

306
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:39,219
but these are the most common ones proof

307
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:42,820
of work is a very common one the

308
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:45,070
flipside is proof of stake I listed here

309
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,510
because it wasn't as popular with just a

310
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,060
short year ago when I presented a

311
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:52,720
Pentagon now you're the Oh poof mistakes

312
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:56,040
come even more proof of state means all

313
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,720
of us have let's just say Bitcoin right

314
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,550
but we're going to see out of out of all

315
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,140
of us who have more stake in Bitcoin

316
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:05,680
because that's probably the person we're

317
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:09,339
gonna trust more so if you have 1% 2% 3%

318
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,050
4% 5% I'm gonna trust you because you're

319
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:14,110
staking on the Bitcoin network is

320
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:16,930
stronger so I'm gonna give all more

321
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,000
computing power than you and more my

322
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,829
algorithms for you to solve because you

323
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,529
can afford it number one you've got more

324
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:26,140
Bitcoin and you've got more processing

325
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:29,170
power in that saves energy right none of

326
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,850
us are gonna compete against her and we

327
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,860
don't have to spend money to either visa

328
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:35,380
you know any of our crypto instead we'll

329
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,270
give it her and if she can solve it

330
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:40,089
great if she can't then it'll get been

331
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:43,150
passed down based on who had 4% a

332
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:46,089
Bitcoin vs. 3 so on and so forth so it

333
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:49,360
just depends on where you lie and proof

334
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:50,170
of state versus proof of work but

335
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,170
they're all kind

336
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,430
the hassles and protocols essentially

337
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:57,160
the messages none of them have to be

338
00:16:54,430 --> 00:17:01,000
redeveloped they're already there just

339
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:03,699
every every development company like a

340
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,319
list when the Sirian were who ever have

341
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:09,100
decided how they're going to create

342
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:11,409
their own consensus if Tyrion is moving

343
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:13,629
from proof of work over the proof of

344
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:18,850
State and problems will be there by the

345
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:21,579
end of this year and this one so it's

346
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:23,708
interesting time to see how the block

347
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:25,030
chains are being secured and things are

348
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:29,980
changing fast

349
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:31,600
right obviously so then how are we

350
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,190
attacked we just saw the security side

351
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,590
how are we securing so then how are

352
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:38,049
people attacking the block chains if you

353
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:43,780
look at it just from left to right rent

354
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:48,150
build bride buyout because it takes so

355
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:51,879
much power computing power and crypto

356
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:54,900
usually is a novice person will come on

357
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,580
the blockchain he's trying to attack and

358
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:01,030
they'll try to steal your computing

359
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:03,909
power and in return that in their mind

360
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:06,399
are renting it you may or may not know

361
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:08,980
they're doing it and in return they

362
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:13,840
might bribe you and say like a

363
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:16,480
ransomware concept look power back you

364
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:23,799
know pay me Bitcoin so whatever

365
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:26,380
wrong like to go down to bribe and buy

366
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:29,889
out that's expensive you almost have to

367
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:33,309
have 51% of the total blockchain control

368
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:35,610
and that's difficult to do I mean that's

369
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:38,049
like saying you're gonna have to have

370
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:40,959
5151 laptops out of a hundred

371
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:44,770
you know available to you to take over

372
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,230
one network too expensive too

373
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:49,000
time-consuming the odds of coming up

374
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:53,350
with a denial service attack or anything

375
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:57,030
or difficult to do right so the bottom

376
00:18:53,350 --> 00:19:01,330
one is a bit difficult to do because

377
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:02,918
crypto or processing power to do so but

378
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,879
to get something for a very short period

379
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:06,880
of time

380
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:09,059
certainly possible to be right all you

381
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,880
have is five Bitcoin well I'll take that

382
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:17,950
and I'll give you your power back so how

383
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:21,390
much is five Bitcoin worth now 8025 TV

384
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,390
fourth what eight thousand for Bitcoin

385
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:28,630
so easier bottom line is it's easier to

386
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,719
come on if you're a hacker and attack

387
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,640
this to come on and just try to get a

388
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,370
small piece of the block think of the

389
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,890
odds and you're never gonna get 51% I

390
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,449
mean full control cuz if I get full

391
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:45,030
control then I can write whatever

392
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:47,679
consensus algorithms I want in I control

393
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:50,200
how things are secured and not but

394
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,350
that's the whole purpose of a

395
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,549
decentralized network is that there's no

396
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,939
one central authority

397
00:19:54,549 --> 00:20:01,059
instead we're we're trustless we trust

398
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:04,470
that you're using one of those security

399
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:07,330
algorithms with me so far

400
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:09,010
practicality coming on board with it you

401
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,139
know developing it it can be used with

402
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:13,720
any kind of code language in JavaScript

403
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:18,159
like I said C sharp you know if you're

404
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:26,919
you need to select a polarity and every

405
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:31,120
other language you can imagine so how

406
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:34,830
are most people vulnerable that second

407
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:51,870
bullet is probably the AHA one that

408
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:54,549
Bitcoin alone is controlled by of that I

409
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:56,408
can then create what's called a hard

410
00:20:54,549 --> 00:21:01,539
fork or a soft board you guys familiar

411
00:20:56,409 --> 00:21:03,400
with 14 so if we're on our own

412
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:06,070
blockchain here right we trust each

413
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,169
other and I say you know what I want to

414
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:11,080
go a different route I kind of like what

415
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:13,090
we're doing here but I want to create my

416
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:17,230
own crypto I want it to look like

417
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:17,800
Bitcoin blockchain but I have a whole

418
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,600
different

419
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,270
set up security algorithms I want to do

420
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,270
and I want to start my own crypto well

421
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:29,110
I'll create a hard fork right and I'll

422
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:32,379
call it Bitcoin XYZ and anyone else who

423
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:34,870
I can get to think like me trust me use

424
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:37,360
my algorithm guess what we can create

425
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:40,719
our own blockchain and it just starts

426
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:44,020
like that right and so now you have your

427
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,750
own blockchain so to speak of course

428
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:49,510
you've gotta manage it to a degree but

429
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:51,790
you know hard work certainly possible so

430
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:53,850
that double spending there 51% of a

431
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:56,649
vulnerability to double spending some

432
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:59,320
hackers will create a heart fork to make

433
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,180
it look like you're on this blockchain

434
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,950
that you're really over here on this

435
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,510
block chain and they'll make it look and

436
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,420
seem like you're here that you're really

437
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:08,830
over to you and so when they start their

438
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,800
smart contracts like we talked about

439
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:14,860
earlier and you start spending money on

440
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:18,070
solving problems or whatever you're

441
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,990
likely going to be giving them money as

442
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:22,899
well as a person who you thought you

443
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:26,140
were gonna give money to so forking is a

444
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:30,970
is an interesting concept some are real

445
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:33,160
some are not real so to speak in this

446
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:36,900
example like Bitcoin cash Israel I think

447
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:40,180
the clean path is now the fourth largest

448
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:44,860
crypto now I mean it was a hard fork and

449
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:47,170
it's come on strong but they're

450
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:50,439
different ways to to create

451
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:51,910
vulnerabilities on on a blockchain so

452
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,640
like any other network because that's

453
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:56,770
all blockchain is is a big network it's

454
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,180
vulnerable right even though it's

455
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:01,540
decentralized it does have a

456
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:04,540
vulnerability and the less computing

457
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,970
power you have the weaker you are on

458
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:11,290
this block chain so you really have to

459
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:12,880
have a lot of fourth practice saying I'm

460
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,250
gonna get on this block thing and be

461
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,610
able to afford the currency that they're

462
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,210
using on the blockchain and some people

463
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,449
can't

464
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:24,400
people can't it just depends all right

465
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:30,490
but as we know it every vulnerability

466
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:31,280
the number one problem so we want the

467
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:35,000
trust people

468
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,510
want to trust when we see people saying

469
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,430
hey let's take this pork over here and

470
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,920
it's the same thing is that so just

471
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:45,020
depends

472
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,790
and like I said cyberattacks meaning I'm

473
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:49,550
gonna have a larger number of nodes in

474
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:52,389
the network those are rare because it's

475
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:54,800
expensive so I just read a story where

476
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:59,180
two guys were arrested in Albania

477
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:03,919
because they were stealing power from

478
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:05,390
the Train along the train tracks - they

479
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,370
were setting up their machines right

480
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:09,800
there by the train tracks healing power

481
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:11,300
to mine crypto that's all they were

482
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,760
doing was mining crypto for three weeks

483
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:17,510
and they got away with it until they got

484
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,610
caught and basically they were trying to

485
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:23,480
create a large number of nodes but to do

486
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:24,830
that they need a lot of power so it's

487
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,770
interesting what people are doing with

488
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:30,409
with blockchain and crypto it's it's

489
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:31,970
still very much Allah while with but you

490
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:37,300
saw how governments were using them

491
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:42,740
already including their own with Buckton

492
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:45,800
so you guys familiar with OAuth so I

493
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:50,450
gave him I chatted with those guys with

494
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:52,490
a few of the Olas developers and we kind

495
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:54,170
of came to a consensus of you know these

496
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,430
are the top 10 vulnerabilities that we

497
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,770
see from application security

498
00:24:55,430 --> 00:25:00,110
perspective some of potential

499
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:04,910
vulnerabilities I think the Ovilus was

500
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:07,370
last updated about two years ago and we

501
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:12,590
looked at it and said you know it's it's

502
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:14,419
number eight was probably one of the top

503
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:23,149
vulnerabilities when it came to

504
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:26,140
application because I can there's other

505
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:32,030
potential issues when we're developing

506
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:33,410
security contracts or anything else on a

507
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,350
blockchain but I think number eight was

508
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:39,380
probably the the one that stood out the

509
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:41,399
most so it's easy to miss configure

510
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,950
something

511
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:50,840
to deny people access to whatever on the

512
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:50,840
blockchain so if you're familiar with

513
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,820
apps on your phone the blockchain world

514
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:59,400
uses what's called D apps distributed

515
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:02,669
apps so just like you would go to

516
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:05,490
download apps on your phone like from

517
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:07,559
Apple it's what the Apple store and

518
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:10,470
what-have-you Android and Google Play

519
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:14,309
right that's where you go to get your

520
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:15,780
app the distributed app browsers where

521
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:18,090
do you go to get apps or over there on

522
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,879
the right any one of those you can go

523
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:25,500
get out so that you can on your phone

524
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:27,480
tap into a blockchain right so liske

525
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:31,110
right we covered that one if I want to

526
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:33,150
look at this block King there's their

527
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:35,820
app I can download it and just rip the

528
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:39,030
app on my phone plus any others out

529
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:42,149
there there's tons them these ones on

530
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:48,950
the left are quite interesting meaning

531
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:52,860
what's their purpose so he views so

532
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:55,590
golem if you downloaded if we all had

533
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:58,169
Gollum we went to one of those browsers

534
00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:00,449
and downloaded that distribute app on

535
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:04,050
the phone and if I wanted a mine

536
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:06,030
cryptocurrency from my phone I could say

537
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:08,520
hey I'll pay you golem because it's a

538
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,870
crypto and it's a bluffing right when

539
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,470
you have one you have the other and

540
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:17,729
using the same name I'll pay you five

541
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:20,220
columns for one hour of your phone's CPU

542
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,420
and I'm borrowing your CPU and your

543
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,790
phone since you're doing nothing they're

544
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,720
just listening me pop your phone's just

545
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,730
sitting there doing nothing

546
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,250
how about I use some of your horse power

547
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:31,980
to mine crypto and that's a golem it is

548
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:42,740
for example right it's a very easy way

549
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:45,440
to essentially control someone's augur

550
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:47,760
completely different type of

551
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,860
decentralized distributed application

552
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,440
augurs whole purpose and every one of

553
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:54,479
these has a different purpose is if you

554
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,280
can forecast the future

555
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,960
and based on how close you come to

556
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,950
forecasting the future I'll pay you all

557
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,990
go Widow right so you know it's more

558
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:06,240
than just kind of like betting in Vegas

559
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:08,640
right forecasting the future could mean

560
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,210
anything to any one of those governments

561
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,490
we talk about right so it could be

562
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:16,530
murder for hire right if you can predict

563
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,880
where this person's gonna be and if you

564
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,070
get to them first like a bounty hunter

565
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:26,100
I'll pay you in object cuz you predict

566
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:27,809
you first and difficult the track much

567
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,270
more difficult than tracking US dollars

568
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:32,820
it would happen right so auger is all

569
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:34,889
about forecasting and if we have

570
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,000
something like steam it steam it's kind

571
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:39,020
of interesting they're building their

572
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,669
own blockchain this is kind of more

573
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:46,320
innocent I'll say this is more about

574
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:47,940
articles what kind of articles you

575
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,520
produce the most that are getting the

576
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:53,580
most amount of light so to speak so you

577
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,679
produce an article and travel and if I

578
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,610
like it a lot I'll send you steaming

579
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,250
some steam

580
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:01,469
that's their currency right so we're all

581
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,780
long units that's the blockchain

582
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:06,809
I'll pay you steam if I like what you're

583
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:10,250
writing about so purpose here is just to

584
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:14,760
show you the many varying uses of

585
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:16,650
blockchain and crypto and how where you

586
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,720
go to download than the app the app

587
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:21,780
browsers the types of apps you can get

588
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:26,549
some are good some are bad some are for

589
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:28,470
both so Bakhtin and crypto does not have

590
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:31,200
to be this big naval this thing it could

591
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:33,690
be something as simple as just starting

592
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,270
there so this is the user side of

593
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:41,820
volcanic refills this is how they bring

594
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:43,290
people into their bluffing right so any

595
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:48,780
of you ever played with any of this trip

596
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:51,090
into that download world as if you

597
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:56,690
didn't have enough choices wrong like

598
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:56,689
Apple or Google Play to download more

599
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:05,659
tons questions so far yep

600
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:35,259
yeah yeah yeah yep pretty much yeah they

601
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:36,700
did have very little interest in taking

602
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:38,110
over the whole blockchain this person

603
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,789
would be coming on and get paid to do

604
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:42,008
something to forecast that predict

605
00:30:39,789 --> 00:30:43,210
something that someone's saying I want

606
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:46,419
you to solve this for me

607
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:48,429
any forecasted future so that's why

608
00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:50,679
somebody would download the app the

609
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:53,080
hacker wouldn't care what the app does

610
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:55,690
they just see vulnerability on the augur

611
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,570
blocking the hacker saying oh I see

612
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:01,480
these nine vulnerability like we talked

613
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:03,519
about earlier you know let me go create

614
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,399
a hard fork and destroy destroy the

615
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,200
network so they have a different purpose

616
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:13,449
on the block technique versus the user

617
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:14,889
who's using author to get paid so

618
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,720
there's the network side the blockchain

619
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:19,350
that can be hacked and then there's this

620
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,409
side over here the app that can be happy

621
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:26,918
it's no different than any of our other

622
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:30,369
types of computing methodologies where

623
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:33,850
you have a web page and servers I think

624
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:37,090
they both be hat they have different

625
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:39,719
uses I don't that answered your question

626
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,720
or not but

627
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:50,669
yes in the second part not well

628
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:52,860
traceability on blockchain is difficult

629
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:57,330
and that's the beauty of it from the

630
00:31:52,860 --> 00:32:01,260
hackers perspective tracing is we can

631
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:02,730
see when a transaction happens we might

632
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:08,700
be able to know who the two IP addresses

633
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:10,650
are but then after that disappearance on

634
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,990
the blockchain so I can get on the chain

635
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:16,170
when you get off the things pretty quick

636
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:17,400
yep traceability difficult I'm glad you

637
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:21,690
brought that up some of them I'm gonna

638
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:23,670
talk about that in a second so where

639
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,780
does the hacking community live how do

640
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,100
they get paid right so now I'm

641
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,600
transitioning from blockchain now -

642
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,980
Krypto alright Lee said most of this

643
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,110
presentation today would be more about

644
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:44,820
blockchain than crypto now this is the

645
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:46,350
crypto side any of you on these are

646
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,659
exchanges over here on the left just

647
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:52,800
like you would say the Dow Jones the

648
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:55,320
Nasdaq right S&P 500 well where do I go

649
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:58,020
trade crypto right this is where I'm

650
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:03,230
gonna go to quick trade crypto I create

651
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:05,160
an account and bam I'm in so there's no

652
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:08,400
let me go to USAA

653
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:11,850
and talk to their brokerage company no I

654
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:14,190
am I'm it I'm the broker on the buyer

655
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:17,070
and the seller I'm everything and so is

656
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:19,320
a hacker that they are all all the above

657
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:21,360
remember in the trustless environment I

658
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,120
don't have to have the middleman okay a

659
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,310
bank we're gonna conduct transactions

660
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:28,439
directly if I want to buy Bitcoin off of

661
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:31,379
you and you have to have someplace to do

662
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,840
it and this is where we would do it and

663
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:36,150
I don't know who you are when I buy you

664
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:41,610
don't know who I am when you sell this

665
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:43,670
is where we go right so finance is a

666
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:46,909
china

667
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:49,410
bitstamp coinbase or here in the US

668
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:53,280
crypto Pia is in New Zealand

669
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:57,020
Krakens in San Francisco and politics is

670
00:33:53,280 --> 00:34:00,330
I can't remember policies

671
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:04,770
in the past year crackdowns in the

672
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:08,360
happening on the on these exchanges for

673
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:14,340
example finance is no longer allowing

674
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:16,470
Americans to trade in Chinese own crypto

675
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:18,360
piya is having trouble staying afloat

676
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:20,009
New Zealand so they're trying to get

677
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:23,640
bailed out by the new New Zealand

678
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:25,230
government Paula Nix is no longer

679
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,790
allowing us to trade they're gonna

680
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,980
create a different trading platform on

681
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:30,899
the US base customers and the reason is

682
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:33,240
when crypto got really hot about a year

683
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:37,199
year and a half ago a lot of the US

684
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:39,000
people just flooded these the exchanges

685
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,580
and overpowered this they just didn't

686
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,330
have enough computing power to run like

687
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:46,949
an asset so they started shutting down

688
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:49,889
you people getting mad because they

689
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:52,040
couldn't get access to the crypto and so

690
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:54,239
these guys have had to do their own

691
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,610
self-regulation in terms of how they're

692
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,859
gonna allow you to buy or sell Christo

693
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:00,960
there is no regulatory body right

694
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:08,240
there's no Fed there's no Treasury

695
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:10,890
there's no bank it's all where some

696
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,669
questions on the exchanges I'm where to

697
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,670
go to buy and sell

698
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:27,789
yes yep so if I need to get before on

699
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:30,069
list blockchain and you and I want to

700
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:31,869
buy yourself something somehow we have

701
00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:37,058
to get an exchange involvement that they

702
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:39,700
both have by answer what everybody on

703
00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:41,440
the right side are the coins that you've

704
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:45,730
probably heard of now that's the actual

705
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,380
cryptocurrency and what do the hackers

706
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:48,640
like what do they want to be paid in

707
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,520
well it's whatever is the most valuable

708
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:58,210
right it's Bitcoin followed by

709
00:35:51,520 --> 00:36:00,490
experience and Manero has become a

710
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:04,660
favorite of the happy community because

711
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:06,578
the ability to trace it harder when the

712
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:11,379
six guys who created the blockchain of

713
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:15,910
narrow Jaime is so hard to trace that

714
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:18,309
the hacker said this is perfect for us I

715
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:21,868
want to be paid by now all right why

716
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:25,420
those six people did that who knows but

717
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:26,650
it's available and the Monaro is trading

718
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,569
probably one of the top 20

719
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:45,420
cryptocurrency and remember there's over

720
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:50,140
2,000 crypto currencies like Bitcoin um

721
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:52,980
questions on crypto you dare want to get

722
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:58,509
into that world with the currency

723
00:36:52,980 --> 00:37:02,529
trading yeah because the left side of

724
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:04,539
this is a buyer beware with it getting

725
00:37:02,529 --> 00:37:06,190
on exchange that's not regulated you

726
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:09,039
never know if you're able to be able to

727
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:11,980
get your money or not and then the right

728
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:15,069
side the coins themselves are valued

729
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:18,609
based on nothing other than what you and

730
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:20,558
I think there's they should be valued at

731
00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:22,299
which there's no inflation there's no

732
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:26,710
other variables that control kryptos

733
00:37:22,299 --> 00:37:28,809
it's just what we think the community of

734
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:30,840
people who are trying to trade Manero

735
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:36,240
for example right

736
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:37,680
whatever so it's um it's interesting but

737
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,939
there are still millions and millions

738
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:46,560
and millions of people think about

739
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:47,760
everyday crypto has stabilized right you

740
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:54,270
guys have heard of Facebook what are

741
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:56,450
they coming out with you heard where the

742
00:37:54,270 --> 00:38:01,050
government stands with that right now

743
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:03,149
those of you with clearances the

744
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,560
government doesn't like why well first

745
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:07,200
of all they hate these foods so they're

746
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,490
trying to be regulate them or regulate

747
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,750
then kind of give them defensive lines

748
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:12,060
well they definitely don't want

749
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:13,680
Facebook's Libre coming on board and

750
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:16,790
having their own currency that the

751
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,470
Treasury can't control right so I

752
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:21,150
definitely predict me will come out but

753
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:23,759
I think that's gonna be 18 to 20 months

754
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:25,260
before those and I don't think it's

755
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,180
gonna come out fast and safe to go as

756
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,500
you thought if you imagine what it does

757
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:32,690
what some doing on Facebook's

758
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:35,010
marketplace and you want obviously yeah

759
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:39,570
you think you'll be using Libre pretty

760
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:41,760
things yes I think everyone in this room

761
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:43,620
in about two and a half three years if

762
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,810
you train on HTTP you're on Facebook and

763
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:48,120
you by self marketplace I think you will

764
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:50,009
be and even if you're not someone's

765
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:54,740
gonna try to force you to so if you buy

766
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:57,000
a car on Facebook or even a a table

767
00:38:54,740 --> 00:39:15,000
they're gonna want you pay them in

768
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:17,490
legally which have big libras coming I'm

769
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,950
glad you're in here all of you to making

770
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:22,189
them so much smarter people who are

771
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:24,240
right behind those orders on

772
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:27,570
understanding you know where things are

773
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,759
moving so once labor takes effect you

774
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:33,960
know where it'll lie in relation to

775
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:36,300
atheria more bitcoins who knows right

776
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,490
but it's Facebook so they could easily

777
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:43,050
overpower Bitcoin I think in a heartbeat

778
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:44,580
if any issues and so my eyes are on on

779
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:49,500
Facebook and Libra

780
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:51,480
those are a lot all right so then what

781
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,290
do you protect do you protect the crypto

782
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,640
do you protect the string deed or do you

783
00:39:54,290 --> 00:40:00,240
protect the blockchain right it's like

784
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:03,210
you have these three entities what where

785
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,000
do I put my security well where does the

786
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:08,700
money all sitting right now in these

787
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,070
changes so that's what we're gonna how's

788
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:13,109
it going to try to go after so the by

789
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:16,920
Nance the paula makes the bit stamps

790
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:18,540
coinbase they're getting pinged every

791
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,380
day by hackers to try to find the

792
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:26,130
smallest vulnerability so they can just

793
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:29,430
find the smallest boy they have we can

794
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:39,270
get a lot of crypto and it's not really

795
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:41,700
true all right so yeah 20% percent

796
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,350
attacks are all happening majority of

797
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,089
them they're on the exchanges as opposed

798
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:47,730
to blockchain is even more difficult and

799
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:56,580
the Kryptos only in valuables if you can

800
00:40:47,730 --> 00:41:02,850
get it and afford it Miriam cost $200 so

801
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:06,060
every one of my two hundred dollars

802
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:09,770
would buy me one Ethan there's my eight

803
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,770
thousand dollars will buy me one Bitcoin

804
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:19,350
sound difficult so you know certainly I

805
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:21,029
think as companies look to use and

806
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,740
governments used to use blockchain the

807
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,900
better they can create traceability the

808
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:27,569
last bullet and the more hashing power

809
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:29,880
they have right the security the

810
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:33,840
stronger the blockchain will be so

811
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,250
traceability is a big one that companies

812
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,650
are trying to get their arms around as

813
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:39,330
our governments especially right because

814
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:41,310
right now the hackers and whatnot they

815
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,819
like the fact that blockchain is not as

816
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:46,650
feasible

817
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:48,210
but that world's changing soon right so

818
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,590
that's it I may be at time right now

819
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:57,570
give or take I'm not sure where I'm at
