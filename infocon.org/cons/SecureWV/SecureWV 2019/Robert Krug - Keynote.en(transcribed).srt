1
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,640
well good morning everyone has everyone

2
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,780
doing today yep a little more excited

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,310
now that Benny's got the jokes going

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,740
right everybody good

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:23,229
so well my name is Rob Krueger I'm a

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,509
senior security architect now I've been

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,040
watching all morning since since we're

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:30,070
showing up and I've realized that I am

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,538
older than many of you I've also been

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,129
doing this longer than some of you've

11
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,480
been alive so I was actually shedding a

12
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:36,640
small tear in the back of the room

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,089
earlier and hopefully that some of the

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,340
the jokes and innuendo that I share with

15
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,680
you this morning on hacking does not get

16
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,690
lost on the the age gap so we'll have a

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,479
little bit of fun with that I've been

18
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,349
doing this now for almost 30 years

19
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,960
professionally I've actually be getting

20
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,519
a paycheck for information security I

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,089
will not say the dreaded drinking game

22
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:59,559
word as little as possible I actually

23
00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:01,510
went to I actually started before was

24
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,159
called network security that's when it

25
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,870
was actually cyber that was a whole

26
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,760
movie you know the Cybertron I was like

27
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,490
transformers right so that was had

28
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,110
nothing to do with the networks or IT or

29
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,670
anything like that that was just the the

30
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,770
cartoon right that's all it was for

31
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,200
never even heard about it until you saw

32
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,610
the cartoon now in that thirty years

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,590
I've had a lot of fun I'll give you an

34
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,600
idea I've actually did a lot of what

35
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,130
many of you do so just really curious

36
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,130
curiosity real quick how many of you

37
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,839
actually do active threat hunting

38
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,539
creating vulnerabilities Metasploit fun

39
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,890
things like that few hands how many of

40
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:35,109
you are in charge of network threat

41
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:37,450
prevention stopping threats from getting

42
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:38,770
into network very very good how many of

43
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,649
you are learning how to get into this

44
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:43,990
business ah there we go that's the

45
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:45,880
audience perfect alright so I get to

46
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,500
help you a little bit with that I've

47
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,750
actually been getting a paycheck for

48
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,780
this for thirty years my first job I kid

49
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:55,689
you not I was a hacker for a private

50
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:59,649
investigation firm my job was to

51
00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:00,908
actually break into ISPs email and find

52
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:03,460
out when people were cheating on their

53
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:06,579
spouses that was my gentleman this is a

54
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,160
long long time ago this is prodigy AOL

55
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:11,650
CompuServe little thing called dial-up

56
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,850
right it was very easy back then you

57
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,280
just had to type in water for your

58
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,569
commands and you were in and you'd find

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,190
out what people were doing the hookups

60
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,720
and the PIA I would show up and take the

61
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:23,290
picture that was actually my first job

62
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,250
in IT and that was in 1990 I was getting

63
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,280
paid to do that night

64
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,020
90 so anyone's been around doing IT

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,080
security once said the dreaded drinking

66
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,610
game where anyone doing it that long on

67
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,800
a couple of hands right so we're the old

68
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,570
dogs in the room and we'll hopefully

69
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,280
have a little bit of information to

70
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,690
share with you so these days what I've

71
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,160
actually been doing is working as a

72
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,100
network security architect I actually

73
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,780
worked for a anti-malware vendor I'll

74
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,579
leave the names out of it this morning

75
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,310
nice little company been around since

76
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,110
1988 though I actually was previously a

77
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,020
director of solution architecture for a

78
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:58,450
firewall manufacturer so been doing a

79
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,370
network security network connectivity

80
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,709
network designed household names for a

81
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,209
very very long time part of that was the

82
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:05,860
United States Navy so thank you again to

83
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:07,720
all the vets in the room like myself I

84
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,730
heard someone actually say they were in

85
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,760
may be or was US Navy in the room I

86
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:15,488
think I was in cryptography in the 90s

87
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,470
so I was a cryptologist I was on offense

88
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:20,530
not on defense the moto for the motto

89
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,690
for my my team was in god we trust' and

90
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,920
all others we monitor that's actually

91
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,300
true story that's actually what we

92
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,519
actually did we looked at everybody

93
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,290
else's stuff and a lot of what I want to

94
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,459
share in this presentation is geared

95
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,040
towards two audiences

96
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:34,570
one the people looking to do threat

97
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,450
hunting looking to get into being a

98
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:40,000
hacker getting into doing vulnerability

99
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,880
or pen testing and those doesn't want to

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,769
secure a network there's a two little

101
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,480
size at the white hat and the black hat

102
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:48,040
right most of you in the room will

103
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,660
probably say your gray hats but there's

104
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,329
usually right and left right there's the

105
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,250
good but good guys in the bad guys and I

106
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,870
usually gauge my presentations towards

107
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,790
the good guys I want to stop the threats

108
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,500
contrary to what Josh said this morning

109
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,090
not to be argument with I actually

110
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,519
believe it is possible to secure a

111
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,040
network I actually believe it's possible

112
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,299
I've seen it done I've seen it then you

113
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,209
have to take the users out of it but

114
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:11,799
that's besides the point right if you

115
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:14,380
get a user on it forget about it it's

116
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,940
game over so when you look at doing this

117
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,529
when you look at doing some network

118
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,290
security when you look at doing network

119
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:23,140
architecture it is possible to achieve

120
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,910
security and that's where I start from I

121
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,950
work with organizations all over the

122
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,570
world to help secure their enterprise

123
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,500
whether it be state and local government

124
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:34,599
school districts federal government

125
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,740
international organizations I won't say

126
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:37,659
in their names because this is being

127
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,849
streamed on YouTube apparently so

128
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:41,619
security by obscurity is a thing right

129
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:43,628
so not saying who they are what they use

130
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:45,729
or their architecture is very important

131
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:46,719
I will say that some of the businesses

132
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:47,558
that I've worked with some of the

133
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,289
networks I've working on have been

134
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:52,270
completely devastated by bribe breaches

135
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:53,649
and then will come in and clean it up

136
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,779
fix it get them back up and running

137
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:58,149
secure the network secure the

138
00:04:55,779 --> 00:05:00,219
architecture and it's a huge huge effort

139
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:02,520
and that's what cyber security network

140
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:05,129
security is I got myself a drink now

141
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,229
network security becomes its diligence

142
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:10,569
its practice it's staying on top of your

143
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:12,360
game and that's something that all of us

144
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:15,189
can do by tending conferences like this

145
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,569
working with the the the doing things

146
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:19,930
like picking locks identifying

147
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:22,300
vulnerabilities captured a flag bug

148
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,789
hunting bug bounty programs these are

149
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,219
all very beneficial to network security

150
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:28,839
to network architecture so thank you for

151
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:30,909
joining us thank you for getting into

152
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:34,180
the industry because we will always be

153
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:35,889
outnumbered by the bad guys why they

154
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,019
usually get paid better this you know

155
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:39,519
throw that out there real quick but I

156
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:42,339
used to my father was in law enforcement

157
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:45,430
once used to wear a shirt you said crime

158
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:46,930
pays if you prevent it right so the

159
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,749
difference is the money that we make in

160
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,949
this is our careers unfold is the money

161
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,419
you have to look over your shoulder and

162
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:54,459
say how do I get that get that money

163
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:55,930
later right you don't have to be that

164
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:57,939
guy so with that so let's get into the

165
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,899
presentation I will try to end on time

166
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:01,479
cuz I know the only thing standing

167
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:03,369
between you and the food court is me so

168
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:04,688
I'll go ahead and get into that they

169
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:06,550
usually want to start whether is

170
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:07,990
explaining what network security is for

171
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,339
those in the room a lot of the

172
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,699
vulnerabilities that I'm going to show

173
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:15,369
you today are not fear mongering I took

174
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:17,800
personal offense when when Chris Krebs

175
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:21,159
here said that he wants people to stop

176
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,349
selling fear I'm not selling fear I

177
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:24,639
don't think cyber security professionals

178
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:26,800
network security professionals network

179
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,729
security vendors are selling fear I

180
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,959
think many of them sell awareness just

181
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:33,219
because Josh mentioned that a few

182
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,449
minutes ago you have to explain the

183
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:36,849
technology to people that don't

184
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:39,759
understand it many of you in the room

185
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:42,759
are experts you are the Jedi Masters of

186
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,709
network security of coding how many of

187
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:47,349
you have a copy of Kali in your pocket

188
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:50,139
right now there you go you're the

189
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:51,310
experts how do you walk around with a

190
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:54,400
Raspberry Pi in your

191
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:57,880
okay running a fake honeypot is it just

192
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,820
me sorry sorry it's fun at airports but

193
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,680
we'll get to that in this a minute I

194
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,969
were the experts we have to explain how

195
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,040
these vulnerabilities and how these

196
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,640
breaches affect everyday business

197
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:12,310
everyday networks everyday users and

198
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,960
that's the fun it's not fear it's fun

199
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,460
it's awareness and that's what we're

200
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,659
gonna actually do that so with that

201
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,349
first things first I'm gonna start

202
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,720
everybody off

203
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,160
get your security juices flowing I got a

204
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,600
couple breaches here now there's a lot

205
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,160
of spring chickens in the room so for

206
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,360
those that were not effective buddies

207
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,130
don't worry about it you'll get to play

208
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,600
along in a minute for those that were

209
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,070
affected by one of the breaches I'm

210
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,540
about to show you please raise your hand

211
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,370
just like to get a little tally on the

212
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,830
audience the first one for those in the

213
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,830
room that had a top secret clearance did

214
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,300
anyone get explores by the OPM breach

215
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,919
there we got a couple of that all of us

216
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,720
heading when the cops are closed had

217
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,340
other personal good easily con line not

218
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,050
just don't you know ped of great

219
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,239
information but the questions they ask

220
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,070
and for anyone who went through one of

221
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,560
those interrogations those questions got

222
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,719
a little personal this is you know

223
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,890
fukiko right just a little bit but

224
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,840
that's something you want to be you know

225
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:01,090
now how about on the dark web what about

226
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,130
the via who breach anyone get affected

227
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,869
at one of your spams account got

228
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,190
compromised right right no one who

229
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,800
actually uses that for email I don't

230
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,660
think in that case tonight here almost a

231
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,460
billion spam accounts got compromised

232
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,470
start off with spear fishes what about

233
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,419
the IRS breach that will affect anybody

234
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:18,430
in the room anyway you call up it up

235
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,410
maybe some of your parents did right I

236
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,840
know some of the younger folks right

237
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,640
what about Equifax anyone get caught up

238
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,020
in now and there we go all right what

239
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,740
about Ashley Madison they really caught

240
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,409
that one

241
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:36,260
it's good some people do raise their

242
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:37,850
hands but if you know one of the 37

243
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,039
million men and women women caught up in

244
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:43,520
this you had all of your personal

245
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,620
information released online you're oh my

246
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,840
gosh did lonely let me send them a

247
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,330
picture you made yourself the spear

248
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,220
fishing target of the millennia right

249
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,600
they know you're lonely they know what

250
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,890
you're looking for they say they don't

251
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,570
make no more than your spouse knows

252
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,880
about you and they send you a nice

253
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,490
little email and says hi open this you

254
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,780
click on it game all over and it

255
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,100
happened more and more what I actually

256
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,400
found out it was actually kind of

257
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,780
curious what besides the $15,000 and gov

258
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,620
email accounts that was caught up in

259
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:15,140
this but was the actual the the after

260
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,880
fact the class-action lawsuit where they

261
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,439
paid victims thirty five hundred dollars

262
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,610
all you have to do is it may have to

263
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,740
count they give you thirty five hundred

264
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,330
dollars for your trouble I don't think

265
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,610
anyone collected on that one just two

266
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,590
guys just out of here huh cities so when

267
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,270
you start looking at these these attacks

268
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,790
when you look at how they start working

269
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:33,350
it really becomes fun and that's what

270
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,839
this cyber secure network security

271
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,120
becomes the awareness the ability to

272
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,410
explain this to your friends to your

273
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,450
family to your colleagues to your

274
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:44,030
customers to your bosses to your fellow

275
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:46,700
employees explaining how these attacks

276
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:48,560
work and becoming the master of them is

277
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,190
worth cyber network security keep saying

278
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,839
sorry

279
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,270
never I'm with a lot of drinks tonight

280
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,850
which I'm ex-navy so if that won't be a

281
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:57,770
problem but when it's Friday so you know

282
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,840
it works out in this case some of these

283
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:01,130
attacks are really really evolved and

284
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,510
they're going to continue to keep on

285
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:05,210
coming all you have to do is read the

286
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:08,000
headlines getting a breach by just a

287
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:10,340
simple text message and simple SMS not

288
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,950
just compromises the phone botnets

289
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,060
taking over the globe the Myra botnets

290
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,280
still out there it's still available

291
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,160
right it's still just six just sleeping

292
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,910
people install plugins with that

293
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,459
understanding that if you install this

294
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:25,520
plug-in your PC goes faster people still

295
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:28,060
believe that I watch people doing typos

296
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,790
I put a plug in it's gonna keep me safe

297
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:33,290
you want to be very aware of what it is

298
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,000
explaining what these attacks are is

299
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:39,079
something that everyone in this room

300
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,400
should strive for we are the experts we

301
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,570
are the ones that are going to take

302
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,790
these messages

303
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,860
the rest of the globe like don't install

304
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,000
that third-party keyboard use the one

305
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,890
that came with a phone it works just

306
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,110
fine all right you don't need the extra

307
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:53,689
stuff and there's no such thing as a

308
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,190
secure operating system every operating

309
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,440
system can be compromised

310
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,360
it takes diligence to actually secure

311
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,050
them whether it be Windows where

312
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,340
there'll be Windows Linux whether it be

313
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,709
even Kali either Unix

314
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,840
Mac it doesn't matter all of them can be

315
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:12,620
compromised I see someone shaking their

316
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,200
head all of them can be compromised are

317
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,210
you able to type on it then you can

318
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,320
compromise it that's all thanks I'm

319
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,000
going to show you some operating systems

320
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,570
to have some fun with it shortly for

321
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,370
example fireless now where explain that

322
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:28,040
to somebody explain what Wireless

323
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,770
malware actually is can anyone actually

324
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,180
do that real quick can anyone explain it

325
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:35,240
just visiting a web page can be

326
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,410
compromised your system understanding

327
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,160
how these attacks them how have you been

328
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:41,240
to a little website called speedtest.net

329
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,819
just hit three hands come on

330
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:47,420
participation that's more fun when we

331
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:49,400
participate in 2013 speedtest.net was

332
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,260
compromised with a keylogger all you

333
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,910
have to do is visit the page from

334
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,450
January to March and you had a key

335
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:59,150
logger installed on your system just

336
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:00,890
visiting a page can deliver a fireless

337
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,420
malware attack and explaining that

338
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:04,910
understanding the network architecture

339
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:07,880
and how you prevent that how do you stop

340
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,770
something like that it's diligence hey

341
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,090
staying on top of the patches staying

342
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,189
aware of how the different

343
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:15,500
vulnerabilities work and preparing your

344
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,910
systems to prevent it now I like to do a

345
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,220
lot of demonstrations about hacking

346
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:21,140
works and I've got a lot of stories over

347
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,850
my 30 years but one of my favorite

348
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,949
topics is and network security or

349
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,170
hacking or pen testing a social

350
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:29,450
engineering it's my absolute favorite

351
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:30,949
you know why because I get to hack the

352
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,410
distance between the keyboard and the

353
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,990
chair and nothing is easier than how can

354
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,310
a human on the network it's the users

355
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,350
that are the number one security

356
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:42,199
vulnerability this is actually a true

357
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:44,210
story from South Florida Mike works at

358
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,980
Animal Control gets a phone call from

359
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:48,290
Joe hey Joe

360
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,580
unlike I'm an IT contractor response

361
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,530
we're fixing all the laptops in the

362
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,230
county I see a problem on yours I'm

363
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,529
gonna send you a LogMeIn request okay

364
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,269
might click

365
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:59,970
on it hacker takes apart the network for

366
00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:01,920
45 minutes the only reason to hack

367
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,449
stopped because Mike was Union close the

368
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,878
laptop to go to lunch true story and

369
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:08,519
that case half a million dollars in

370
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:11,850
damages half a million dollars in

371
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,540
damages in 45 minutes how could that

372
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,459
have been stopped

373
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,559
well maybe having more than one VLAN in

374
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:18,268
the network might have helped but doing

375
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,819
things like having awareness of who

376
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:23,910
could run logged me in application

377
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:25,529
control making sure that Mike knew to

378
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:28,230
counter hey Mike unless you get a phone

379
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:30,449
number from IT a callback from IT and

380
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,100
these these individuals with these pass

381
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:33,870
codes this multi-factor authentication

382
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,649
you hang up the phone

383
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:39,379
awareness training in user education

384
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:41,339
these are how you stop these

385
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:42,240
understanding how these attacks work are

386
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:45,089
a lot of fun too

387
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,059
in fact I'm not a Taylor Swift fan but I

388
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:49,290
was at Def Con that year I played Swift

389
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:53,610
actually the more ac/dc

390
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:54,870
you know or I'm too old for Taylor here

391
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,370
she said there's no need to hack a

392
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,559
network when you can hack the people

393
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:01,230
that running networks a harder people

394
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,689
are soft she was very right I've seen

395
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:05,790
more breaches from an end user than I

396
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:09,000
have from zero day vulnerabilities and

397
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,509
browsers or os's in hacking an operating

398
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,579
system

399
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:14,040
it's the users that get compromised the

400
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:15,809
most just to give you an idea some of

401
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,250
the some of the vulnerabilities that are

402
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:18,930
out there some of the end user traps

403
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,699
that have happened for example some of

404
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:22,319
the ones I've seen around there for

405
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:25,019
example and then walk into an office and

406
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,949
see one of these laying around and users

407
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,110
bother them in a little place called

408
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:31,199
Office Depot right the internet address

409
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,850
password log book and users love to post

410
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,920
things on social media like Dustin's

411
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,079
first credit card he's growing up so

412
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,179
fast

413
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,679
I'm so proud look at the very next post

414
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:43,800
thanks for dinner in my new corner and

415
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,809
everything I need they make end users do

416
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,420
strange things for example how many of

417
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:50,819
you have seen that in the office I walk

418
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:53,069
into Fortune 5000 business Fortune 100

419
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:55,949
businesses I'll flip over the keyboards

420
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:58,889
those years in password it's laying

421
00:14:55,949 --> 00:15:01,109
right there or the smart cards left out

422
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:03,470
I once worked with a federal government

423
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,579
agency I won't say which one let's just

424
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,129
explore space I don't all right

425
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:09,030
anyway this particular agency I still

426
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:12,510
used smart

427
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:15,480
arts and this is only last year it was

428
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:18,090
their only form of authentication just a

429
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,010
smart card that was all they had they've

430
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:22,110
been compromised for years and

431
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,930
replication easy to get around and they

432
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:26,220
were still using them and users love to

433
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,329
do fun things like to check their

434
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,640
Twitter password to make sure it's

435
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,530
secure and you're using a password of

436
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,390
check it happens all the time

437
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,100
my personal favorite one though this one

438
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,750
was actually a lot of fun as your credit

439
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,130
card number been stalled on the internet

440
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:42,230
and under the number and expiration date

441
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:44,040
the check-in users do fall for these

442
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,960
making them aware of these

443
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,760
vulnerabilities is easy this was

444
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,070
actually taken off the bottom of Angry

445
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,360
Birds the little free ad that comes on

446
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,760
the bottom of Angry Birds right when

447
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,060
you're playing there's a few years ago

448
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:58,380
didn't mean that I I pad got hacked it

449
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,439
mean Angry Birds gonna hack the ad

450
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,300
server got hats the third-party ad

451
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,080
server that was pulling the ads got

452
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,880
compromised

453
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,040
hacker injected that how many people do

454
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,540
you think fell for that enough that you

455
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,699
can go buy a stolen credit card online

456
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,930
for 10 bucks how do you buy a stolen

457
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,760
credit card online for 10 bucks you

458
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,729
stolen credit card oh it's a nice little

459
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,950
trick oh nice and fun entertaining for

460
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,570
anyone's watch talk on the break but in

461
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,250
these cases this is where the end users

462
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,690
are the number one vulnerability but

463
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,460
having that awareness having that

464
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,350
training doing like Josh said this

465
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,420
morning and explaining this technology

466
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:33,000
to them making them aware of it is how

467
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,140
you actually stop it now when you start

468
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,970
looking at some of these compromises

469
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,699
when you start looking at how easy they

470
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,680
are for social engineering this is

471
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,140
another level of example that you can

472
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,540
actually help educate the masses now I

473
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:48,360
don't personally watch hacker movies the

474
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,740
last hacker movie I saw sneakers I'm not

475
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,630
sure if anyone actually solved that one

476
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,760
I think there we go that's the best one

477
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:56,490
ever made I'm sorry dan Aykroyd his

478
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,830
mother is just awesome alright so anyway

479
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,940
in IO watch mr. robot actually could

480
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,220
swear on a stack of Bibles I've never

481
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,660
seen an episode of mr. robot why because

482
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,310
I'd be one of you in the audience to be

483
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,220
screaming at the screen you're doing it

484
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:10,230
wrong that command doesn't work that's

485
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,120
not a valid IP something like that so I

486
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,250
have no desire to watch mr. robot or any

487
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,469
other hacking movie I did have to go see

488
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:19,140
one though in 2015

489
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:21,440
blackhat my wife made me go cuz Thor's

490
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,440
in it

491
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,679
yeah it really is painful for anyone who

492
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,990
didn't see it don't bother I just saved

493
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:31,270
you 2 hours of your life you're welcome

494
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,860
alright so but Thor was in it and there

495
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:35,260
was one scene in the movie that was

496
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,949
really cool there was one scene that was

497
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:40,059
really cool

498
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:41,410

499
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,720

500
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,820

502
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,450
help me out and put it on another one

503
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,129
all right gives the security guard the

504
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,260
thumb drive the bank teller the thumb

505
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,490
drive so he plugs it into the computer

506
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,650
and Thor steals all the money in the

507
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,450
bank all right sorry spoiler alert but

508
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,940
again you're welcome just that was the

509
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,950
only scene worth seeing and I saved you

510
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,360
about 90 seconds just on that one so in

511
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,070
this particular case I decided to

512
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:10,570
replicate this in real life would that

513
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:13,090
actually work so it actually does so in

514
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:15,100
this case I replicated it but I can't

515
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,949
pull off for so I'm the girl in a pretty

516
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,480

nose and the ever-popular USB stick

519
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:29,309

Bay area banks doctors offices law firms

521
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:33,010
one building I walked into I didn't have

522
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,540
an appointment but the security guard

523
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,809
helped me she printed out the file for

524
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,340

525
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:39,790

gold star award she actually asked me in

537

a doctor's office is it a virus no no of

538
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:08,399
course not

539
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:11,470
okay here you go that's all I had to say

540
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,090
it's the best AV in the planet right I

541
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,290
just say no I'm not a virus and it just

542
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:16,540
works that's that's told my sandbox

543
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:20,080
effectiveness right there right I am NOT

544
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:21,970
a virus okay you're a lot in but think

545
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,610
about that how many of you are aware of

546
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,390
a little thing called HIPAA

547
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:28,770
how many of you realize what the

548
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:33,400
financial penalties are for HIPAA

549
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:35,260
$15,000 per your medical record not many

550
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,440
doctors practices can survive that maybe

551
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,320
the

552
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,240
hospitals and insurance companies can

553
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,399
but your small a small-town practitioner

554
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,370
cannot that's what they're gonna get

555
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:47,830
host having awareness of the Oh viruses

556
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:50,549
don't tell you they're they're bad guys

557
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,809
sneak in having challenge being

558
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:55,149
authorities are not allowed in the

559
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:57,850
building having that aware again

560
00:19:55,149 --> 00:20:01,418
security is achievable with diligence

561
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:04,840
and rules training policies procedures

562
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:08,169
and enforcement it is possible to get

563
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,658
there another one let's the logo fun

564
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:12,789
trick with thumb drives again the users

565
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:14,169
are your number one victim follow a

566
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:15,850
couple of model couple thumb drives on

567
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:17,740
the on Amazon there thirty you know

568
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:19,570
thirty thumb drives loaded them up with

569
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,820
some interesting files you know keep it

570
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:23,168
interesting checking access finance and

571
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:26,408
accounts wife pics

572
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:27,909
that's xx pics right and if you put them

573
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:29,230
into this wonderful files you get a nice

574
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:31,029
little public service announcement

575
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:33,580
you know you've been hacked just kidding

576
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:35,320
alright thanks for playing the game and

577
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,960
then drop those thumb drives all over

578
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,689
South Florida I haven't guessed yet I

579
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,850
live in Tampa Bay so all over Miami Boca

580
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:44,289
one got on a plane and flew to DC which

581
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,149
is kind of interesting put them at

582
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:49,269
Starbucks in the restroom parking lot

583
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:51,279
business center nice and fun right then

584
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:53,049
I pulled the analytics of these little

585
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,759
thumb drives who picked them up and

586
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:56,168
plugged them in case anyone is

587
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:58,210
interested it's very easy to do by the

588
00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:00,159
way nice little scripting capture their

589
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,259
OS their user name their IP their

590
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,480
location all a nice one fun stuff and

591
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:07,659
you get to see that after five whole

592
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,809
days you had 67 people pick up a thumb

593
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:12,940
drive and plug it into their computer I

594
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:14,740
dropped thirty sixty seven times I take

595
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,779
that back sixty four one guy clicked on

596
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,600
all four files can't fix stupid

597
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:21,639
um but in that case I guess he thought

598
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,408
it'd be different on the next time but

599
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:24,879
in this case yes sixty-four people

600
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:26,379
picked up the thumb drive plugged it

601
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:29,230
into their computer or their network and

602
00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:31,899
I was able to see their data how do you

603
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:34,450
stop that while you stop USB drives in

604
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:36,459
the building that's for one you disable

605
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,289
USB ports and make sure who's allowed to

606
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,409
connect devices who has authority to do

607
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:43,629
it how does that work for us in the

608
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:45,549
field of educating him making sure hey

609
00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:48,428
just because it has a USB port doesn't

610
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:48,970
mean you have to plug something in take

611
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:50,860
that cure

612
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,360
ah city away from it that's one of the

613
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,280
education that you can do one of the

614
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,080
lessons you can teach other people make

615
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,168
sure they're aware of it another one

616
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,309
social media my favorite fun times we've

617
00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:02,260
been seeing a whole lot of things in the

618
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:04,149
press about hacking the election in 2016

619
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:06,580
right I'm not gonna get political on

620
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,289
anyone but it makes it nice little fake

621
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,510
news website just to play along when

622
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:12,820
2016 to show that a fake news website oh

623
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,950
and a Twitter bot cannot be very

624
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,360
entertaining especially when you have a

625
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,520
fake news website with you I'm not gonna

626
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,928
be when after both sides here if you

627
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,460
click on anything or click on that click

628
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:23,289
date there you get the nice little

629
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,700
you've been hacked just a warning but

630
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:26,190
how do you make things go viral how do

631
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,720
hackers make things go viral

632
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:31,240
well again the Twitter bot that's the

633
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,159
only easiest ways to do it doing this

634
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:37,390
live on stage with a fake Twitter bot I

635
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:39,450
have 241 victims in 20 minutes more than

636
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:42,340
that in just the first 30 minutes and

637
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:44,860
then by the end of the day almost 5,000

638
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,360
victims there was a fake Twitter bot

639
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,729
just sitting out hey don't click on this

640
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,799
what do they do they click on it why

641
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:51,850
it's pretty and blue I must click on it

642
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,429
that's what the users have been

643
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:56,199
programmed to do oh if it's magical it's

644
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:59,230
blue it takes me somewhere special

645
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,610
so they click on it I sent one to the

646
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:05,740
Associated Press don't click on it they

647
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:07,600
click on it so one to two elections 2016

648
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:10,330
this is how hackers steal your data they

649
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,949
click on it it's really that simple

650
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:14,020
that's how the bad guys do it they're

651
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,030
not hiding there in plain sight and

652
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,908
users fall for it so you have to be

653
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:20,440
aware that users have to be trained take

654
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:22,480
the knowledge that you've gained from

655
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,220
these kinds of conferences the lessons

656
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,740
that you're going to participate in over

657
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,690
the next couple days I saw about the

658
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,549
lock picking the breakout sessions to

659
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:33,070
capture the flag the lessons you learned

660
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:35,740
in that take that back and educate users

661
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,960
educate your admins educate your network

662
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,280
administrators your business owners

663
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,830
these are the vulnerabilities that are

664
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,690
out there these are how they work it

665
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,820
helps to prepare against them it takes

666
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:48,190
diligence and hard work to stop them but

667
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:50,500
they are stoppable that's work it's fun

668
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:53,110
phishing attacks for example having

669
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,419
email security systems in place being

670
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,949
aware of what a phishing attack is and

671
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:58,720
it's not always just officiate so kiss

672
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,070
the emos forgive behind maybe one of the

673
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,500
African lottery just out of curiosity

674
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:04,149
great all right we're at the Nigeria

675
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,610
prints that's only money and you only

676
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,990
got one of those guys chasing you guys

677
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,399
know it was two Nigerians they actually

678
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,990
got arrested for that I would never call

679
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,970
about that one I thought two guys out of

680
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,500
South Beach but it was actually two

681
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:17,740
Nigerians a restaurant what about the

682
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:19,180
one that the Microsoft calling to help

683

you upgrade to Windows 10 anyone get

684
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:24,220
that one the IRS is calling because your

685
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:26,770
social security number is invalid I

686
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,170

687
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:31,570

691
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:38,290

00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,070
problem with my phone hang up the damn

693
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:43,990
phone

694
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:45,939
it's there it's not Apple being aware of

695
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:49,330
these things having this education that

696
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:53,200
no Apple does not call you Microsoft

697
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:54,939
does not call you sales maybe network

698
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,330
admin and you signed up for office 365

699
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:00,280
they never stopped calling you if you

700
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,750
had this awareness no make sure that

701
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,820
knows that somebody's not gonna call you

702
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,080
and say hey you're quitting your Social

703
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,030
Security numbers invalid or there's a

704
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,750
warrant out for your arrest hang up the

705
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:09,370
phone

706
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,770
because they don't call you to tell you

707
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:14,260
the police are on the way they just show

708
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:17,470
up they don't usually announce

709
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:19,030
themselves but understand these phishing

710
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,770
attacks not just what they say in the

711
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,060
email looking with that doing looking

712
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,790
how they're actually preparing these

713
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,409
attacks how the bad guys go about it I

714
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,670
won't spend too much on this particular

715
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,230
one because many of you in the room

716
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:31,060
probably practice this in your free time

717
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:33,040
but the way through and looking for a

718
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,929
company I'm doing research and finding

719
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,760
the company contact information finding

720
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:39,040
the email addresses all that stuff is

721
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,170
public that's how they get your email

722
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,610
addresses and then they craft that

723
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:44,260
wonderful little phishing email and they

724
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,909
send it in and the next thing you know

725
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,140
your end users are clicking on it

726
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,330
because they get an email from the

727
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,730
executive officer CEO and it's got a

728
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:53,800
little look a pretty blue link oh it's

729
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:55,690
from the boss and it's kind of pretty

730
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,040
blue link I must click it and that's

731
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:59,200
exactly what they do and that leads to

732
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,870
ransomware how many of you have actually

733
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,880
seen ransomware in action how many of

734
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:05,949
you actually made ransomware

735
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,320
all right there's a trick question all

736
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:10,180
right just saying going to say to those

737
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,428
spearfishing I'm you're a social

738
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,050
engineering but in that particular case

739
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:15,220
for those who haven't seen it just to

740
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,060
show you what it would look like you

741
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,850
know the little thing call

742
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:21,100
office 365 and users working along

743
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:22,959
looking in their nice little spreadsheet

744
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,969
they get that spear phishing email this

745
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,770
is the typical user and some of those

746
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:28,570
government offices or school districts

747
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,610
or otherwise they see that nice little

748
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:32,649
email from the boss and says hey install

749
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:34,600
this application oh it's from the boss

750
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:37,240
it's pretty it's blue I must click it

751
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,480
they click it they run it they do what

752
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:42,070
the boss says next thing you know

753
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,550
programs start acting funny on their PC

754
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:48,550
the fan turns on for some reason the

755
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:51,790
disk starts spinning up the mouse gets a

756
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:54,159
little lag in it what's going on what's

757
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:56,800
happening for the PC where are my files

758
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:59,320
as the end users going about this they

759
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,700
think everything's just busy before they

760
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,439
know it they go look at their files

761
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,180
watch how quickly the ransomware works

762
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,710
or those who haven't seen it before the

763
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,180
files are already getting encrypted

764
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:09,880
watch you through that them a whole

765
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:12,970
director here in a matter of seconds and

766
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,980
that is a server ransom or attack that's

767
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,870
how quickly it happens that's how our

768
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,700
end users just click on it but

769
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:21,129
explaining to those end users in the

770
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:24,160
office if you get an email from the CEO

771
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:26,200
telling you to click on it George the

772
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,200
CEO does not tell people to install

773
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:32,110
software that's our job that's the IT

774
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,030
folks job having that training having

775
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,850
that awareness in place understanding

776
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:38,139
where those vulnerabilities come from

777
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:40,030
educating the end users is very very

778
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,210
important that's where it gets to be a

779
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:46,360
lot of fun that's where IT security

780
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:49,470
becomes fun you are the translator you

781
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:52,300
are the rosetta stone you're the the

782
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:54,310
what's it the other one at the airport

783
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,710
that is reset itself they're translating

784
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:58,840
software you are the conversion you're

785
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,790
the translator says this is geek this is

786
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,580
English your the job that's actually

787
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:05,110
responsible to tell them this that's the

788
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,120
power that's the authority that's the

789
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:09,520
fun that's the wisdom that you bring

790
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,629
that's what makes you the Jedi these are

791
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,250
the droids you're looking for

792
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:15,130
you want to be able to explain that to

793
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:16,330
them and these attacks continue it's

794
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,170
really fun we still watching the match

795
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,760
in the mainstream

00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:10,120
you're lying in this case this

823
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,529
particular breach they send it to you

824
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,840
they send the exploit they send you the

825
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:15,220
email and you fall people fall for you

826
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,990
can go on right now and look at that

827
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,649
Bitcoin wallet and it's picking up a

828
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:23,169
celebrity earlier this year in January

829
00:29:19,649 --> 00:29:25,120
got this email they said someone stole

830
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:27,429
my pictures and decided to release him

831
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,529
on our own and say oh yeah we'll beat

832
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:35,260
the hacker to it then we'll have power

833
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:37,270
over me it was a fake these are the end

834
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,710
users that we must be prepared for okay

835
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:40,149
because they're going to be on our

836
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,740
networks they're going to be on our

837
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:43,959
systems these are the ones that you have

838
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,750
to protect the most because they'll see

839
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,669
this and they'll do things like that

840
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,929
how many of you have attended college

841
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:52,000
and got into some kind of psychology

842
00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:53,890
class a couple handsy

843
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,110
so you recognize this little particular

844
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:58,210
graphic yes now as those higher

845
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:00,158
alright so this is about first who are

846
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:03,220
familiar with it this is basically a

847
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,929
psycho psychological makeup of the human

848
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,360
mind of what it takes for a human that

849
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:08,799
becomes self-aware right how to take

850
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,459
care of themselves and the first level

851
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,320
is physiological this is the ability of

852
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,700
warmth shelter these are the the cool

853
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,490
needs of a human being

854
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:20,169
have you guys seen the update you've

855
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:23,250
seen the update perfect so everyone's

856
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:25,870
new at the new level that came out right

857
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:28,210
now for many of you who joined the

858
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:29,199
public Wi-Fi today how many of you did

859
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,720
just a curiosity

860
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,940
look at one person alright so what I've

861
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,529
read dangerous room right now so I was

862
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,870
listening to Benny this morning to talk

863
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:40,029
about joining the Wi-Fi with with Kali

864
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,469
or if you brought your work laptop and

865
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:43,539
you join the capture-the-flag network

866
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:46,090
you're doing it wrong yes

867
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:48,908
that actually does happen playing with

868
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:52,389
Wi-Fi and having Wi-Fi words Wi-Fi

869
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:53,830
security is absolutely required it's the

870
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:56,379
one of the easiest ways to compromise

871
00:30:53,830 --> 00:31:00,100
devices it's one of the easiest ways to

872
00:30:56,379 --> 00:31:03,039
discover zero days attack users and it's

873
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:05,649
really simple to do you all of you can

874
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,749
do it all of you can run fake hotspots

875
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:10,959
fake networks turn it up how have you

876
00:31:07,749 --> 00:31:13,479
seen the FBI surveillance van right SSID

877
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,659
right well you can name those SS IDs

878
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:19,239
whatever you want and no more no place

879
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:23,289
is more fun on earth than actually going

880
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:24,609
to Starbucks just saying actually how

881
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:26,049
many view been in Starbucks has seen all

882
00:31:24,609 --> 00:31:28,119
the people there all the people on their

883
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:30,700
laptops have you joined the Wi-Fi in a

884
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:33,580
Starbucks do your friends join Wi-Fi at

885
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:35,769
Starbucks nice little SSID called apt

886
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,029
Wi-Fi right everybody knows it

887
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:39,580
everybody's once that once-upon-a-time

888
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:41,019
connected to it but how many of the end

889
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,678
users on that network or do you think

890
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:43,479
are up to no good

891
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,609
have you walked around and seeing

892
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:47,499
everybody's device when everybody's

893
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:48,970
doing on all those shiny gadgets did you

894
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:52,809
see this guy sitting in the back of

895
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:55,450
Starbucks actually wearing a hacker

896
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:58,239
t-shirt sitting there in there

897
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:59,529
pretending to be a ATT Wi-Fi that was

898
00:31:58,239 --> 00:31:59,799
actually when I was running what was I

899
00:31:59,529 --> 00:32:02,289
doing

900
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:03,729
Oh SSL strip a few other commands fake

901
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:05,349
websites nice little thing called a

902
00:32:03,729 --> 00:32:07,359
pineapple I'm sure none of you have one

903
00:32:05,349 --> 00:32:09,009
in your back pocket or running on a

904
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:10,749
Raspberry Pi or running it on your phone

905
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:12,509
it's very simple to do how many of you

906
00:32:10,749 --> 00:32:14,889
have done this kind of testing before

907
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:16,450
perfect a few hands going off and this

908
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:18,279
one this is the most fun that I have

909
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:20,739
I've actually got one now it's a

910
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:22,659
Raspberry Pi with a Verizon air card on

911
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:24,489
it multiple hot spots I can make it look

912
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:26,590
like eight SSIDs as I'm walking around

913
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:28,239
an airport it's a lot of fun

914
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:29,379
you'd be surprised some people connect

915
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:31,330
to it just start surfing than that you

916
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:32,949
can see everything they do in this

917
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:35,978
particular case I was setting up fake

918
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:38,019
fake banking websites Wells Fargo Bank

919
00:32:35,979 --> 00:32:39,940
of America so that when they would

920
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:42,489
connect they'd get my DNS server they

921
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:45,039
would go to my website unencrypted I

922
00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:46,840
could see their credentials and just as

923
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,830
an education gentleman logged in trying

924
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,269
to pay his mortgage while he's at

925
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:51,340
Starbucks these are the end users you

926
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:51,849
have to be aware of he's trying to pay

927
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,099
his mortgage

928
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:56,860
I stayed up who's paying the mortgage it

929
00:32:54,099 --> 00:33:00,850
was for sure I am a hacker

930
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:02,169
stole your information it gets better I

931
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:04,000
thought it's gonna be a fistfight but it

932
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:05,230
worked I explored the mais deleting the

933
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,210
information you would never want to do

934
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,410
that I was being a public service

935
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:10,510
announcement it's funny you want to do

936
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:12,910
that go home do it on a secure system

937
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:15,910
secure Wi-Fi gave them my business card

938
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:17,380
but I could help them all that show them

939
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,420
I deleted the laptop right there an

940
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,530
image on a virtual machine all happy he

941
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,420
bought the coffee and took the picture

942
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:25,600
for me so it worked out pretty good in

943
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:28,299
that case that's exactly how we become

944
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,149
the experts the professionals we become

945
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:33,820
the evangelists for those that want to

946
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:36,309
get into that line of business it truly

947
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,678
is rewarding when you can start going

948
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:42,520
out and educating people how to not be a

949
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:44,950
victim how to be protected not just the

950
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,020
commercials you here on on talk radio or

951
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:49,440
on the infomercials a middle light

952
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:52,330
install this and it'll protect your busy

953
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,890
there's a VPN where you go don't join

954
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,870
public Wi-Fi use a VPN

955
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:58,690
oh yeah using a VPN but where are you

956
00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:00,340
going I've had people say oh we only use

957
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:03,400
tor to connect to the internet oh your

958
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:05,020
god understanding that that's not

959
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,299
exactly what you want to use to connect

960
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:09,070
to the internet that's when you want to

961
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:11,080
break the internet you want to connect

962
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:13,000
the different understanding is having

963
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,889
this information this is how we become

964
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,710
the experts to show them that when they

965
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:19,840
go to a hotel don't join the hotel Wi-Fi

966
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:22,300
network because it may not be the hotel

967
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,040
Wi-Fi it may be the guy next door and

968
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:27,280
he's watching everything you click on

969
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:29,409
and yes it was fun at the Marriott last

970
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,580
night even you see what everybody's

971
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:31,570
clicking on in all the rooms in

972
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,040
different directions

973
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,649
you'd be surprised if people click on

974
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,960
when I think go alone in our hotel rooms

975
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:39,489
or maybe you wouldn't be oh and this in

976
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,510
this case it's actually fine when you

977
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:43,359
start explaining how these

978
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:46,060
vulnerabilities work now I would do a

979
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,100
demo in this part of the presentation I

980
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,480
would normally have one of my gizmos set

981
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,609
up one of my attacks set up

982
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,080
unfortunately I said this may not be the

983
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:55,239
audience to do that because there's too

984
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,889
many of the the hackers in the room it

985
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:58,479
may backfire it may not work out or

986
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:59,980
people might get offended I don't think

987
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,530
anyone be offended if I hacked everybody

988
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:04,750
in the room would you know yes maybe

989
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:06,790
some of you some of you would say no you

990
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:08,890
can't hack me ok so we won't do a live

991
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:10,810
demo today I do have a recorded demo for

992
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:13,180
it's a lot of fun and I pick on

993
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:14,799
my neighbor's again being a technical

994
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,990
expert being a security expert

995
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,970
explaining how vulnerabilities work will

996
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:21,220
fun on your home neighborhood than it is

997
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:22,899
anywhere else so I live in Tampa Bay and

998
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,359
I have a neighbor who's a Tampa Bay cop

999
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:27,160
the detective won't tell you his name or

1000
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,920
anything but he's really in the drones

1001
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,149
anyone else in the drones anyone he's

1002
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,110
always doing he said he's always up in

1003
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:33,910
his front yard he's got the little

1004
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,590
headset on the little VR headset he's

1005
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:37,480
doing the Stevie Wonder impression right

1006
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:38,880
well then he's chasing the neighborhood

1007
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,020
cats taking pictures of the neighborhood

1008
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,400
flying it way up they were buzzing

1009
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,080
around doing all kinds of crazy stuff

1010
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,970
with it right and we're good neighbors

1011
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,560
we have fun with each other we mess with

1012
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:49,779
each other no fireworks at each other

1013
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,460
have cervesas as it goes shooting range

1014
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,410
fishing all that kind of stuff right so

1015
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,420
we have a good time and we mess with

1016
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:56,859
each other on occasion practical jokes

1017
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,810
things like that so he decides to text

1018
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,460
me one night says hey why do you silly

1019
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:02,350
dude why are you texting me at one

1020
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,300
o'clock in the morning I love my new

1021
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,740
drone he takes a picture of me through

1022
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:09,190
my office window in the back of my house

1023
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:12,339
with his drone he thought this would be

1024
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:15,850
funny he couldn't work out well for him

1025
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:17,460
I have to pay him back payback is coming

1026
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:21,819
so I think about it for a couple of days

1027
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:25,500
what kind of fun can a quasi ethical

1028
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:28,300
hacker have fun in a residential network

1029
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:31,840
so I decide to send him a text of my own

1030
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:33,430
hey bro drone pic Oh seriously I was

1031
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,470
just kidding you got to let that go okay

1032
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:38,379
cool I see you too

1033
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:38,859
Oh could you get a drone no bro I got

1034
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:42,130
your TV

1035
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:45,900
I'll bet compromising is Wi-Fi I took

1036
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:48,640
the picture of infamous on television

1037
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:51,940
for the security vulnerability experts

1038
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,549
in the room that is actually from a LG

1039
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:56,320
Smart TV running webOS and for that

1040
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:58,120
anyone who's ever looked at it it takes

1041
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,730
less than a minute to compromise just

1042
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,630
saying lots of exploits especially when

1043
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:03,550
you leave it in default

1044
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,260
you know her update it right so in this

1045
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:07,690
case this is blackmail evidence he's

1046
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:10,300
wearing his shoes in the house his wife

1047
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:11,800
has that plush white carpet he's not

1048
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,000
allowed to wear shoes in the house so

1049
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,740
he's got his feet up on the Ottoman

1050
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,270
there he was none too happy the next

1051
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:21,189
morning his payback was the years big

1052
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:23,140
adhesive parking tickets and Jesse knows

1053
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:24,740
they put him on that the drivers he put

1054
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:28,670
there on my windshield like take it for

1055
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:30,560
being an ass it didn't that actually

1056
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:33,380
backfired further because he had this LG

1057
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,970
Smart TV but something else he had in

1058
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:38,660
his Network that I decide if you also

1059
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:40,700
mess with him was since he likes LG so

1060
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:43,640
much he actually had their smart

1061
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,680
refrigerator as well and it was in

1062
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,290
default man

1063
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,310
guess what showed up on his icemaker I

1064
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:51,680
thought little logo they're gonna lock

1065
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:53,779
the in screen display there was not

1066
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,129
exactly what it was supposed to be let's

1067
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,960
just say it was a picture that gives you

1068
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:59,240
a reason to have the munchies in that

1069
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,860
case that was actually paying him back

1070
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,350
but this is the fun that you can have

1071
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,369
with these connected devices

1072
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:06,470
understanding these vulnerabilities

1073
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:08,270
where to go how to find them you're

1074
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:09,919
obviously playing with Metasploit Kali

1075
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:11,780
all the different patches all the

1076
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,130
different security tools out there they

1077
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,410
go back they go back a long way

1078
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:17,600
collecting them or using them training

1079
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:19,779
on them those can be a lot of fun but

1080
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,640
putting it to practice in the real world

1081
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:26,840
being that quasi ethical hacker being

1082
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:28,460
that bug hunter that threat hunter has a

1083
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,410
lot of fun to it it becomes very

1084
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:32,980
educational you've gives you the power

1085
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:36,710
the responsibility and the ability to

1086
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:38,540
train others how to not be a victim it's

1087
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:39,680
really fun to find some of these - some

1088
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,180
of these will actually pay you those

1089
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,589
rewards form and finding other kind of

1090
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,270
things and seeing how you can actually

1091
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:46,640
protect the different networks it's a

1092
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:48,500
lot of fun understanding how these

1093
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,089
networks communicate is also something

1094
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,460
while you're practicing all of your

1095
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:53,690
network security your dark arts make

1096
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:56,090
sure you're focusing on general

1097
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,680
networking general network IP

1098
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:59,330
communications is still the fundamental

1099
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,649
way everything communicates you got to

1100
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,970
understand how that works that don't

1101
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,920
leave that out of your education path

1102
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,569
make sure you're mastering that as well

1103
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,280
network security the connectivity of

1104
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:09,109
things it's really important for example

1105
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,170
just to explain how that works I'm going

1106
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:13,609
to you in the past 20 hours of pump gas

1107
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,710
I'm going to do a little little threat

1108
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:17,900
testing real quick perfect okay what

1109
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:20,030
about the hand of the doorknob in the or

1110
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:23,330
the stall lock in the restroom you wanna

1111
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:25,070
do that one past 24 hours yep okay what

1112
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:28,730
about handled the remote control in a

1113
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:30,380
hotel room yep imagine who else was

1114
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:32,900
handling that remote control room the

1115
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:34,570
day before you checked in and what they

1116
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,170
may have been doing with it right

1117
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:38,510
understanding how those different

1118
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:40,040
services now what about the gym

1119
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:42,530
you know because not everybody wipes it

1120
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,000
down unless someone's watching right now

1121
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,430
I want everyone to take your finger put

1122
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,720
in your mouth right now

1123
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:49,879
no I did it look at that you're learning

1124
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,649
okay so no one wants a class some germs

1125
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,450
along you want to make sure you're using

1126
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:54,650
you're cleaning your disinfecting you

1127
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:56,720
want to make sure these devices the

1128
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:59,690
connectivity how everything is connected

1129
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,689
how things touch how different exploits

1130
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:04,160
work how these different attack surfaces

1131
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:06,110
work so that they actually spread

1132
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,450
through different networks understanding

1133
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:10,280
how you can architect that solution to

1134
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,540
prevent these different attacks because

1135
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,580
everyone wants to make sure that hand

1136
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:16,670
going into the cookie jar they secure

1137
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,870
it's clean it's sterilized because you

1138
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,820
don't want that hand touching up against

1139
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:21,200
the other cookies you know what the the

1140
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,100
crumbs from one cookie going to another

1141
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,480
cookie you know what the cookies

1142
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,819
touching right all of that's where the

1143
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,950
germs and viruses all start to spread

1144
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:30,830
together understanding that connectivity

1145
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:32,779
is a lot of fun getting into security

1146
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:36,009
threat prevention getting into network

1147
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:38,750
security there is a whole literal

1148
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:40,490
guidebooks a whole archive of

1149
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:43,100
information that you can use to secure

1150
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:45,709
networks understanding security best

1151
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:47,240
practices understanding how to protect

1152
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:49,400
networks and protect users in different

1153
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,799
networks making sure that you're

1154
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,410
securing all that critical data

1155
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,630
there's NIST there's the center for

1156
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:58,160
internet security these are the things

1157
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:59,780
that you can do that the NIST framework

1158
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,460
is extremely popular to actually

1159
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,110
identify the vulnerabilities the

1160
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,960
weakness the precautions that you need

1161
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:08,060
to take in a network understanding this

1162
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,650
information will help you architect the

1163
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,930
solution that you need to actually

1164
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:14,420
prevent the breach again it is

1165
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:16,220
preventable just have to pick the users

1166
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,690
up if you make sure that you secure it

1167
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:20,060
if you make sure that you set it up in a

1168
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:21,740
way where east-west inspection takes

1169
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:24,590
place you're inspecting your encrypted

1170
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:27,080
traffic you do have a sandbox that works

1171
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:30,410
and it's inspecting more than executable

1172
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,790
files that it is blocking till verdict

1173
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:34,220
when you have these different solutions

1174
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:35,960
in place you have containerization you

1175
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:38,509
have the reporting you can actually

1176
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,220
secure a network now these guys get very

1177
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:42,080
complex to get very diligent they get

1178
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,759
very in the weeds so I'm gonna actually

1179
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,650
explain it from a little high level we

1180
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,960
want to get past all these red dots the

1181
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:49,160
first thing we need is the blue dots we

1182
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,010
need the firewall

1183
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,368
we need endpoint control these are just

1184
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,470
some of the

1185
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:57,529
things that you need to secure end-user

1186
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:59,930
secure networks email protection not

1187
00:41:57,529 --> 00:42:02,240
just internal email not just but for the

1188
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:04,308
webmail as well so many organizations

1189
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,439
I've seen compromised because some user

1190
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:07,880
went to their their yahoo their Outlook

1191
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,700
their hotmail their Gmail is something

1192
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,049
that not the corporate email one of the

1193
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,730
one of the breaches actually did the

1194
00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:15,200
forensics on was a fortune I won't say

1195
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:17,690
that extra name they're very very large

1196
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,490
international company billions and

1197
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,940
billions of dollars in revenue every

1198
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:22,160
year

1199
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:24,200
Billy multibillion-dollar company gets

1200
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,029
an email CFO gets an email from the CEO

1201
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:29,689
haywire transfer a hundred thousand

1202
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:31,759
dollars of Beijing okay did it next day

1203
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:33,440
I find out it was a breach find out it

1204
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:35,089
was a hack call me in the Deuter

1205
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,859
forensics I'm working with the IT admin

1206
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:38,720
and I look at the logs and looking at

1207
00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:43,190
doesn't make most sense I'm looking at

1208
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:45,200
it and the email went to the CFO and it

1209
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:48,289
was in his junk folder marked as

1210
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:51,618
phishing he unjust it in him fell for it

1211
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:53,059
anyway understanding that maybe he

1212
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:54,789
should have had unguent the thority

1213
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:56,660
would have been pretty helpful right

1214
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:58,489
architecting these solutions would have

1215
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:00,230
prevented a breach would have prevented

1216
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:03,019
those attacks multi-factor

1217
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:04,400
authentication if you're not using it

1218
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:07,220
then you're actually going to be

1219
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,630
compromised it's not it's not a if and

1220
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,939
or else it's something that's gonna

1221
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,619
actually happen for example I love the

1222
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,519
point this out how many of you tell

1223
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:16,039
people to use multi-factor

1224
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:17,238
authentication they're all of your hands

1225
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:19,099
should go up you should be singing this

1226
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:20,539
from the hills I'm saying multi fact

1227
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:22,299
they're not two-factor how many of you

1228
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:26,180
for example shop at Amazon

1229
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:27,680
come on participation alright so how

1230
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:30,589
many to use multi-factor when you log in

1231
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,239
Amazon less than half of you who shop at

1232
00:43:30,589 --> 00:43:35,239
Amazon raised your hands on the second

1233
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:36,710
question what that means is when you go

1234
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:39,619
to the checkout and you hit checkout and

1235
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:41,089
make my purchase you actually after in

1236
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:42,170
our code sends you a text message an

1237
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:44,089
email something like that to validate

1238
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:45,559
your identity because when was the last

1239
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:50,058
time amazon forgot your credit card

1240
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:51,440
number never right we want to make sure

1241
00:43:50,059 --> 00:43:52,549
you're actually telling people tell your

1242
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,349
friends tell your family use

1243
00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:57,410
multi-factor it's available on all the

1244
00:43:54,349 --> 00:43:59,420
things you do all your shopping your

1245
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:00,710
e-commerce your webmail your social

1246
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:03,230
media these are one of the things that

1247
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:05,359
you can actually advocate Evangelos

1248
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:06,410
Evangelos for and tell people to use to

1249
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:09,360
actually secure

1250
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:11,129
these breaches it's really important

1251
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,200
this is the skillset that all of us in

1252
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:15,630
this room have we're aware of this we

1253
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,009
know how these things work make sure

1254
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:18,720
you're securing the networks make sure

1255
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:20,880
the Wi-Fi is have just left open

1256
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,890
make sure it's veal and off maybe you

1257
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,450
wouldn't want your guests Wi-Fi for

1258
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:27,150
example to be on the same VLAN as your

1259
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:28,649
servers right just like a school in

1260
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:31,410
South Florida they learn that one the

1261
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:34,440
hard way making sure that you don't have

1262
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:36,839
your your point-of-sale machines like an

1263
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,090
airport and then maybe certain East

1264
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:41,580
Coast city did not have their POS

1265
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:43,620
terminals in the error air reservation

1266
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:45,900
systems on the same Wi-Fi network VLAN

1267
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:47,420
as their guest Wi-Fi for an airport an

1268
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,980
International Airport

1269
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:51,600
network architecture understanding how

1270
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,380
everything communicates understanding

1271
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,870
how the understanding how the

1272
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,580
vulnerabilities work is paramount for

1273
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:59,040
cybersecurity the network security being

1274
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:00,360
a security professional is something all

1275
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,160
of you have you have this knowledge

1276
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,650
you're learning you're seeking it out

1277
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,230
share it with others the more we can

1278
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:08,880
stop and educate against the apathy ease

1279
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:11,490
attacks in happening the more we can

1280
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,290
actually protect users protect data data

1281
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:15,660
archiving data encryption making sure

1282
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:18,360
people have backups what is the most

1283
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,529
important data in your home hey I want

1284
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,230
to show that one anyone know what real

1285
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:24,480
quick how many of you were married

1286
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:26,630
how many have families perfect what's

1287
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,650
the most important data in your home

1288
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:30,900
there you go some one say that family

1289
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:32,670
pictures the family pictures what

1290
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,960
happens if all your digital photos and

1291
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:37,250
instantly go bye-bye

1292
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,210
right how much pain does that bring

1293
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:41,190
right many of you have identity

1294
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,960
protection many of you have backup some

1295
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:45,030
credit monitoring service things like

1296
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,190
that okay you're protected maybe you may

1297
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:48,810
have data backup for your for your your

1298
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:50,940
my documents or something like that or

1299
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:53,970
your tax folder but how many of you have

1300
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:55,970
about a cold storage offline air gap

1301
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:57,450
Network backup for your family photos

1302
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:59,189
there we go

1303
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:01,859
beautiful you're doing it right but

1304
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:03,990
share that with others your friends your

1305
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:06,060
family your grandmother who just figured

1306
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:07,259
out what a digital camera is making sure

1307
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,480
that those photos are being put

1308
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:11,640
somewhere in a fire safety of the safe

1309
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,010
in the house or a safe deposit box once

1310
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,930
a couple times a year these are the

1311
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:20,200
lessons that you as a security

1312
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:22,029
professional need to share with others

1313
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,270
King goes on privilege management

1314
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:27,610
contrary to belief you do not need to be

1315
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:28,660
admin in order for Windows to work right

1316
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:30,550
you know in the login as administrator

1317
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:33,609
for Windows door I know it's it's

1318
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:35,620
heartbreaking you do not need to be root

1319
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:37,120
to make things work right just saying

1320
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:39,700
just want to make sure you understand

1321
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,200
the difference here maybe many of you

1322
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,779
are already paranoid I know I was

1323
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,799
talking to Binney earlier this morning

1324
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,330
absolute paranoia when it comes to

1325
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,670
logging and making sure that you log on

1326
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:50,410
as your user ID to do an install install

1327
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:52,300
the program log back in as your own user

1328
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:53,980
these are things that you can do but

1329
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:56,700
educate people tell people you don't

1330
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:59,590
have to oh you have a Windows PC at home

1331
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,060
you don't have to be the admin making

1332
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:03,640
sure they understand this setting it up

1333
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:04,900
correctly making sure they know that you

1334
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,370
all have to do these things making sure

1335
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:08,890
they're secure making sure they do

1336
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:11,259
things like monitoring or reporting how

1337
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:12,819
many of you work for a small medium

1338
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,320
business or Enterprise corporate

1339
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:16,870
networks are you in corporate network

1340
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:19,120
security there we go if you how many of

1341
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:21,130
you review the network logs my favorite

1342
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,720
question of all time hey we got to buy

1343
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:25,990
more internet because the internet slow

1344
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,339
why what happened what changed or if

1345
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:29,529
it's or it's not enough

1346
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:31,330
why who's doing what if you can't answer

1347
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:34,200
that question you're not reviewing it is

1348
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:38,950
it a botnet or is it just you two

1349
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:40,240
is it Netflix or is it tor are you

1350
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:41,890
understanding the difference of what

1351
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,109
applications having the logging and

1352
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:46,330
reporting is is if fundamental need for

1353
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:47,890
network security if you're not reviewing

1354
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,970
the logging it's gonna be something that

1355
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,220
you're not gonna be able to tell what

1356
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:52,810
happened you can't do forensics without

1357
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,939
the logging how many of you do network

1358
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:56,830
security forensics how important are the

1359
00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:00,910
logging how important is syslog to that

1360
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:03,549
operation if they it's the lifeblood you

1361
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:05,500
can't even start without it and then

1362
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,210
management and training again this is

1363
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,310
something you're partaking in this now

1364
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:10,990
it's something that you are doing right

1365
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:14,529
now to better yourselves to get down

1366
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:15,910
this road share it with others make sure

1367
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:17,320
that they're aware understand how these

1368
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:19,870
different things happen how they can

1369
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:22,300
protect themselves and will actually be

1370
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:25,150
able to prevent breaches there was an

1371
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:27,040
article just an hour ago just this

1372
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:28,660
morning where hospitals have done a

1373
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,029
study and found that people are dying

1374
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:33,640
from heart attack related incidents due

1375
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:34,119
to ransomware attacks at hospitals that

1376
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,269
was

1377
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:39,130
this morning share that

1378
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:41,499
why is read somewhere a problem at

1379
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:43,869
hospitals because users like pretty blue

1380
00:48:41,499 --> 00:48:45,999
things they click on it understand how

1381
00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:47,950
that can be stopped understand how that

1382
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:49,749
can be patched understand how that can

1383
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:51,069
be prevented and you'll be able to

1384
00:48:49,749 --> 00:48:53,558
prevent a breach and maybe save a life

1385
00:48:51,069 --> 00:48:55,150
so with that in closing just so

1386
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:57,069
everybody remembers to leverage a true

1387
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:59,109
security solution I want to make sure

1388
00:48:57,069 --> 00:49:01,240
you do you want to keep viruses out of

1389
00:48:59,109 --> 00:49:04,119
the network all right you got to keep

1390
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:06,069
them off the computer you want to

1391
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:09,309
install a real security right you want

1392
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:10,269
to make it hard to get in you want to

1393
00:49:09,309 --> 00:49:13,019
make sure you're installing your

1394
00:49:10,269 --> 00:49:15,609
security solution in the right place

1395
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:16,930
never install a security solution for

1396
00:49:15,609 --> 00:49:20,109
your security solution it doesn't work

1397
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:21,848
out well all right make sure you're

1398
00:49:20,109 --> 00:49:23,740
doing the training make sure you educate

1399
00:49:21,849 --> 00:49:26,789
the user so that when it says keep the

1400
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:28,808
day lock they don't leave it wide open

1401
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:30,730
make sure you they're using complex

1402
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:33,430
passwords multi-factor authentication we

1403
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:36,549
don't want to make it too easy just so

1404
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:38,499
you know this is actually off a very

1405
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:41,739
critical infrastructure I'm gonna say

1406
00:49:38,499 --> 00:49:43,779
what and the Florida Keys this is on the

1407
00:49:41,739 --> 00:49:45,730
the actual access panel to access the

1408
00:49:43,779 --> 00:49:48,430
facility for a critic what would be

1409
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:50,279
defined by DHS by Homeland Security as

1410
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:52,989
critical infrastructure just saying

1411
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:56,289
these are the things that we as network

1412
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:59,079
security eyes and threat prevention

1413
00:49:56,289 --> 00:50:02,049
threat hunters security professionals

1414
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:03,640
can educate the masses on with the right

1415
00:50:02,049 --> 00:50:05,319
security with the right education with

1416
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,879
the right training thing in place you

1417
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:09,269
can actually develop a security solution

1418
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,349
like this nothing got through it right

1419
00:50:09,269 --> 00:50:12,189
how'd that break any one inch I'm sure

1420
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:14,980
that all of you saw the movie

1421
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:17,349
how many harder to break and then user

1422
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:19,450
insider threat and for that we have

1423
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:20,559
Chuck Norris thank you very much for

1424
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,569
your time I hope you enjoyed the

1425
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:26,170
presentation any questions comments

1426
00:50:22,569 --> 00:50:32,849
concerns snide remarks there you go yes

1427
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:32,849
sir yes

1428
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:53,310
there's always that trade-off so if the

1429
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:54,779
different levels depends question was

1430
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:57,090
how do I explain I'm when I'm out here

1431
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,200
doing this evangelist I love to do this

1432
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:00,210
is my passion

1433
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:03,060
when I'm not there doing how do I tell

1434
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:04,950
users to get over the cost as Josh

1435
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:07,140
plants more cyber network security can

1436
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:08,370
be quite expensive there's also at the

1437
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:09,960
disturbance point this question is how

1438
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:12,120
do you explain the inconvenience for

1439
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,580
users oh my god I gotta type in a

1440
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:17,359
password to look at a message the login

1441
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:19,980
I can't just click on it and be there no

1442
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:21,930
understanding what the risk is so for it

1443
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:24,060
depends on the audience if I'm speaking

1444
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:26,940
to residential users it's the family

1445
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:29,460
photos that's the critical you start out

1446
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:32,400
that what's what matters most to the

1447
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:35,910
business owners it's what's at risk yes

1448
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:38,490
Equifax they suffer a massive breach pay

1449
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:41,040
a fine and their stock went down for a

1450
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:42,899
day they've stopped took a dip their

1451
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,300
stock is valued more now than it was

1452
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:47,210
before the breach that same thing with

1453
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:50,250
Marriott same thing with British Airways

1454
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:52,230
same thing with Air Canada they can

1455
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:54,810
survive the breach they pay the fine and

1456
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:57,420
keep on trucking if they have a flying

1457
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:58,890
in their case you look at others you

1458
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:04,140
look at the smaller medium business

1459
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:07,620
maybe the the local boutique that sells

1460
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:10,440
widgets they have customer data they get

1461
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:13,350
compromised they have to pay a fine the

1462
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,180
PCI they have to pay a fine to Visa and

1463
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:17,160
MasterCard for not doing best practice

1464
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:18,690
security or the doctor has to as a HIPAA

1465
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:21,029
fine because someone in his office

1466
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:22,760
clicked on ransomware yes if a doctor's

1467
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:25,350
office gets ransomware that's a breach

1468
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:28,250
Health and Human Services will find them

1469
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:32,850
eventually after the lawyers get done

1470
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:35,190
that's an expense it is more easy to do

1471
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:36,960
security the right way have the training

1472
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:39,390
make sure people aren't logging in as

1473
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,460
administrator having an AV software

1474
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:44,339
using multi-factor authentication is

1475
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:46,320
easier to do that then to pay for the

1476
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:47,460
breach than to clean it up after because

1477
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,809
the dock that's small

1478
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:52,500
the medium business they won't survive

1479
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:56,339
that seven-figure fine how many of you

1480
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:59,220
know about GDP are a couple hands it is

1481
00:52:56,339 --> 00:53:01,799
insanely powerful regardless if it's

1482
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:03,720
applicable it's insanely powerful and it

1483
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,970
affects businesses here in the states if

1484
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:08,220
you do business you have a customer or

1485
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:13,049

are can be subject to its applications

1488
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:21,839
to its fines and they're not small you

1489
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:24,180
can't be tied up in years of litigation

1490
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:27,690
and stuff to pay the lawyers in that

1491
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:29,250
case it's always easier to set it up

1492
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:30,950
correctly in the first place than it is

1493
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:33,450
to clean up the breach after the fact

1494
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:35,700
yes is it an inconvenience yes it's my

1495

wife hate typing in my passwords yes

1496

long we been married 20 years

1504
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:55,529
understanding how that works

1505
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:57,119
understanding the risk factors of all

1506
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:59,720
when was the last time my grandmother

1507

1508
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:03,029
understanding that understanding of the

1509
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:05,460
risk understanding the precautions is

1510
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:06,990
important and yes there is always a

1511
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:08,609
trade-off there always will be there

1512
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:10,618
will always be the users especially in

1513

1517
00:54:18,869 --> 00:54:23,160
protect it what is it worse

1518
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:25,109
understanding that it's always gonna be

1519
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,578
a trade-off but yes it is explainable
