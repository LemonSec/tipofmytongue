1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:23,090
sit okay all right okay well finally we

2
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:26,779
got everything works out and so we will

3
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:29,630
start the program first of all is my

4
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:32,000
name is ek shall we I'm data science my

5
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,760
training can have been programming in

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,769
Python primarily and are for about for a

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:43,519
long time when they first was approaches

8
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:45,559
to give this talk I thought how could

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,510
you give a talk about Python in an hour

10
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:50,839
or an hour and a half it's nearly

11
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:54,349
impossible to do and given the enormity

12
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:56,300
of Python nobody else actually could do

13
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,809
that even if you try and especially in

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,799
two hours

15
00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:04,908
you can't even introduce one of the

16
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:08,990
modules in in two hours and so what

17
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:10,430
would you do and I thought also I don't

18
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,310
know what the background of the

19
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:16,010
participant that much and I figured if

20
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,750
you are very good at Python probably you

21
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,670
wouldn't be here you don't need to be

22
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,470
here because you know that you're not

23
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,800
going to learn as much in an hour or two

24
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:27,950
or two hours so the way this talk was

25
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,950
structure is I'm going to talk about the

26
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:33,320
connection between data science and

27
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:36,020
python and given the fact that data

28
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,449
science and cybersecurity and security

29
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:41,330
in general are probably two of the

30
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:44,690
hardest you know job the hardest

31
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:46,429
basically in the marketer if you're a

32
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,789
data science sort of your cybersecurity

33
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:52,760
you have plenty of jobs so what I did

34
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:55,220
one thing is I watched the two speakers

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,620
that they give this similar talk before

36
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,090
and what they did is basically they have

37
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,490
their specialty and they talk about

38
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,530
their specialty and they could they

39
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,919
wrote a lots of script in the computer

40
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,989
and I thought I don't know if that would

41
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,590
be really very productive instead what I

42
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:15,590
decided to do is I decided to give about

43
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,510
40 minutes maybe you know plus or minus

44
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,599
five minutes presentation general about

45
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,939
very basic Python about data science and

46
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:26,119
about the intersection between the two

47
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:28,700
and in the next part I basic

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,890
let's just put together a very very

49
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:35,510
simple code that is if you are a new to

50
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:38,029
Python or if maybe you just want to

51
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,890
start by then then did these kind of

52
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:43,220
exercises just show a few things and

53
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:45,078
basically what I do is I have I have em

54
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,120
in a text file I'm just gonna when I do

55
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:49,250
that I cut them based him in the screen

56
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,260
and ask you to random or ask him at

57
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,049
least think of what what the code will

58
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:58,819
do does make sense to everybody here

59
00:02:53,049 --> 00:03:01,849
okay like I said by 10 is a huge most of

60
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:03,410
you just probably and probably the most

61
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:06,410
I don't know some other people may

62
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:10,099
disagree but by then is at least it's

63
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,390
always come in the first 3 CC of when it

64
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:13,760
comes to data science and a lots of

65
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,730
other things there are others but I'm

66
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:21,349
going to present today their side or of

67
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:24,798
Python so any objective of this talker

68
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:27,140
very simple is basically to provide the

69
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,579
general information about data size that

70
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,559
would be very brief or provide

71
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:33,200
introduction to Python language and

72
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,620
again you cannot do just the student or

73
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,880
even to buy an introduction to Python

74
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:43,040
within half an hour so and then it be

75
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,230
present the case why python is the de

76
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,480
facto maybe there is another one

77
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:53,328
anybody here knows or heard of something

78
00:03:47,480 --> 00:04:01,849
called are few people heard of are are

79
00:03:53,329 --> 00:04:03,799
just well it's so funny so there are a

80
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:06,440
lots of people who really haven't heard

81
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,510
about and you can understand because r

82
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,340
is developed by a bunch of people I

83
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,160
think in New Zealand for statistics

84
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,290
beginning in the 70s and now basically

85
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,940
it basically whenever you see are

86
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:21,409
especially data science or price and you

87
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:23,690
see are and in fact this doc I had the

88
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,880
option whether to talk about Python or R

89
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,860
and I thought I'll talk this time maybe

90
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,380
about my son and who is minister and

91
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,000
then to provide like main things about

92
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:35,690
mice and all the last thing that I told

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,820
you I will excuse me I will I'll provide

94
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,870
basically some code some simple code for

95
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:43,500
people special Newton language yeah

96
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:47,820
see what we'll do all right first of all

97
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,710
is data science is fitting you it's kind

98
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,080
of in you and maybe nothing you what's a

99
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,090
new is because now it's established as a

100
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,760
data science but the truth is data

101
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:59,520
science has been with us for over a

102
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,039
century and I'm just going to very very

103
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,280
a short story I don't know how many of

104
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,080
you remember your high school chemistry

105
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,000
and if you don't remember right I remind

106
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,560
you if you look at the periodic table

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,990
everybody remember what the periodic

108
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,610
table right and the periodic table

109
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,470
basically is nothing more a table for

110
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,080
the elements organized by their atomic

111
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:21,870
number which is a basically a number in

112
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,630
the natural number so you just went to

113
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,820
three the question is long time ago why

114
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,080
would then a few and if the number of C

115
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,370
question why do you have to put them in

116
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,550
a table what they have to go back and

117
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,200
forth back and forth and what the dad

118
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,050
did is that this is a rush I mean a

119
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,950
Russian chemist and what he did is he

120
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:43,290
noticed if if he goes like sequentially

121
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,450
he knows the physical chemical property

122
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,160
repeated themselves and so that's why

123
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:50,130
you have a table instead of column or

124
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,350
row and that's really basically finding

125
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,330
patterns in data that's really all

126
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,700
what's into it in it right that's really

127
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,950
a data science so just to give you an

128
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,510
example because their size is new so

129
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,640
when you hear data science data

130
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,710
analytics or analytics they're also on

131
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,800
the same and in fact they are equivalent

132
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:11,430
they are the same so definition of data

133
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,230
science consists of tours data unsigned

134
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,030
so let's define the data and define the

135
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:18,150
size and combine together we'll get the

136
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:20,609
definition of data science so basically

137
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,049
it I'm just reading you can read it as

138
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,540
always basic collection of pieces of

139
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,430
information such as numbers blah blah

140
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,820
and you have they you have basically the

141
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,110
example that everybody seen this is and

142
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,360
then the science is also this is a

143
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,700
standard definition basically is a

144
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,640
systematic organized body of knowledge

145
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:41,820
of a particular subject in this case to

146
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,370
deal with data and with a general

147
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:47,310
theoretical framework don't worry about

148
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,990
that but most sizes have a general you

149
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,620
know theoretical framework you cannot

150
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,260
disturb the sign without a theoretical

151
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:58,320
framework

152
00:06:53,260 --> 00:07:01,060
and now with the white data is important

153
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,170
well this is not my quarter of the mixen

154
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,540
but this is somebody else as much

155
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:08,710
smarter than me I suppose this is what

156
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:12,490
they say why it's important data is then

157
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:14,799
your oil really I don't know but at

158
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,870
least we know one thing is how much we

159
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,850
depend in oil you know these people

160
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:22,240
think we will eventually dependent data

161
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:24,520
as much that's why it's very important

162
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,310
and I'm pretty sure everybody in this

163
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:30,159
room knows data is important if you try

164
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,750
to buy anything online and car or a

165
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,580
phone or something and just sudden

166
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:36,370
whenever you go to website that phone or

167
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:41,080
that car shows up that's a very good

168
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:44,350
example of the use of data size what is

169
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:47,440
data data science is it it's a process

170
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:50,290
basically data science is the process of

171
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,410
cleaning implementing transferring and

172
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:54,850
modeling raw data with the goal of

173
00:07:52,410 --> 00:08:01,210
discovering you know information from

174
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:03,130
the data so every business and I'll

175
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,080
agree that every business uses data

176
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:07,360
science every business needs data

177
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,419
science because now this is very very

178
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,080
important what are the example of this

179
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:15,820
is sometimes the picture or not may not

180
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,770
be clear because it's hard to put them

181
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,870
all together but a picture they say what

182
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,609
are the thousand words and in this case

183
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,520
maybe it's worth a hundred or so if you

184
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:28,260
can read it so this is basically the

185
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,260
general definition of data science

186
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:35,919
foundation and tools of analytics or

187
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:44,010
data science what would you need to do

188
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:47,199
to be a data scientist well those are

189
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:50,350
basically definite statistics

190
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,810
mathematics and computer science now

191
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:56,920
some we say who on earth would know all

192
00:08:52,810 --> 00:09:00,699
these three and the answer is none what

193
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:03,550
the best people who published books and

194
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:06,850
experts in the field what they normally

195
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:09,459
are they have a dual degree in

196
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:13,720
to subject by definition and then they

197
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:16,089
learn in the third that's basically the

198
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,899
the most prolific data signs are that

199
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:21,730
way what are the major area in analytics

200
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:27,160
are data science I'm pretty sure

201
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:29,079
everybody here it with these data mining

202
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,589
if you are from West Virginia from this

203
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:34,420
area at least you know what mining is

204
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:36,370
mining if you or a mined for coal you'll

205
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,860
go you're lucky sometimes you find a

206
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:41,350
very nice clean piece of coal but that's

207
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,329
enough often doesn't happen you need to

208
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,800
look for that dig for it to process it

209
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:46,180
know everything to get what you need out

210
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,639
it's the same thing

211
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:52,269
machine learning is another very huge

212
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:54,790
topics it's too big it's almost like

213
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:56,589
hard to define but if I were to define

214
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,529
this new two or three words it would be

215
00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:02,019
about prediction you know how can you

216
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:04,329
predict things whether you predict them

217
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:06,790
statistically or a graphically or one

218
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:09,160
way or another that's basically for the

219
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:13,349
most part visualization is really a

220
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:16,029
fancy theorem just for graphing and

221
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,920
modeling and simulation that's a huge

222
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:19,990
topic and the science you can model all

223
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,099
the free have computer modeling you have

224
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,449
mathematical modeling you have

225
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,620
statistical modeling you have all

226
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:31,859
different kinds of modeling what are the

227
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:37,290
major software tools for analytics and

228
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:40,029
here are you see our Python Excel act

229
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:43,599
let me say a word or two and I would say

230
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:45,100
a lot more about this is with Excel some

231
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,009
people they think I have was an

232
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,480
immediate in Pittsburgh several weeks

233
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:51,790
ago and I was talking to a computer

234
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,470
scientist and I said there are some

235
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,029
people they think they can do analytics

236
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,829
with Excel and he was really upset

237
00:10:55,029 --> 00:11:00,399
because a lots of people don't like

238
00:10:56,829 --> 00:11:02,079
Excel and it's not they don't like it

239
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,519
because it's Excel it it they don't some

240
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,839
some people don't like it because you

241
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,839
really cannot do much with Excel

242
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:11,949
specially if you have big data the truth

243
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:14,740
though is Excel like at it as necessary

244
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:17,229
but not sufficient some time is as

245
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,389
longer because if you see the data you

246
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,740
can figure it out you can know what what

247
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:22,810
kind of code you can write for

248
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,120
to be a processor but if you don't see

249
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:27,910
it it's it's it's a little difficult

250
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,380
I am Python and important to get that

251
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:32,560
and we'll talk a little bit more about

252
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:35,320
them and then you don't have a different

253
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,810
tools you have basically Hey Dude

254
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,350
tensorflow rabbit miner and all these

255
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,079
guys

256
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:44,950
most of these either open source or they

257
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:46,750
have a version for open source which one

258
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,230
do you need dependence in the task at

259
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,110
hand

260
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:52,660
and so whatever you have you figured out

261
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,820
about between these the basic and the

262
00:11:52,660 --> 00:12:00,370
advantage advanced it you should be able

263
00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:03,250
basically to get everything you need who

264
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,860
can be a data scientist if you look at

265
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,210
the previously we defined what data what

266
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,580
science will the tool isn't there for

267
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:12,100
you would you know the definition but

268
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:14,680
here is this is the classic you know

269
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,440
definition years ago and it says

270
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,150
basically a data science is somebody who

271
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,100
knows more statistics there are computer

272
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:24,870
programmers it knows more programming

273
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:28,240
than statistician whatever that means

274
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:30,670
but really that's insufficient that's

275
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,820
not really a good definition is it's

276
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:37,449
incomplete definition nowadays I think

277
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:39,040
it takes a lot more it takes and I said

278
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,050
it takes more advanced mathematical

279
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:46,390
takes more advanced statistics and it

280
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:48,609
takes a lot of other things brief

281
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:52,150
history of Python I would imagine most

282
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:56,350
people know something about Python it's

283
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:58,630
basically created by this guy here he's

284
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,990
a Dutch scientist computer scientist I

285
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:04,630
think he work it for Google in the

286
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:08,440
nineties and I'm not I'm not sure about

287
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:10,870
the story did he develop the while he

288
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,110
was working at Google or he developed

289
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,850
after them not sure the name is a lots

290
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,320
of people effect I have a book I didn't

291
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,050
bring it when I have the book is has a

292
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,240
huge lizard and they think that's what

293
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,160
by that name where in fact the Pythian

294
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,960
name comes from this Scioscia's I've

295
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,500
never seen I don't know I just saw it

296
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,500
written somewhere

297
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:37,350
for more information and this is the guy

298
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:40,170
who developed the language like I said

299
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:42,290
he is a Dutch guy he's a I was talking

300
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:45,089
to my colleague here there is a name

301
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:47,010
like most people who have created

302
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,680
something like this guy created Pythian

303
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,390
people who created C++ or any other

304
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,780
languages so anything they give him a

305
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:57,000
title dictator for life and what that

306
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:00,540
means is basically this guy has the

307
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,700
final say in if there are because you

308
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,199
know Python now is Python foundation

309
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,690
they have a lot maybe hundreds of

310
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,390
thousands of people work there this guy

311
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:12,240
sits in the board of the Python

312
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:14,250
foundation and at one time he was like

313
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,960
the dictator for life but he resigned he

314
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,850
said there is no reason there are people

315
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,040
who know as much if not more about

316
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:23,730
Python why should it but it often is the

317
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:26,130
case and now the case for Python in

318
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:29,610
other words if you want to learn in just

319
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:31,860
a programming order particularly if you

320
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:34,680
want to learn in a programming to do

321
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:39,750
data science or cybersecurity why should

322
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:41,819
you consider Python because my sin is if

323
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,010
you think about it is just a programming

324
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:48,180
language there are tons of them there

325
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:50,280
are just some of these so why can't you

326
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,209
use especially the one day hearted in

327
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,949
yellow

328
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:58,980
why can't use our SAS or matlab at least

329
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:01,800
those are a few we look for the jobs for

330
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:05,130
data science almost always these are

331
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,290
they come and I forgot to put squirrel

332
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:09,960
because you really need that for

333
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:12,390
databases but these are the programming

334
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:16,290
language and again the case why why not

335
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:19,080
are why not says why not let let and the

336
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,819
answer is why not me at level and I've

337
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,790
said take some people here at what says

338
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:27,270
is a measure anybody here to assess

339
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:30,089
nobody says stands for statistical

340
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,949
analysis system this is a huge company

341
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,840
it started in the seventy by two

342
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:36,210
professors from North Carolina State

343
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,340
University and basically what they did

344
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:43,800
is the story of SAS and are almost

345
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:47,220
identical says is ok

346
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:49,560
software company are is open-source and

347
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,750
so what says and are they basically do

348
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,239
almost the same thing even their origin

349
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,890
are started as a as a basically

350
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,580
statistical group started in New Zealand

351
00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:01,980
and they ended up now in our and or says

352
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,140
you can do anything I have very little

353
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,990
experience with MATLAB but I understand

354
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:09,779
it would do just about everything so

355
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:14,870
again why not why not use one of these

356
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:17,700
and the answer is open source

357
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,800
Python is basically you can as you all

358
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,450
know you can download it in one computer

359
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,979
and you can load it in one hundred and

360
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:25,529
one computer and nobody's going to ask

361
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:30,180
you for money and nobody asking you for

362
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:32,970
a license well art is open source do so

363
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:35,849
I can't use our that's a different story

364
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:37,829
maybe other then the great scientific

365
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:41,459
and mathematical support and that is

366
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:43,589
really in my view one of the they're all

367
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:47,239
I mean over sources if you if you know

368
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:50,010
the how much says and MATLAB cost and

369
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,690
they charge you for everything they get

370
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:55,079
to the point where they could charge you

371
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:56,940
by the modules and they have very very

372
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:58,979
complicated license process and

373
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,600
everything go so nobody really want to

374
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,199
use them and only people who use an

375
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,939
errand I mean MATLAB and says are multi

376
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,669
billion and million company that you

377
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,829
know what 50 100 or 200 thousand dollars

378
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:12,660
a year make a difference to them and so

379
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,938
they have some people who invested in

380
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,520
SAS or MATLAB and they said yeah we can

381
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:19,890
do it but their share if you look at in

382
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,770
data science or in general very very

383
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:24,569
very small compared to RSS and this is

384
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,309
really what I thinks it's about at

385
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:28,889
Python more than anything the scientific

386
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:31,350
and mathematical support in fact that is

387
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:34,140
really the backbone of by that I will

388
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:37,620
talk a little bit of the three or four

389
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:39,710
most important packages in Python which

390
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:43,199
is they call them a numerical Python

391
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:45,000
scientific Python pandas that's

392
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,490
basically like equivalent to a data

393
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,190
frame how you deal with tabulated data

394
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:52,350
and math block loop which is

395
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,500
mathematical blotting library you can do

396
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:57,600
graphs and other comprehensive and this

397
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,580
is kind of catch-22 here

398
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,129
say comprehensive that means you can do

399
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,379
just about everything compile if you

400
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,570
know by saying in your familiar you can

401
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,450
do just about everything but like

402
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:12,510
anything else even Python does not do

403
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:14,610
everything in other words it's not 100%

404
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,429
my cleaner and I'll just tell you a

405
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:19,709
story that has actually happened to me

406
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:21,150
about five years ago six years ago I was

407
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,789
working a project and I was in a

408
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:25,980
discussion group with somebody who were

409
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:29,370
using our and he asked the question

410
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:32,400
about something something called the

411
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,899
quadratic program gets a and he said he

412
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,090
really wanted to do they see what's in a

413
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,520
project and he couldn't do it and I and

414
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:40,139
I said well you can do it Empire and

415
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,139
here is and he said I don't know how to

416
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:45,539
use paisa and their question therefore

417
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,340
is especially if you are working in a

418
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:49,799
company that these days it changes you

419
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,220
never so can you rely heavily in PI

420
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,870
thing

421
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,549
can you bit everything you have in

422
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,199
Python and then guess what you get stuck

423
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,929
and you may not you may not be able to

424
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,669
and so what the solution the solution is

425
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:02,250
always to keep something on the side

426
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:04,559
just in case that's is the best thing I

427
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:07,650
would say goodbye then it would do I'm

428
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,990
just guessing a 95 to 99 percent to

429
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,460
whatever you need to do it's just you

430
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,440
may get somewhere between one and five

431
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,179
percent when a project that may not do

432
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,500
what you want to do and therefore you

433
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:21,720
could start teetering or support as the

434
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,610
old no sass and math lab the commercial

435
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,230
software they have a lot of basically

436
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,820
their charge for everything if you want

437
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:30,059
support they'll serve will they give it

438
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,799
to you in Python it's basically since

439
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:34,860
it's open source you can actually get

440
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:38,429
the loss of support if you starting by

441
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:40,918
hand today as long as you have an idea

442
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:42,960
and you ask the right question you can

443
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:46,320
almost always get the answer within some

444
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,820
time is really an hour or maybe at most

445
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,168
of a day or two and you get a sudden you

446
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,840
get good answer and you can solve what

447
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:54,510
you need to do now this is something

448
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:59,250
that is as as far as I see it is a

449
00:19:54,510 --> 00:20:01,260
little bit not very good in Python and

450
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,750
not only my own experience but I intend

451
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:07,379
to somewhere by then because it has a

452
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:09,240
lots of other packages that comes with

453
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,870
it and they have to be compatible and

454
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,210
sometimes it's very hairy

455
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:16,300
to to find a package sometimes they may

456
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,860
not work sometimes they for Allah and it

457
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,770
just takes a lot of time I remember the

458
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:23,169
first time I try to install Python and

459
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,210
all its excuse me

460
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:26,380
it took me for a long long time to get

461
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,660
it done and if you don't have experience

462
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,550
with these things in fact they by

463
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,520
telling them self says if you want to

464
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:35,080
get even an IDE if you don't have

465
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,629
experience it takes some time to get

466
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:42,699
these things these are now is basically

467
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:44,770
what they the world overall design of

468
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,300
Python it's a major useful ROM thumbies

469
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:48,610
and I think this should this should

470
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,919
apply for every language not just for by

471
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,870
then I think if you are writing code it

472
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,570
doesn't matter what code it is it's

473
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:58,540
important first do try to make sure that

474
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:01,090
your program correctly then worry about

475
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,740
efficiency I think that that that make

476
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:06,370
references you can't worry about versus

477
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:10,000
if you program is not working by design

478
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:12,010
implement delivery symbol syntax I think

479
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,330
if you so it's basically indentation and

480
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,309
a few other things and you are good to

481
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:18,580
go it doesn't have really complicated

482
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:20,110
syntax or anything it's deliberately

483
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,790
optimize it for speed of development

484
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,490
that's what they say if you are a

485
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:26,020
developer I'm not that mean is that you

486
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:28,030
can write a lots of things you know

487
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,650
instead of you are writing as you see a

488
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:32,050
Blas you're gonna write a lots of code

489
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:35,950
and by then you can write it in much

490
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:38,370
much much shorter and basically it's a

491
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:44,530
basically object-oriented programming

492
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:46,719
like most other languages now the Python

493
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:50,160
conceptual hierarchy and this is also

494
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:53,530
similar to a lot of other programs

495
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:55,450
programs are composed of modules and it

496
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:57,879
they should be comparable module if they

497
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,470
are not and then modules contain a

498
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,690
statement statement containing

499
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:04,660
suppression separation create and

500
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:06,880
process object and it really the last

501
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,500
number four is very important for what

502
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,120
we did today everything is basically if

503
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:14,440
you have an object you can have an

504
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:19,139
expression to process it Python major

505
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,140
built in object this is

506
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:27,640
very simple but I think there are a few

507
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:30,550
things I want to show here all right as

508
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,320
you see here numbers everybody knows

509
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:34,450
numbers you can add to these

510
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,879
I think complex numbers and lots of

511
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:40,420
other numbers you have strings and you

512
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,970
have lists dictionary I heard it the

513
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,010
last one is pronounced what some people

514
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,950
pronounce a tuple some people pronounce

515
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:49,629
a double rancid anyway you want it

516
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,070
doesn't really make a difference as long

517
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:54,040
as you know what it is and then you have

518
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,750
files sits sits as you all know if

519
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,909
anybody heard anything about math math

520
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:01,000
because that's a mathematical term it

521
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:03,010
has some uses in Python or special uses

522
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,950
but what I want is the one that

523
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:08,110
highlighted in yellow those are what

524
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:10,810
they call them by an immutable object

525
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:13,870
those are objects that you cannot a

526
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:19,960
change if you've had for example your I

527
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:23,320
I don't know a equal to sperm or hello

528
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,390
or something you cannot write it at all

529
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,280
you cannot a change you can only copy it

530
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,990
but you cannot change it if say and this

531
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,060
is really a good thing because sometime

532
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,500
is is in other language you can change

533
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,280
anything if you have something that you

534
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,500
don't want to change

535
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,149
just put it in either an a string or a

536
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,240
topple and it will not change it will

537
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:43,090
always there whatever you need it the

538
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:47,230
other thing is you see the red one those

539
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:50,139
are sequences and by definition sequence

540
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:54,460
is basically something like like a

541
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:57,070
series of boys 4 1 2 3 4 2 4 6 and so on

542
00:23:54,460 --> 00:24:00,280
and so forth and the good thing about

543
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:03,700
them these two objective is that you can

544
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,290
basically offset them by stepping

545
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:09,610
through them in other words you can go 1

546
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:13,780
2 3 2 4 6 a 3 6 9 and so on and so forth

547
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:16,540
so these are the major I'm not going to

548
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:19,480
talk much about files dictionaries and

549
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:23,050
lists and particularly lists are very

550
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,940
very far the most versatile object in

551
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:29,230
Python are listed in dictionary and

552
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:34,110
because both are mutable so you can

553
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:34,110
change anything you want oops

554
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:40,909
yeah I get methods this is just a

555
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:44,539
theorem is basically what a method is

556
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:47,090
basically since these are all objects so

557
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:50,119
if you have a string for example object

558
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:52,279
you need a special function that process

559
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:54,889
and work on that object if you have

560
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:56,570
numbers you need a special function that

561
00:24:54,889 --> 00:24:58,178
work for that object the Sun and so

562
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:02,450
forth and that's basically what they are

563
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:07,129
methods are function looks like I missed

564
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:09,889
the F there that are attached it to an

565
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:11,899
act of a specific object which are

566
00:25:09,889 --> 00:25:16,719
negated with a call expression and we

567
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:19,879
will see and we will see example of this

568
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,859
now this is a like say the fact that if

569
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:25,099
you remember which one is mutable and

570
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:27,710
which one is immutable you can in the

571
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:29,418
real exercises we have here shortly you

572
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:32,979
can see if something you don't try to

573
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:32,979
change and you will get an error message

574
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:40,460
symbol of expression operator and

575
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:43,369
precedence this is basically like most

576
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:51,049
other language it's the same I'm very

577
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:54,320
sure most of you know these xfy LZ x or

578
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:58,849
y x and y naught x x and y x not in Y

579
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:01,249
it's in is Y X is not Y and those are

580
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:03,889
the little things I think what one thing

581
00:26:01,249 --> 00:26:05,659
is in some languages but somebody don't

582
00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:08,238
have the two equal sign next to each

583
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:10,580
other and if they have the two equal

584
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:11,659
sign and one equal sign you know even if

585
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,949
you don't know what they mean you know

586
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:18,919
they mean different things that

587
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:23,299
basically common sequence operation so

588
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:25,009
we said if I go back to the what I told

589
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:26,479
you a sequence so you have if you have a

590
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:30,679
sequence you have come and operation

591
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:35,450
then it basically now one thing I will

592
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:38,210
point out is it's plus T in lots of

593
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:41,059
language you can utterly add text you

594
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:43,389
can you cannot add strings but in Python

595
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:46,580
you can basically couldn't get

596
00:26:43,389 --> 00:26:48,379
concatenation of the two you can

597
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,678
multiply we can do all different kinds

598
00:26:48,379 --> 00:26:51,529
of

599
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:53,990
so those are some of the that this one

600
00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:59,990
here is I probably that's just basically

601
00:26:53,990 --> 00:27:03,230
indexing so if you have say it's a spam

602
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:04,580
and you have it or equal to spam and you

603
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:06,769
have it's the one it'll give you the

604
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,449
first letter or a sub zero it will give

605
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:10,789
you there the first letters it by ten

606
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:15,200
starts from zero instead of one so the

607
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:18,529
leftmost 1 is 0 1 2 3 this is again is

608
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:22,129
basically arranged this is arranged with

609
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:26,690
offset and this is you probably can

610
00:27:22,129 --> 00:27:31,369
guess what's the Lin is the Lin is a

611
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:34,460
function for the length min is and I

612
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:38,269
want you to watch this on Max and watch

613
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:40,340
now you have in the first reel in min

614
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:44,629
and Max everybody knows what min and Max

615
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:47,869
but you see then it's not count that is

616
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:50,480
one of the methods for string for the s

617
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:52,850
if you want to have anything so a total

618
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,289
number of accounts of X and s basically

619
00:27:52,850 --> 00:28:00,649
you counted and that will become a

620
00:27:54,289 --> 00:28:07,100
method now operation in mutable sequence

621
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:12,018
types again you can see those are very

622
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:13,789
similar again you see now when you see

623
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:16,730
it's clear that means now it become a

624
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:19,580
method cubby and all those kinds is now

625
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:25,340
these are methods operate on this object

626
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:27,678
only insert the same thing populate the

627
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:30,499
same thing it's just basically if you

628
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,480
have the right object it'll operate on

629
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:33,919
it and of course if you don't have the

630
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:39,950
right object it'll give you an error

631
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:43,009
message samples have built-in function

632
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:47,269
that's one thing is I looked at the last

633
00:28:43,009 --> 00:28:51,320
available Python and it has visited my

634
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:52,999
counting it has about 69 function that

635
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,330
basically standard function these are

636
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:57,320
just work with the everything this is

637
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,359
the sum of them

638
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:02,730
I'm just going to show you like maybe

639
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:06,840
the last one them X and that

640
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:09,030
a function you can get the max but it

641
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,189
doesn't apply it's kind of like a a

642
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:13,170
method but it's not really a method you

643
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:15,480
don't have to have the dot in it the max

644
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:17,160
if you get a max of a string and you're

645
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:22,140
not going to get anything because it

646
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:24,450
doesn't have any max their name

647
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,250
reference object that's one of the

648
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:28,410
things when I learned started learning

649
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,930
by hand this really kind of confused me

650
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:33,330
they said and what I used to know

651
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,860
so for example if you write this in

652
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:37,139
there and you will write that say a

653
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:40,110
equal to three you know in most

654
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:43,200
languages a basically a is a variable

655
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:46,159
and its value as a C and the interpreter

656
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:51,690
whatever it sees 8 was the C in it in

657
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:53,280
this case as integer how about this in a

658
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,170
lots of language if you know something

659
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,180
if you do something like this especially

660
00:29:55,170 --> 00:30:00,810
language that requires you to declare

661
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:04,530
your your variables you'll get an error

662
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:06,330
message right in other words how come a

663
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:10,470
is a number integer and now he told me a

664
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:12,629
is string you get but in Python because

665
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:17,220
it's dynamically tired it doesn't matter

666
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:22,220
so now it's a string how about now now

667
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:29,010
this is a float point looking buoyant so

668
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:31,080
how is how that is put in the memory and

669
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:34,110
this is the vector so basically you see

670
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:37,080
the 3 is the object and the object

671
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:39,149
really doesn't care what the name of it

672
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,310
just the object lives in with object so

673
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:43,200
you can call it anything you want the

674
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:45,270
only thing is in the first in the a

675
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:52,260
basically points to the object or a

676
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:55,470
reference to the object now how about

677
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:58,620
this one now if we're going to do the

678
00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:02,240
same thing here is a equal to 3 and now

679
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:06,479
say B is equal to a how that works now

680
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:10,230
which one is the object and which one is

681
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,150
the reference here is how it works it's

682
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:16,110
basically the object didn't change is

683
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:21,299
just now it has two names and it depends

684
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:23,790
in where you are in the program shared

685
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:27,059
reference part two now you have a equal

686
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:30,870
to 3 you have B equal to a and now you

687
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:32,760
have a equal to spare that is for

688
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:34,909
somebody like I said who comes from a

689
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:39,120
language where you have to declare your

690
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:42,840
variable this is very confusing so what

691
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:47,010
this means here if you look at it for a

692
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:51,750
little bit so where is the object and

693
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:53,400
how you reference these things anybody

694
00:31:51,750 --> 00:32:05,990
seen this before some of you may have

695
00:31:53,400 --> 00:32:05,990
seen this there is your answer

696
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:13,470
it's basically what happened is now we

697
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:19,350
switch you know the B 3 was referenced

698
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:27,510
by B and a is the difference span this

699
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:30,480
is just like sit all right that's it I'm

700
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:32,429
done for the first part so thanks for

701
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,140
listening for and we'll take a like a

702
00:32:32,429 --> 00:32:36,720
very short break 5 minutes or something

703
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:38,820
and then I have like think what I'm

704
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,910
gonna do I have a bunch of code like I

705
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,899
said most of it's very simple you can

706
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:45,179
when I put it here

707
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,100
I'll ask you if you want to put it in

708
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:49,980
your interpreter whatever interpreter

709
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:52,620
you have and see if you know see what

710
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:56,370
what what you see in and I were done -

711
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:58,168
well here - any questions likes it and I

712
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:02,070
don't know how much what time is it now

713
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:04,830
or what ok so I think I'm almost I'm

714
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:06,570
almost on time so I think we can take

715
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:08,370
like sit 5 or 10 minutes that's I think

716
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,470
the plan I have five or ten minutes

717
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:13,860
break and then we'll go back and we'll

718
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:16,980
run some code to type these two things

719
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:19,350
and I'm gonna type in in in in you see

720
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,049
here is an even if I I can do this if I

721
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:23,760
want so at least that's all what you see

722
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:26,780
just type in there and your introvert

723
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,780
and see what it tells you

724
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:52,679
and then what does it say I'm gonna ask

725
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:58,560
you just type it in your interpreter

726
00:33:52,680 --> 00:34:01,190
like I do here and it's a false what's

727
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,190
wrong with this thing

728
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:08,310
no there is no parenthesis here think

729
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:11,159
about it a little bit and what I'm going

730
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:12,929
to do is actually I always I thought and

731
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,389
I still think that the greats the best

732
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:17,339
way to learn make your own mistakes and

733
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:19,440
trust me I'm here and I can guarantee

734
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:21,330
you if you think somebody's going to

735
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,429
teach you programming it's gone it's

736
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:25,319
what people can give you like general

737
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:30,359
guidelines that they're learning it's

738
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:35,910
you have to do it in your own so I want

739
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:38,150
you then to run the next thing this one

740
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:38,149
here

741
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:48,629
just hit enter and see what you get

742
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,629
maybe you will find out the answer why

743
00:34:54,989 --> 00:35:02,080
Shh mister you don't give the answer to

744
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:08,710
people otherwise I may have to kick you

745
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:11,799
out of this class you guys didn't see

746
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:13,780
the difference because those are not the

747
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,780
same and that is what the floating-point

748
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,790
arithmetic sauron about so when you type

749
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,440
members in you know a lots of people say

750
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:23,140
well the convener doesn't work no the

751
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,570
computer doesn't work it's just numbers

752
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:29,500
are don't want to get into that but

753
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:31,510
number system of you know fraction they

754
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,100
have decimal point and if you have all

755
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,480
different kinds of numbers and what

756
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,730
happened with the computer they have to

757
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,260
basically put them in a some sort of a

758
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,910
series and convert them to a certain

759
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:42,670
number and depends also in the accuracy

760
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:44,799
and how much you birthday but at least

761
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,780
an idea when you do any deal with

762
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,700
arithmetics be careful what you're

763
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:51,340
you're dealing with and there are a lot

764
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,689
of function where you can cut numbers

765
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,760
and or lots of things so much clearer

766
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,950
here in other words the reason they are

767
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:00,369
not the same yet they're be the same

768
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:02,230
because they're floating point

769
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:03,880
arithmetic and how computer represent

770
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:07,200
numbers so at least you should be aware

771
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:12,100
of this am i clear here okay

772
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:16,089
how about you do the next thing now and

773
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:24,700
I'm going to go just died there five

774
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:28,780
there the next thing here and so you

775
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:30,700
have L equal to and equal to just tie

776
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:33,450
them and see what what you get what what

777
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,450
answers you did

778
00:36:54,340 --> 00:37:00,100
you got some answers right well I'm

779
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:00,100
gonna give you a minute to type or

780
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:26,120
I can type in my interpreter now so you

781
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:26,120
have them all in textile Aiken whoops

782
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,690
that's heaven here there you go sir

783
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:02,569
so if I type ill that gives me same

784
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,460
thing now you guys I want you to tell me

785
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:11,010
what did what what what the computer

786
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:13,680
says says an error so what kind of

787
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:18,090
mistakes I have here that's your job to

788
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:20,100
figure it out no I'm not you talking no

789
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:24,090
no no you have no job here mister

790
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:26,839
the job is for the list of people so

791
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:30,630
what's wrong here

792
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:33,240
very good him is not Defiance right so

793
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:38,970
basically he says if I write here and

794
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:43,740
some of these done now is you'll agree

795
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:56,100
mate work alright try now write m equal

796
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:58,140
to L and if I tried here in my because I

797
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,630
didn't I didn't define him here I didn't

798
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:04,440
copy it here but you see the point here

799
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:06,660
right now is can somebody tell me what

800
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,700
the difference between when you will now

801
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:12,180
only write M equal to L it tilde to

802
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:15,689
write and when you write L equal to

803
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:20,250
equal to M it tells you to write what

804
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:21,990
the difference between the two what the

805
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:24,590
difference between the two equal signs

806
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:36,200
and the 1 equal sign single equal sign

807
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:39,869
and what in other words he was saying is

808
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:42,149
the single equal sign in this for object

809
00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:44,460
equality you know that the object is the

810
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:47,580
list here in this case is an object if

811
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:51,869
if you if we draw it it will be like the

812
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:54,450
list here and the the name here L and so

813
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:56,700
now when you say L equal to M basically

814
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:58,740
equality and I've already written in the

815
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:02,399
interpret and m equal to L so in terms

816
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:04,618
of object they are equal but also they

817
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,350
are equal in value in other words if you

818
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:10,040
type M it will give you a list of 1 2 3

819
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:20,569
make sensitive

820
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:20,570
okay so we'll go to the next one and

821
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:28,919
basically you can see here what I'm

822
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:33,060
going you do the I'm sorry here my text

823
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:38,930
editor is I just use neck so just a

824
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:38,930
chick if x equals the wire and if X is y

825
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:03,839
and by the way just before if I don't

826
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:06,120
forget is I'll be more than happy like

827
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:10,880
said these are very simple things but if

828
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:15,480
you are interested in learning Python or

829
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:17,700
need resources or you have any questions

830
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,040
I'll be more than happy to answer

831
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:22,770
whatever question you have and if I can

832
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:29,840
answer it I will find somebody also can

833
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:41,630
answer it so I will definitely so it is

834
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:41,630
X equal to y equal equal to Y but agree

835
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,790
and I can I can write it here and my

836
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,950
interpreter but those of you who have

837
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:51,930
interpreter I think maybe some of you

838
00:41:49,950 --> 00:42:01,640
don't have it so maybe I will write it

839
00:41:51,930 --> 00:42:01,640
here there is

840
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:21,060
and if I say X Y alright I want to live

841
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:24,180
other people to figure it themselves

842
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:27,180
semester let little figure themselves

843
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:29,100
the greatest way to learn is to learn

844
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,720
from your mistake the computer tells you

845
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,670
right away there is some mistake so

846
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:42,060
check it out figure it out that's the

847
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:44,280
whole fun about program and everybody

848
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:46,830
agree that if you have them both in same

849
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:53,130
cap the letter or small or big then they

850
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:54,920
will be the same yes no kind of it looks

851
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:58,580
like we are moving along than you will

852
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:07,560
so we'll go to the next one

853
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:09,990
this is just basically do do this learn

854
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:12,750
something in fewer just to guess

855
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:17,339
describe it as is and what do you think

856
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:19,560
Lin does iliyan this is a terrible

857
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:21,390
function because you remember your high

858
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:31,830
school math it could be a logarithm but

859
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:34,950
this is not this is not Telugu Lin

860
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:41,250
stands for short for lymph you know what

861
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:43,830
it does no right everybody and you can

862
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:51,540
basically if you want you can change it

863
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:54,150
and you will see if I get here that will

864
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:56,490
likely to give me three but if I can

865
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:59,190
change it and put whatever I want in it

866
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:02,129
and then you guess that it's gonna count

867
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:07,520
it give me the number of make sense here

868
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:11,480
again it's just very simple thing here

869
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,480
there is a one more

870
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:25,399
I want to let's say just write this

871
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:30,470
again and you have a very very symbol

872
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:33,950
for loops every language have for many

873
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:36,439
many types of loops this is for loop you

874
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:40,750
have tons of them just run that little

875
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:45,890
thing and then check out those just see

876
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:48,109
for example you say is K in my shop what

877
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:49,759
is this just write them play with it for

878
00:44:48,109 --> 00:44:59,328
a few minutes and see what you can get

879
00:44:49,760 --> 00:45:06,109
and I will run them in my you mean let's

880
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:07,970
see but that's what you want you are the

881
00:45:06,109 --> 00:45:12,009
only one who's complaining in this class

882
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:12,009
here everybody is acting nicely here

883
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:29,760
just one secondly so I'll make you

884
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,760
happier see

885
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:18,040
now the question is dissing in that is

886
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:21,880
kind of require you know but you just

887
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:24,970
write K or whatever letter you want and

888
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:44,980
then in and put the the variable name

889
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:50,470
and so if I were to run this you it did

890
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:52,920
what is supposed to do and then it's a

891
00:46:50,470 --> 00:47:01,750
is K in my job

892
00:46:52,920 --> 00:47:04,330
so basically K in my job and when you

893
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:07,080
have in in my job and the same you know

894
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:07,080
what happened right

895
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:18,899
make sense here does it make sense and

896
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:33,189
again the good thing is is I am a I

897
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:35,579
sometimes I I what I teach is I give him

898
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:37,569
something intentionally wrong and see so

899
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:39,190
something wrong good if you get an error

900
00:47:37,569 --> 00:47:44,079
message to Street the error message it

901
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:46,509
will help be great it helps me to see

902
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:49,420
what is that error message means and

903
00:47:46,509 --> 00:47:51,489
I'll tell you one of the greatest

904
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:55,150
learning things you hope you don't make

905
00:47:51,489 --> 00:47:56,920
errors but nobody everybody makes error

906
00:47:55,150 --> 00:48:00,579
so the trick is just read the error and

907
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:02,529
see if you can fix it anybody fix it it

908
00:48:00,579 --> 00:48:08,739
looks like it probably if I did it this

909
00:48:02,529 --> 00:48:11,440
way it would work better see what

910
00:48:08,739 --> 00:48:15,539
happened here because when you put care

911
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:18,309
without but without the quotation Marcus

912
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:20,019
Python doesn't understand what is this

913
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:24,759
this doesn't look like a text

914
00:48:20,019 --> 00:48:31,598
there's mixes now and then you can check

915
00:48:24,759 --> 00:48:33,880
the other ones like I said this might be

916
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:37,809
too easy but as we go along it gets a

917
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:40,690
little bit more interesting is that that

918
00:48:37,809 --> 00:48:43,239
that that very straightforward and I

919
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:46,509
will wait a little bit if you typing and

920
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:48,749
by the way I can make up the I can

921
00:48:46,509 --> 00:48:55,690
increase the font if it's not big enough

922
00:48:48,749 --> 00:49:04,379
yeah see I don't know if this has font

923
00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:07,239
or not format I found here okay got you

924
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:12,660
so how about we make it a humongous is

925
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:12,660
that big enough maybe too big

926
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:31,040
yeah good thank you and again one more

927
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:34,600
time if like said if anybody is

928
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:38,210
interested in learning about Python or

929
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:40,370
data science or even have a computer

930
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:42,980
scientist here we'll be happy to talk to

931
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:44,930
you it after that class you need

932
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:47,260
anything when you can help we'll be more

933
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:50,319
than happy to do so

934
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:54,010
this give you an advice or an opinion or

935
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:57,560
is that clear so far

936
00:49:54,010 --> 00:50:00,250
almost everybody finish this right we go

937
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,250
to the next one

938
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:10,370
just do this again do do this here just

939
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:14,540
type them as they are if you have Isis

940
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:17,299
pair type is 0 type is to the negative 2

941
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:20,660
and I don't need to tell you but you

942
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:23,390
just type them if you don't know type

943
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:26,359
them and see what they get you and you

944
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:29,629
will have an idea so do all the four of

945
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:32,600
them and it would be actually best if

946
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:35,480
you can predict or at least guess what

947
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:37,460
would what this will give me and if you

948
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:39,800
can't predict it I think that will that

949
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:43,210
would help because that will help you

950
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,210
understand these type six

951
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:59,109
now in some language they don't have

952
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:00,790
negative indexing but you could have

953
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:03,880
probably guessed it even if you've never

954
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:06,670
seen it if it's positive indexing it

955
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:08,860
goes from left to right you guess it

956
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:09,610
negative in Dixon will become the other

957
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:13,240
way around

958
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:15,670
it'll goes from right to left but try

959
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:18,069
them all and before you hit the enter

960
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:20,440
please just just guess a what letter is

961
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:22,090
going to give me or what modulator is

962
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,810
going to give me and see what what what

963
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:24,810
they actually do

964
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:51,550
like I can privateer in my interpreter

965
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:53,110
and see what the one thing is with the

966
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:55,900
Python interpreter you cannot have a

967
00:51:53,110 --> 00:52:01,360
clear and clear screen and this is

968
00:51:55,900 --> 00:52:04,570
really a bummer because actually last

969
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:07,810
slide this guy here and I he actually

970
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:10,210
wrote a function that you can clear the

971
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:12,580
screen but you have to exit the

972
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:14,470
interpreter every time before so it kind

973
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:16,600
of defeats the person but but that is a

974
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:18,250
very good thing for somebody to do it in

975
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,660
10-15 minutes you know find a function

976
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:22,390
that will clear scheme because that

977
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:26,620
really it helps now is you either have

978
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:29,799
to do it if okay so I'm just gonna write

979
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:35,470
the same here let's say I'm gonna write

980
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:38,140
these two so here is basically you have

981
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:39,730
and you can guess that here is zero I

982
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:41,460
mean this is something you must be able

983
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:44,320
to guess would that be fair enough is

984
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:52,140
that it should do is zero that mean is

985
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:56,290
the very first one make sense here and

986
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:57,940
then you can guess it if you try if I'm

987
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:59,500
not even but if it is to the negative

988
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:01,030
two what that will give you I'll just

989
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:14,110
maybe do one with the negative thing

990
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:15,760
here maybe I'll do more why not so it

991
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:20,010
just gets like which letter is going to

992
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:24,990
give me and if you get stroke so what

993
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:27,619
make sense here Surtr

994
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:31,259
all right what what

995
00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:33,359
giving a write an egg if you start from

996
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:36,030
the right and count one two which one

997
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:41,670
will give you it'll give you a make

998
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:43,680
sense here everybody all right I'm going

999
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:45,600
to land I think this is one two three

1000
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,549
you probably guessed it give me one two

1001
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:51,270
and three

1002
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:53,100
yes and then one and two everything that

1003
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:55,250
mean is start from one then go and

1004
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:57,569
basically it that will give you

1005
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:59,130
everything except the first letter

1006
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:01,230
because the first letter start with zero

1007
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:03,720
that's one thing is also when I first

1008
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:05,760
started by saying learning Python is I

1009
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:08,040
have everything they knew before it

1010
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,080
starts with one and now we started with

1011
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:13,950
zero it's just it just basically replace

1012
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:15,900
everything then how about the last one

1013
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:17,819
let's say you don't remember the last

1014
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:20,369
one and you can think about it is kind

1015
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:24,170
of the opposite of the one in the middle

1016
00:54:20,369 --> 00:54:24,170
but let's try the the last one

1017
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:42,180
so it's a everything from negative 1 in

1018
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:50,330
the front give me everything would that

1019
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:55,410
be fair enough that's what they expected

1020
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:59,220
kind of Sarada not love quiet no think

1021
00:54:55,410 --> 00:55:01,379
about it is it will give you it will

1022
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:02,339
give you a remember when you go from

1023
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:05,160
right to left

1024
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:07,410
it's a the first one the very far in

1025
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,118
there in the in the right

1026
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:12,379
I don't want it doesn't give me the rest

1027
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:15,960
of it just give us PA mix us now

1028
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:21,720
everybody here okay

1029
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:25,200
we'll move on to the next step you can

1030
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:28,169
probably again guess this but go ahead

1031
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:33,210
and this is I would say this it since

1032
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:35,640
it's a kind of bunch of nonsense right

1033
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:37,470
anything you want as long as you say it

1034
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,049
I'm saying here you don't have to write

1035
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:42,029
exactly what I have in screen but verse

1036
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:45,180
things as long as you have them

1037
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:48,839
character or more it works mixes here

1038
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:54,330
but you have try to try to write it and

1039
00:55:48,839 --> 00:55:57,980
see ABCD efg hijk so just all the Alpha

1040
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:57,980
alphabet letter is a sir

1041
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:28,000
that very very straightforward again

1042
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:30,580
this is basically a string and string is

1043
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:36,030
a sequence and sequence you can index it

1044
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:40,440
as a enlists is that is that clear her

1045
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:42,730
everybody's so far so good

1046
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:46,240
anybody wants me to run these just to

1047
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:48,340
see um how many like if you get if you

1048
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:51,879
have to take it this if you didn't run

1049
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:52,900
the first one they say is 110 to what do

1050
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,359
you think that means

1051
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,140
if you run it you know what it means am

1052
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:59,740
i clear here

1053
00:56:56,140 --> 00:57:01,540
it basically says go from 2010 and every

1054
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:02,680
- every second one give it to me

1055
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:04,810
don't give me the first give me the

1056
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:07,440
second give me the four of the six and

1057
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:09,840
so on and so forth make sense here

1058
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:14,920
that's the idea here

1059
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:15,930
and one of the last thing if we get to

1060
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:19,570
it

1061
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:22,180
like the power of when it comes to math

1062
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:25,450
and statistics you need really a lots of

1063
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:27,040
processing power and the and you need

1064
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:27,819
what they call a method C's will have

1065
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,790
one here

1066
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:32,830
you know most of anything that 2d or

1067
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:35,230
more you need matrices for it and

1068
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:38,160
sometimes you get huge matrices and so

1069
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:41,230
they have what they called Nami

1070
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:44,319
numpy or numpy which is really short for

1071
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:46,839
a numerical Python and it has all these

1072
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,190
kinds of very fancy indexing you can

1073
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:50,080
basically do all different

1074
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:51,670
fortunately we don't have time to get to

1075
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:54,190
it but anyway that is that clear hair

1076
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:59,530
folks I can run it here in my maybe I'll

1077
00:57:54,190 --> 00:58:01,720
run it just for fun and I think this

1078
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:05,680
should run them all together all the

1079
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:10,169
same here everybody got with the same

1080
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:10,169
thing here if you run them all

1081
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:31,629
any questions about this all right we'll

1082
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:36,339
move on then again this is all about

1083
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:41,020
indexing I want Italy I think for people

1084
00:58:36,339 --> 00:58:43,000
who who are hora new dishes this will be

1085
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:47,009
very interesting for many reasons so try

1086
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,010
to run it and see what he did

1087
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:24,620
and again whenever you get an error

1088
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:27,410
message it just that it tells you there

1089
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:29,799
is something not working so what right

1090
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:29,799
again

1091
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:08,119
I will we're gonna give you shot here to

1092
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:14,779
run it yourself and I'm gonna run it see

1093
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:25,670
what we can get out of here uh-huh

1094
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:27,230
a problem now anybody has an idea which

1095
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:43,280
is she don't that's perfectly okay

1096
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:48,260
what's wrong here very good point

1097
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:51,140
he says things are immutable object you

1098
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:54,080
cannot change them and that's exactly

1099
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:55,940
what you get basically what you're

1100
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:58,098
trying to do here is you're trying to

1101
01:00:55,940 --> 01:01:01,609
change something that is immutable it

1102
01:00:58,099 --> 01:01:04,010
cannot be changed so that error message

1103
01:01:01,609 --> 01:01:05,330
has a very let's say if you forget or

1104
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:08,119
something here their message to you

1105
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:09,980
cannot do that it just it's good to know

1106
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:12,470
that it that that's the reason because

1107
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:14,359
now you know if I will do this the same

1108
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:15,859
thing to a couple it will give me the

1109
01:01:14,359 --> 01:01:20,210
same thing because these are the two

1110
01:01:15,859 --> 01:01:24,109
immutable object but if you know the

1111
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:27,050
second one is what's the difference

1112
01:01:24,109 --> 01:01:29,839
between spam and burger but do it and

1113
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:31,400
see what you get the last one if you if

1114
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:38,359
you didn't one shoot it it's basically

1115
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:40,099
right is four and then a blast we're

1116
01:01:38,359 --> 01:01:41,990
gonna blast you know you'll agree that

1117
01:01:40,099 --> 01:01:43,250
you probably if you program another

1118
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:44,930
language you never seen something like

1119
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:48,710
this at least and the other one you

1120
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:50,629
cannot add up these texts but look at go

1121
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:52,220
ahead private NSE and you don't have to

1122
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:55,089
type Burger type whatever you want by

1123
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:58,580
anything ABC and see what it will do as

1124
01:01:55,089 --> 01:02:01,790
long as you know what is the first index

1125
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:04,779
in what the first basically list and the

1126
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:04,779
last list do

1127
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:20,009
and again I will run it here in a minute

1128
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:20,010
or two and my interpreter

1129
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,960
you

1130
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:50,000
and I actually was going to bring a very

1131
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:51,830
big data file and just let people

1132
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,360
practice that the problem is how can you

1133
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:56,240
send it to a lots of people that you

1134
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:57,830
don't know and it's a and it is just

1135
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:00,200
difficult to share but that would

1136
01:02:57,830 --> 01:03:01,549
because that word really you can learn

1137
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:04,819
all different kinds of things not just

1138
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:06,080
you but this is at least for now is

1139
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:12,010
everybody done with this

1140
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:17,630
let me I'm just going to type this and

1141
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:22,040
now tell me why this works if I right

1142
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:29,600
now is why this works but the previous

1143
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:31,700
one didn't work in other words what you

1144
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:33,740
did here is you didn't change the the

1145
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:35,600
the object itself you just add a

1146
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:38,569
something and you give it a new name so

1147
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:40,580
basically now it's the same variable it

1148
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:43,520
basically refers to different object

1149
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:46,910
it's just an by both are immutable mixes

1150
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:49,070
here and that's almost two and the last

1151
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:52,520
thing is really is just basically adding

1152
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:54,110
up stuff the last work maybe editor just

1153
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:58,910
think about it for a second individual

1154
01:03:54,110 --> 01:04:01,550
credit so here is at and I will speak

1155
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:03,560
from personal experience and in the past

1156
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:05,000
is when I see this and I said this is

1157
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:09,020
the worst thing I've ever seen that you

1158
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:11,840
can't add these things but you can this

1159
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:15,020
is just the way so if I type this one

1160
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:17,150
here you're probably at least you should

1161
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:19,340
be able to say well this is basically it

1162
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:22,160
gives me part of that object this object

1163
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:25,720
and then another edit Burger and it

1164
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,720
added something else want to see what

1165
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:36,859
this is what you get and basically you

1166
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:38,990
just that part of the new spam not the

1167
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:42,620
old spend the spam with whether or the

1168
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:45,850
letter and then you mix to it burger you

1169
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:47,380
just combine all the three of them and

1170
01:04:45,850 --> 01:04:49,630
this is

1171
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:52,300
again as you can see here most of what

1172
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:53,560
we did is we do it with this and it's

1173
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:55,240
hard to remember anything but the

1174
01:04:53,560 --> 01:05:00,279
squared squared parentheses are for

1175
01:04:55,240 --> 01:05:05,919
lists and so all right let's do a little

1176
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:09,070
bit more the only thing I will say about

1177
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:12,040
this here is the point about this this

1178
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:14,680
piece here is very very simple thing

1179
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:18,430
this is where we get two methods and

1180
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:20,710
there are tons of methods you see if you

1181
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:22,810
I have been teaching for a while and

1182
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:24,700
also taken a lots of classes and I

1183
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:26,590
always loved it well before somebody

1184
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:30,839
said you remember I said no I don't

1185
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:30,840
remember you know it's been long time so

1186
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:36,970
this is where ever there is adopt

1187
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:39,240
something that's lower method because

1188
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:41,830
those are specific string methods and

1189
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:43,930
basically they do the job terrors for

1190
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:46,960
example he listed here it replaced

1191
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:49,000
something and if you just type it in it

1192
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,500
will replace whatever you want to

1193
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,160
replace with whatever you give it to

1194
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,160
replace with

1195
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:19,609
alright let's go to the next one

1196
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:22,670
well you guess that probably the next

1197
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:27,499
one you don't even need to do it that'd

1198
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:37,269
be fair enough maybe the same how about

1199
01:06:27,499 --> 01:06:40,220
now we'll go I don't finish ok this is

1200
01:06:37,269 --> 01:06:47,808
also kind of interesting for people who

1201
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:51,950
haven't just write this and again it's a

1202
01:06:47,809 --> 01:06:55,190
play since this is like a honey it's

1203
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:59,808
just an educational type thing try to

1204
01:06:55,190 --> 01:07:02,359
guess what is it given me or what would

1205
01:06:59,809 --> 01:07:04,900
it give me before you hit the enter just

1206
01:07:02,359 --> 01:07:04,900
try to guess

1207
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:20,299
clearly the first one should be very

1208
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:22,399
straightforward would we agree that's

1209
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:24,500
one of the main function in there

1210
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:28,160
basically the base function that those

1211
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:30,220
69 Lin stands for length that if you did

1212
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:36,259
everything right it should give you a 3

1213
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:38,509
the first statement but I'm really

1214
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:40,430
interested in the law the third and the

1215
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:43,310
fall of the statement and please try to

1216
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:45,350
guess before you hit enter just try to

1217
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:49,420
guess if you're gonna try to get it

1218
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:49,420
right if not you know something new so

1219
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:58,689
what okay just you've already done it

1220
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:04,960
this oh the third and the fourth sorry

1221
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:16,189
did you type it in well yeah just type

1222
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:24,770
it and hit enter and see what you get

1223
01:08:16,189 --> 01:08:26,929
all right you get that and then I know

1224
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:28,640
it's kind of hard for you guys to type

1225
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:30,920
these things it would be much better

1226
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:34,009
like I said unfortunately I have no way

1227
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:37,489
of giving you all these did you guys see

1228
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:40,399
it and one thing is I also can tell you

1229
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:44,389
from experience when you do programming

1230
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:46,460
is you never get frustrated or you

1231
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:48,460
should never get really I said I don't

1232
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:51,380
know what to do so this is not working

1233
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:54,770
sometime is it just like it doesn't work

1234
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:56,210
now five minutes later it just did type

1235
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:58,549
it in and said what's happened what did

1236
01:08:56,210 --> 01:09:05,000
I do and it just that the way it works

1237
01:08:58,549 --> 01:09:07,488
is correct everybody got these here let

1238
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:13,460
me just you probably guessed it what

1239
01:09:07,488 --> 01:09:15,379
this will do here this statement it's

1240
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:18,649
basically all what it is you are adding

1241
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:20,900
two letters that'd be fair enough so

1242
01:09:18,649 --> 01:09:24,108
guess what that's what it does it just

1243
01:09:20,899 --> 01:09:26,120
basically added the two the two letters

1244
01:09:24,109 --> 01:09:29,600
that be fair enough you just concatenate

1245
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:29,839
the two lists am i clear here the next

1246
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,510
two

1247
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:34,160
is again what I remember when I first

1248
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:38,480
looked at this stuff I just kind of

1249
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:46,399
threw me off I said what is this but now

1250
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:48,559
at least you see what it does it

1251
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:51,920
basically gave you the three keys it

1252
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:54,890
gives you one list even though it looks

1253
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:58,400
from it's basically a muster one element

1254
01:09:54,890 --> 01:10:00,440
in this case it basically repeated the

1255
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:03,679
element itself and yet is still one last

1256
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:05,179
am i clear here some other ways and I

1257
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:07,640
don't know if you have timers you

1258
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:10,460
actually can get them a bunch of lists

1259
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:14,150
next to each other in other words in a

1260
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:17,930
way you can do this is by duplicating or

1261
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:21,530
replicating the the list itself so this

1262
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:23,360
is this is again that probably in many

1263
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:29,389
other languages doesn't make sense if

1264
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:31,370
you do this you see what I guess in this

1265
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:34,190
case is just like concatenate couple of

1266
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:36,880
them and that just that's the way

1267
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:41,269
they're the the Glenridge is designed

1268
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:43,100
that again the aim here as I said it

1269
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:51,190
just get them to get see a lots of

1270
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:55,370
things and and here is again you want

1271
01:10:51,190 --> 01:10:57,589
this is like the in function and it's

1272
01:10:55,370 --> 01:11:00,460
like anything is basically you can guess

1273
01:10:57,590 --> 01:11:00,460
what the answer is and

1274
01:11:08,099 --> 01:11:13,920
this is a very very simple for loop it

1275
01:11:11,579 --> 01:11:16,079
just when you just go through like any

1276
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:25,849
loops sequential you go one two three

1277
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:29,130
four and until you get the final one and

1278
01:11:25,849 --> 01:11:31,560
this is the structure and Python the

1279
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:33,810
indenting that is you know that's all

1280
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:36,900
there what I did is I thought with these

1281
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:38,849
and basically a text editor and I

1282
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:41,009
indented themselves but in a lots of

1283
01:11:38,849 --> 01:11:42,690
Python editors they will do the

1284
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:46,980
indenting for you and everything go so

1285
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:49,980
you or not and I'm going to do something

1286
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:54,259
in fact right now I'm gonna change

1287
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:57,919
something and see you guys if he told me

1288
01:11:54,260 --> 01:12:03,840
will it work or not and before please

1289
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:04,110
before you are do you think this will

1290
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,880
work

1291
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:10,610
don't run it just do you think this will

1292
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:13,260
work and the good thing about computers

1293
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:14,880
you don't have to think you just put it

1294
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:18,179
in and see what the computer does you

1295
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:22,710
might make a sense here do you think it

1296
01:12:18,179 --> 01:12:26,010
works okay and there isn't very obvious

1297
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:27,719
right because I'm Python the indenting

1298
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:29,429
is very very important in other words

1299
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:31,949
like this it doesn't understand you have

1300
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:33,810
for loop would expect there is something

1301
01:12:31,949 --> 01:12:35,669
underneath the for loops and therefore

1302
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:42,690
there is no indenting is that it's a

1303
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:48,560
mistake I hope we'll get this is kind of

1304
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:52,379
a new thing I want you to look at this

1305
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:55,770
just basically the first one you just

1306
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:58,889
look at it and this is it comes after a

1307
01:12:55,770 --> 01:13:01,860
very very important concepts in Python

1308
01:12:58,889 --> 01:13:06,719
so what do you think the difference here

1309
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:11,429
if you do it's a is equal to C x for for

1310
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:17,329
C in spam this looks like a loop would

1311
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:17,329
really be but why in this form

1312
01:13:18,179 --> 01:13:25,889
is a very important part of price and

1313
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:29,610
it's called comprehension and it's

1314
01:13:25,889 --> 01:13:32,340
easier it's faster it's more compact

1315
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:35,848
than a four loop or wire loop or

1316
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:38,039
anything but to try it and I think the

1317
01:13:35,849 --> 01:13:40,889
word trial both of them and you see they

1318
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:43,619
are the same they should give you the

1319
01:13:40,889 --> 01:13:45,179
same result so try both of them don't

1320
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:46,829
don't worry about the comment just

1321
01:13:45,179 --> 01:13:48,719
basically type the first one or if you

1322
01:13:46,829 --> 01:13:50,759
want me you guys are fire fire

1323
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,409
inscribing I can just think about it for

1324
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,949
a minute and I'll I'll put it in the

1325
01:13:52,409 --> 01:13:54,949
interpreter

1326
01:14:23,369 --> 01:14:30,938
it would probably be better if you do

1327
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:33,760
the for the loop first because now the

1328
01:14:30,939 --> 01:14:35,919
lube you'll understand at least we'll

1329
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:38,679
have a better idea when needed the

1330
01:14:35,919 --> 01:14:40,659
comprehension where you will you will

1331
01:14:38,679 --> 01:14:42,699
see they are equivalent and if you did

1332
01:14:40,659 --> 01:15:05,949
it it they are they should give you the

1333
01:14:42,699 --> 01:15:09,518
same results so and what I'm going to do

1334
01:15:05,949 --> 01:15:11,879
is I'm going to version the the loop

1335
01:15:09,519 --> 01:15:11,879
first

1336
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:22,810
[Music]

1337
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:48,570
so now it didn't give me anything what's

1338
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:52,040
wrong with this thing I ran it it's

1339
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:52,040
right now it didn't give me anything

1340
01:15:54,440 --> 01:16:04,049
maybe what else very good in other words

1341
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:05,850
I aside a list and I told it what

1342
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:07,770
everything in the list but so I have to

1343
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:09,449
call the list to see what's in it the

1344
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:11,760
first one is it's a the list is empty

1345
01:16:09,449 --> 01:16:23,400
right well let's see now if the list is

1346
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:26,989
empty or not because if you have if you

1347
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:29,670
don't have the empty list defined then

1348
01:16:26,989 --> 01:16:32,360
the loop doesn't mirror to edit it

1349
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:36,270
because it doesn't know am i clear here

1350
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:39,509
all right now I will run the combination

1351
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:41,699
part and like I said these are somewhat

1352
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:44,969
very important tablet may be a little

1353
01:16:41,699 --> 01:17:00,949
bit advanced topics but to see if it

1354
01:16:44,969 --> 01:17:04,170
give us the same thing same thing and

1355
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:07,138
this is like I said there are a lots of

1356
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:09,119
the power of Python is not only in the

1357
01:17:07,139 --> 01:17:11,520
basic language but really there are

1358
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:14,460
topics a little bit more advanced topic

1359
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:18,090
that are very very powerful and they are

1360
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:21,030
made for you know a lots of data a lots

1361
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:22,949
of stuff so is that so far so good let's

1362
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:24,929
go to the next one

1363
01:17:22,949 --> 01:17:26,460
I think from now and they will be a

1364
01:17:24,929 --> 01:17:34,139
little bit interesting so this is

1365
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:38,489
basically a matrix and will get to have

1366
01:17:34,139 --> 01:17:40,679
more powerful useful way I have before

1367
01:17:38,489 --> 01:17:43,440
this guy now tell me to put this in the

1368
01:17:40,679 --> 01:17:47,010
middle I'll figure it myself

1369
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:49,348
so you can see a lot of typing but like

1370
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:50,969
I said if you just take a look if you

1371
01:17:49,349 --> 01:17:54,600
want

1372
01:17:50,969 --> 01:17:58,199
and I will just say guess what's what's

1373
01:17:54,600 --> 01:18:00,810
of each one of them can you agree in the

1374
01:17:58,199 --> 01:18:03,559
first one it's basically asking for a

1375
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:05,910
list of lists will that be fair enough

1376
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:10,800
that's what it is it just gives you a

1377
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:12,360
list of bunch of lists that's it and

1378
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,190
let's see what that equal and then we

1379
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:16,290
are interested in the little bit of

1380
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:21,480
indexing like I said I hope we will have

1381
01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:26,340
time to get to one of the like said the

1382
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:28,049
most important Python module we can't

1383
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:30,660
really say one they're more important

1384
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:32,940
than the other but those are they come

1385
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:35,250
are like a lots of depository now if you

1386
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:37,830
download Python from there they will

1387
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:44,310
download numpy and sci-fi and these are

1388
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:50,130
extremely powerful and useful so since

1389
01:18:44,310 --> 01:19:01,199
it's easier for me to to put this and I

1390
01:18:50,130 --> 01:19:08,690
will and basically it's a list of a

1391
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:13,049
three lists mixes here now if you go any

1392
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:16,110
try for example met matrix 1 1 or just

1393
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:19,170
one by itself just see what would you

1394
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:22,699
give you unfortunately you don't if you

1395
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:22,699
don't have the matrix you cannot do that

1396
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:48,660
so if I fact it's already given so it's

1397
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:50,330
always I think in my view when you type

1398
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:52,950
in especially and unfortunately

1399
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:56,850
something like this you do it in the fly

1400
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:59,040
and so you would guess it if it's a

1401
01:19:56,850 --> 01:20:01,740
matrix when it give me the first element

1402
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:04,230
of the matrix make sense here and since

1403
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:06,240
this is the matrix of three elements I'm

1404
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:08,370
telling it to give me the first element

1405
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:10,580
it just give me the first one make sense

1406
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:14,250
here and let's see if I'm right

1407
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:17,550
good before five and that was was it the

1408
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:18,900
first element now well then I don't know

1409
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:23,430
what I'm talking about that's what this

1410
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:25,700
guy's say it give us the second one

1411
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:26,970
because it starts from zero all right

1412
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:28,950
all right

1413
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:32,850
and you probably guessed it the second

1414
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:34,830
one it says give me the first element or

1415
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:38,310
not the first element maybe a little bit

1416
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:40,530
number one of the element number one of

1417
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:42,390
the matrix make sense now here in other

1418
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:44,910
words give me basically if you want the

1419
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:47,370
second element in the matrix

1420
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:49,580
the second element in the in there in

1421
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:52,620
the list of there of the second right

1422
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:55,530
kind of or maybe I'm confusing people in

1423
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:58,950
other words if the matrix here it's a 1

1424
01:20:55,530 --> 01:21:01,349
2 3 4 5 basically if you type matrix 1

1425
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:03,510
it should give you a 4 5 6

1426
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:06,230
why didn't likes it why didn't give you

1427
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:10,860
1 2 3 because you have to start at 0 and

1428
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:12,629
so the next one this one here where it's

1429
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:18,360
a fork then I'll just do this effect

1430
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:20,790
I'll do this this one here wash now I'm

1431
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:21,839
gonna not gonna hit enter but watch what

1432
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:25,040
it does it's it's very very

1433
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:28,050
straightforward it basically says ok I

1434
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:30,030
need the second element that really

1435
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:33,660
means the third element because we

1436
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:37,679
started zero right so give me the first

1437
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:39,300
element here the zero there the second

1438
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:42,150
the third element of the matrix

1439
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:44,880
make sense here and that and that's

1440
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:48,660
basically what what it does and if I do

1441
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:52,250
I believe it my computer believes me and

1442
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:52,250
it does what I asked it to do so

1443
01:21:55,650 --> 01:22:03,420
alright I'll do more I hope now is this

1444
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:06,190
is an interesting subject and maybe

1445
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:12,160
everybody these are long unfortunately

1446
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:14,739
you can write maybe some of them well I

1447
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:15,940
only have an example of numpy let's see

1448
01:22:14,739 --> 01:22:20,309
how much time do I have

1449
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:24,280
ooh I really didn't even cover

1450
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:28,000
dictionaries and those are I have one

1451
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:29,980
example of numpy if you look at

1452
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,340
dictionary are really the second most

1453
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:36,429
important object and by that I think

1454
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:38,310
troubles and sits are not you know

1455
01:22:36,430 --> 01:22:40,750
they're not because of their nature but

1456
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:42,580
dictionaries are very very important so

1457
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:46,150
I would ask if you have a few minutes at

1458
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:48,760
least do this do this and I promise

1459
01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:54,580
after this I said you have over five

1460
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:57,520
minutes if you just could just copy this

1461
01:22:54,580 --> 01:23:04,690
and and undone it and at least look at

1462
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:06,430
the structure just and you can see well

1463
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:07,900
anyway I don't know it's easy for me you

1464
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:11,710
can see you can see you maybe you can

1465
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:14,799
see so so basically what I want you just

1466
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:16,510
as this time some of them and say you

1467
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,790
know this is a dictionary why this is a

1468
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:21,400
dictionary because it has keys and

1469
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:23,620
variable in other words in list we don't

1470
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:27,309
have here is you have key you have eggs

1471
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:29,559
and spam and ham and then you have this

1472
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:30,910
is also listed dictionary in other

1473
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:34,000
weather you can have a list in a

1474
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:36,280
dictionary and all combination of the

1475
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,920
three of them am i clear and that is

1476
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:42,250
that's good depends on the problem but

1477
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:44,770
these are wise very flexible object for

1478
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:46,660
Python list and dictionary you can do so

1479
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:48,250
many things you can have dictionary

1480
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:52,330
lists and lists in dictionary and you

1481
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:54,250
you keep going until like so it they're

1482
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:59,739
very very useful and also mutable so you

1483
01:23:54,250 --> 01:24:01,360
can change all right I'm going to give

1484
01:23:59,739 --> 01:24:03,519
you a minute or two since this guy tells

1485
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:05,500
me I have a few more minutes but I'm

1486
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,880
going to show like one long thing about

1487
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:09,730
I

1488
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:11,980
have a lot more it looks like but maybe

1489
01:24:09,730 --> 01:24:15,280
a lot of time but I'll show you like the

1490
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:16,870
power of I can't really do justice to

1491
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:21,519
know me but I'll see you like as I told

1492
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:24,760
you by said has incredible set of

1493
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:28,330
modules but four of the most important

1494
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:30,550
module loses numerical percent they

1495
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:33,580
called short for numpy and then

1496
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:37,000
scientific python that short for or Sai

1497
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:39,250
PI and then you have pandas that if you

1498
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:41,070
have a loss of tabular data then there

1499
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:43,420
is a really good thing if some of you

1500
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:45,250
dealing with tabular data and then you

1501
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:48,700
have met bla clip which is basically a

1502
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:52,690
charting utility all Python comes with

1503
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:54,250
these and so if you if you type these

1504
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:56,710
things or at least you hopefully you'll

1505
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:59,830
have an idea and you have even the

1506
01:24:56,710 --> 01:25:03,640
answers there so if you look at you have

1507
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:08,019
D it says it and D of ham you can see

1508
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:09,970
here the ham is basically you can change

1509
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:12,070
it so instead of ham is equal to 1 the

1510
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:13,870
second statement is say ham you can put

1511
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:17,259
a list in this place it am i clear here

1512
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:19,000
and so on and so forth so like few of

1513
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:20,410
you tablet I'm going to give you another

1514
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,630
minute please

1515
01:25:20,410 --> 01:25:28,240
and then I'll just do one thing in

1516
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:30,250
because Nami is really it just adjust

1517
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:40,349
the brim you know know me as I buy order

1518
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:45,040
the brain and and I will here shortly

1519
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:48,010
just use the enemy is an by n matrices

1520
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:51,450
or nummy bytes and matrices column

1521
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:54,760
arrays this is like a array is basically

1522
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:56,410
sit for anything arise like a vector you

1523
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:57,970
can have a vector and you can have two

1524
01:25:56,410 --> 01:25:59,650
dimensional vector in you have two three

1525
01:25:57,970 --> 01:26:02,710
dimensional vector and kind of also and

1526
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:04,509
that's alright so guys I'm going to give

1527
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:05,980
you one minute before this guy's going

1528
01:26:04,510 --> 01:26:09,190
to shut everything here and me and tell

1529
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:12,549
me to stops yeah cut it off but let me

1530
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:14,410
give me and then I will show and and

1531
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:16,600
here is what I'll do guys is maybe one

1532
01:26:14,410 --> 01:26:18,940
or two I promise I will I'll send you

1533
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,840
this in your email or something if you

1534
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:21,790
care you can you

1535
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:23,889
look at if I can even give you the whole

1536
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:26,260
thing if you care let me go through

1537
01:26:23,889 --> 01:26:29,770
since I don't have time good to number

1538
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:34,840
ten here it's the last one here and here

1539
01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:37,330
is basically what I do is I have to if

1540
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:39,340
Nami is not loaded because these are

1541
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:41,199
huge and so what you want really you

1542
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:46,989
want to load only what you need so I

1543
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:49,419
have to say important numpy is NP so now

1544
01:26:46,989 --> 01:26:52,209
it takes some time and it flows now I

1545
01:26:49,420 --> 01:27:00,849
can use all the power of numerical

1546
01:26:52,210 --> 01:27:08,190
Python and if I just say this let's see

1547
01:27:00,849 --> 01:27:08,190
if no this is not going to do it

1548
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:30,490
say the revenue rose you guys have to

1549
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:34,200
figure what the error is I'm not getting

1550
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:34,200
any help here so after idea

1551
01:27:57,420 --> 01:28:06,620
what's going on here tell you what's

1552
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:06,620
going on here here is what I didn't do

1553
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:19,969
maybe not okay now it doesn't follow you

1554
01:28:14,730 --> 01:28:26,459
have to uh let's see now that should do

1555
01:28:19,969 --> 01:28:30,590
no it doesn't like this see yeah I'm

1556
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:39,660
gonna try it one more time to see this

1557
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:42,150
and a infeed see if that doesn't ha so

1558
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:45,120
basically what I did is I forgot to type

1559
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:49,920
the NP that then the the numerical

1560
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:51,960
Python and now watch what I do now it

1561
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:55,170
gives me a matrix that I know am i clear

1562
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:58,380
here and now I'll do the last thing so

1563
01:28:55,170 --> 01:29:03,650
now it just like the numerical Python

1564
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:10,440
becomes like a method so if I would say

1565
01:29:03,650 --> 01:29:12,719
the NP diagonal and say a a you just

1566
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:14,879
what it will give me write it this is

1567
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:16,650
something I don't know how many of you

1568
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:19,860
know a little bit of matrices these are

1569
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:23,969
basically it gives you diagonal rows so

1570
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:26,160
if I do that it would give you the arrow

1571
01:29:23,969 --> 01:29:29,880
of the matrix and maybe I should pipe a

1572
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:33,120
yes there if you see a is here so it

1573
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:35,820
goes 0 6 12 would go 1 7 13 at good

1574
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:37,890
agony right clear here and that note

1575
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:39,480
thank you guys for listening I'll be

1576
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:42,570
more than happy like said if you have

1577
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:45,718
any questions anything that I can answer

1578
01:29:42,570 --> 01:29:47,400
and like I said we if we can't answer it

1579
01:29:45,719 --> 01:29:49,050
now if you need any help that we can

1580
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:51,480
provide and we'll be more than happy to

1581
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:53,730
and if you have any questions if I can't

1582
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:55,500
answer them now we just leave me an

1583
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:58,049
email or phone number and I'll do my

1584
01:29:55,500 --> 01:30:02,679
best and see what I can do thank you

1585
01:29:58,050 --> 01:30:05,829
very much thank you

1586
01:30:02,679 --> 01:30:05,829
thank you

1587
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:13,670
you
