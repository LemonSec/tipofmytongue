1
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:17,689
all right everybody thank you for

2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,369
attending and and welcome to my

3
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:23,360
presentation about building an

4
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:27,890
application security program so my name

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,150
is Larry Cox I am from Pittsburgh and

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,360
I've been working in application

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:35,690
security for many years since the field

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,300
really was created and I've seen a lot

9
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:41,120
of changes a lot of you know a lot of

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,339
blood evolution in the field I've worked

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,919
a lot with very large companies

12
00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:47,930
deploying you know testing tools and

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,460
initially that kind of became into a

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:56,330
knapsack type of field in itself okay

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:01:00,379
and so most recently I was working at

16
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:02,269
digital and working with the the BCM

17
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:04,878
community in their building security and

18
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:07,310
maturity model and we were acquired by a

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,229
company called synopsis so that's I'm

20
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,000
just using our logo slides here I'm not

21
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:12,380
really representing anything products or

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,829
anything like that from our company but

23
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:21,979
so if you see that come up that's why

24
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:23,570
okay so I have like said observed what

25
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:27,259
people have been doing in application

26
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,329
security in many large firms as well as

27
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:32,840
small firms fanning of many different

28
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:35,240
domains from financials to insurance to

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:39,380
embedded systems to just solve for

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,850
companies in itself and what we're

31
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,350
really fine is that there's really no

32
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,839
snowflake there's nothing that's like

33
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,309
special and how it is a lot of

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,920
commonality and what all these companies

35
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,179
do and so what I'm going to do kind of

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,079
keep a real high-level today I know

37
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:52,670
you've probably been to a lot of

38
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:54,048
technical talks and it's gonna be like

39
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,140
bigger picture type of things

40
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:59,749
organizational things that you can take

41
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,399
back and maybe apply to your jobs if

42
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:03,679
you're being asked to start up an

43
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,030
application security program and that's

44
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:12,220
basically what we're going to be

45
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:14,480
covering today so just an analogy here

46
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,910
everything now it what no matter what

47
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,548
business you're in it's a software

48
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,560
business we used to say I mean ten years

49
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:24,230
ago I always always lead with family

50
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,530
software is a strategic weapon and you

51
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,630
know

52
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,040
looking at it that way but now really

53
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,750
what we've seen is it like in the

54
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,910
automotive industry is a good analogy

55
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,880
and witness the same situation today a

56
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:38,350
very disruptive and transformational era

57
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:43,220
of computing you know when Henry Ford

58
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:45,230
rolled out the Model T car it wasn't it

59
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:48,410
was 30 years after about the same amount

60
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,700
of time since since mosaic first came

61
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,760
made you know the internet generally

62
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,470
available to everybody that it wasn't

63
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,030
wasn't new cars weren't new but what

64
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:58,340
made it and when you was that the fact

65
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:01,459
that you know you it was mass-produced

66
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:04,010
and created like 15,000 orders right

67
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:06,080
away so similarly we're seeing a similar

68
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,239
type of transformations like for example

69
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,470
in the automotive industry where you

70
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,390
know you've got cars that are getting

71
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,910
they're getting 40 software your

72
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,768
releases a year right and you know

73
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:20,060
that's what so we're seeing it that kind

74
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:25,100
of thing happening now so application

75
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:28,420
security is going to be increasingly a

76
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:31,220
focus in companies you know traditional

77
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,988
defenses are gone away things are moving

78
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,609
to the cloud things you know controls

79
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:36,829
that you had in place one day or blown

80
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,720
apart and not there anymore and you know

81
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:40,239
and you know we're a lot of times we're

82
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,560
finding ourselves you know kind of

83
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,590
reverting back to bad habits in those

84
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,090
cases right so I kind of want to point

85
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,690
some things out in spite of all the

86
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:53,000
changes that are gone on agile

87
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,980
development processes see ICD things of

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,930
that nature of really very you know some

89
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,179
companies releasing multiple times a day

90
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,370
you know things like that

91
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:04,370
these things still stand true these you

92
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:06,170
know these tenants of software

93
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,000
development you know could you could

94
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,640
apply it to any non-functional feature

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,959
of software you know that securities and

96
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,238
emergent properties it's like you don't

97
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,859
just bulk on performance at the end of

98
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,450
an application right you have to kind of

99
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:19,940
think it through and there's a lot of

100
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:23,510
aspects to it right the other thing is

101
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:26,719
that we tend to focus on the coding

102
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,760
vulnerabilities and AB sec we really

103
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,919
need to start increasingly our focus on

104
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,630
getting the designs right upfront for

105
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:35,000
picking secure frameworks and things of

106
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,979
that nature so don't forget bad designs

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,330
account for 50 percent of the flaws that

108
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:41,900
we see out there right

109
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,940
and announced isis data that's just a

110
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,460
facts right and those are the most

111
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,319
expensive wants to fix so your apps that

112
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,080
cognition is me are going to need to get

113
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:54,500
involved with application security

114
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:57,590
upfront and and get it into a very fluid

115
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,000
and frictionless environment because no

116
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,888
matter how much you test was what i

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,990
always say you can't test yourself to

118
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:05,659
secure software no matter it so it's

119
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:08,840
really a you're going to have to really

120
00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:11,569
become developers hats on you learn and

121
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,489
think like a developer's work with them

122
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:14,840
and create these more frictionless

123
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,080
integrations with the application

124
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:22,068
security inside of there SDL sees

125
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,800
whatever processes are using how many of

126
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:28,580
the people in this room here have teams

127
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,620
that develop software ok quite a few of

128
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,330
yeah alright because it also applies to

129
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,949
vendor management and other things as

130
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:36,289
well there's still traditional things

131
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:37,370
that we see as well a little cut a

132
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:40,009
little touch on that a little bit later

133
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,139
on so what i want to talk today is like

134
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:44,029
how do you get started you know how do

135
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:46,490
you convince somebody to start investing

136
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:48,139
in an application security so that's the

137
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,029
first turtle that we have to overcome

138
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,380
sometimes it's you know you've been

139
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:53,029
asked to do this but you're not getting

140
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,150
adequate funding so you got to find a

141
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:57,949
strategy to go about that then i want to

142
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,960
spend most of the time talking about how

143
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:03,159
do we shift the culture and you know get

144
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:08,330
in make that seamless integration with

145
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:09,560
you know software development and then

146
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,300
how do we just you know where did where

147
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,289
is our first steps what should we do to

148
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:20,090
get you know kick start our process

149
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:23,270
alright okay so there's a couple

150
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:29,000
animation alright so whenever you look

151
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:31,580
at the the type of controls that you

152
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,069
have and inside of application security

153
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,529
you can you can typically have things

154
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:38,690
that occur today and you'll typically

155
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,879
have things that occur late after it's

156
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,909
been pushed into production such as pin

157
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,740
test right then you'll have things that

158
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:49,759
occur a little bit earlier like for

159
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:52,249
example a source code analysis inside

160
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,929
the build process we're testing in QA

161
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:56,479
things of that nature and then you have

162
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:57,739
preventive measures and those are the

163
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,899
ones that we were talking about where

164
00:06:57,739 --> 00:07:02,119
you like work with them to devote you

165
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:03,529
know secure libraries you know open

166
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:05,089
source making sure the open source

167
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:06,589
that's brought in and secure things of

168
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:08,539
that nature they're more preventative in

169
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:10,609
nature as well as especially training

170
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:13,878
and things of that nature so the way you

171
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:16,448
can think about this this these tenants

172
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:18,829
have been around since I first started

173
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:22,069
it's you know software engineering at

174
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:24,889
Georgia Tech in the 80s and basically

175
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:28,099
there's the 110 100 rule where things

176
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:30,499
are at 110 100 1000 10000 he goes on

177
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:32,019
things are more expensive to fix

178
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:33,829
once it's been put into production

179
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:36,469
particularly if it's like an embedded

180
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:37,879
device in this you know you like they

181
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:39,379
have to come out and do a maintenance on

182
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,479
it for it's like a meter for example

183
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:43,429
like a guy had to come out and replace a

184
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:45,229
meter for now they can patch them up

185
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:48,469
remotely but those things are very

186
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:51,079
expensive to fix right so what we're

187
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:54,049
seeing today there's a shift in this

188
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:55,969
decisis of thinking away from just

189
00:07:54,049 --> 00:07:57,709
thinking about risks like it used to be

190
00:07:55,969 --> 00:08:01,039
like about what's our risk disposition

191
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:04,849
and but because of these of a lot of

192
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,949
these these digital transformation

193
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:09,049
initiatives and rapid delivery of

194
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:11,539
applications you're seeing this the

195
00:08:09,049 --> 00:08:13,489
sizes starting to like be you know the

196
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:16,188
cultures of the companies are becoming a

197
00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:17,808
little more risk accepting alright it's

198
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:19,610
saying like well you know we have to

199
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:22,159
move fast because Amazon's me you know

200
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,689
doing this and our customers expect us

201
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:26,869
to do the same thing you know that

202
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:28,999
Amazon is doing right you know that's

203
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:31,879
that that's becoming an expectation so

204
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:34,459
what happens is you know risk becomes a

205
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:37,250
little more you know acceptable a lot of

206
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:38,750
these organization less so and financial

207
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,279
services could you still have a lot of

208
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,599
federal government's and you know

209
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:45,139
regulations and things of that nature

210
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:48,589
and around that but in others maybe not

211
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:51,649
so much so what we're seeing is that in

212
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:53,959
order to to justify the investment in

213
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:56,480
these things is that we know that we do

214
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:58,369
want to get them fixed right so we have

215
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,540
to look at it from a software economics

216
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:04,819
perspective right and basically

217
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,199
investing more aggressive early in the

218
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:08,240
early SDLC were

219
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,950
right it's really a balance you're still

220
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,170
gonna do your PIN test but you also need

221
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,810
to do things earlier in the process and

222
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:16,250
basically well we know we know this

223
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,899
because we interview a lot of sites

224
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,820
those and my job we talk to a lot of

225
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:22,190
people that's part of these building

226
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,709
security in maturity model B sim studies

227
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,300
right and so we've collected this

228
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:27,979
information and this is a trend that is

229
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,469
occurring it says something that we

230
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:34,639
actually observe across you know many

231
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:37,010
companies and so so one of the things

232
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,899
you can start saying like okay we're pin

233
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,250
test so you start in your program you're

234
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:41,720
saying we're doing all this pin testing

235
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,250
and we're finding these vote lists of

236
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,660
you know high and critical

237
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,370
vulnerabilities mediums and whatever

238
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,560
that you find as a result of a pin test

239
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:51,620
and then you throw it back over the wall

240
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,300
to the development team and you know

241
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,769
they get around the fixing them right

242
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,510
something in the worst case scenario but

243
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:59,990
if you may have a policy in place that

244
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:01,699
requires them to fix them right away but

245
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,320
meanwhile you've got to either roll back

246
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:05,599
changes in production and things I think

247
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,459
makes it much more expensive so what we

248
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,899
want to do is start engaging with the

249
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:11,510
development teams earlier in the process

250
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:15,290
so they get it right to begin with and

251
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:18,350
that is a some real data around here

252
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,880
actually avert it's there's a I'm gonna

253
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:24,019
have to email these slides I think for

254
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:28,939
you as well there's a but what car

255
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:31,310
makers can teach enterprises this is a

256
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:35,750
real study from a very large insurance

257
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:37,969
company and that whom we work with and

258
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:40,610
this is the real data that they contain

259
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,880
they've tracked is that cost of

260
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,750
defectives call them defects with their

261
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,240
differentiate between a vulnerability

262
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:50,240
and a defect in different phases

263
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,829
development for a real company so once

264
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,870
it was in this this you notice the

265
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:55,640
phases here kind of tailored maintain

266
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:59,120
that smells that's their their terms of

267
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:01,699
production it's in 14 is 14 thousand but

268
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,949
if we were to be able to codify those

269
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:05,329
things in terms of requirements so that

270
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:09,229
when the developers know what to code

271
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:11,000
within the beginning right it 139 but

272
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,319
before they just fix it in they're happy

273
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,399
to eat okay

274
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:15,769
and there are tools we'll talk about

275
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,240
tools that allow you to do that so what

276
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:20,120
that translated was that their legacy

277
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,529
program the way they were doing it

278
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,720
to fix things the way they had been

279
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:26,240
going down the traditional path gautam

280
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,370
in a twenty million dollar you know

281
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,580
difference it compared a way they're

282
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:34,339
doing it today alright so there's a

283
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:37,010
there's roughly a twenty-one million

284
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:38,990
dollar cost savings of implementing this

285
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,670
program that's a very big company right

286
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:44,720
so but that's a lot of money

287
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:47,300
you know but it's so that goes a long

288
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,860
ways it communicates very effectively to

289
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,779
HUD's a board level and people of that

290
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,980
nature that kept they they get this you

291
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:53,240
know doing things right up the first

292
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,450
time as a lot makes a lot more sense

293
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,250
than you know you know putting the

294
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,690
electric electrical wiring in after you

295
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,740
put the drywall in your house for

296
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:06,560
example you know you don't want to do

297
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:08,540
that so that'll though that's one tip

298
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,849
for it that's a so that's us you can

299
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,760
take those numbers and you can look at

300
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:15,470
them and use your own thinking about how

301
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,020
you want to do this look at your average

302
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,010
loaded costs per developer or protests

303
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,360
or things like that

304
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:24,200
and you can come up with your own

305
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,270
metrics it is possible to do that but to

306
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,089
do it you need to at least have started

307
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:32,569
with doing some testing that's

308
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:34,310
post-production like pin testing all

309
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:38,810
right we have the culture basically have

310
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:43,969
two two levers you can play with when

311
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:47,209
you're dealing with a culture one is is

312
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:50,480
around enablement getting people

313
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:52,250
equipped to to do the right thing their

314
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,709
code properly so that's that's gonna

315
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,600
involve investing in the people getting

316
00:12:54,709 --> 00:13:00,469
people Brooke some good tooling that

317
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,850
allows them to you know code in a way

318
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,580
that they can prevent defects from

319
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:07,450
occurring in the first place right and

320
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:11,390
also integrating smoothly with the SDLC

321
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:12,830
early in the process right so that will

322
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,560
table all get talked about that in some

323
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:18,380
detail bit later the other ways you

324
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,239
reduce the friction okay so you don't

325
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:23,089
want you know development teams to

326
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,220
continue to think about like security

327
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:27,230
it's those people you know you know it's

328
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,209
week yeah we're a team you know dev SEC

329
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:32,300
ops you know that that's the cult change

330
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:33,800
in culture there right if I'm sure

331
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,649
you've heard of that so

332
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,689
gonna go into that too much but but

333
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,130
basically you need to have a way and

334
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,110
we're talking about a way of getting

335
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:46,070
that some security expertise embedded

336
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:47,350
into the teams okay and improve it with

337
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,820
by doing so you improve the

338
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,370
collaboration amongst the the you know

339
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,930
Devon's second hops team in ops is

340
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:57,019
becoming a bigger and bigger thing as we

341
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:59,329
move to cloud as well because as we have

342
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:00,920
moved to cloud and as particularly as

343
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:03,170
we're moving to platform as a service

344
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,209
and infrastructure as a code you're

345
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,769
finding that a lot of the things that

346
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:08,329
were traditionally responsible of an

347
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:10,700
infrastructure team are really shifting

348
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:13,790
more to the app set team about like what

349
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,680
are the you know policies around virtual

350
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,380
firewalls and things of that nature that

351
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,800
typically are you know pretty messed up

352
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:24,740
if you if you start looking at a really

353
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,019
initiate Avant at and so you're all son

354
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:30,019
becomes a responsibility of of the app

355
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:34,240
set team so ops is going to be a more

356
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:40,430
and more important area to focus in on

357
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:42,529
that's the wrong way all right so here's

358
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:47,779
an example of what I mean by investing

359
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:50,329
in people so you need to have role-based

360
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:53,720
of a role based training and this is an

361
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:57,010
example of some role based training

362
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:59,240
curriculum but basically you have

363
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,459
different roles for mobile developers

364
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,770
your QA people your architect whatever

365
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:05,569
however you decide to split the roles up

366
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,520
but it has to be very specific to the

367
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,370
roles there's probably some foundational

368
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,079
classes that everybody takes but then as

369
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,700
they get into a little more intermediate

370
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,250
advanced classes or like language

371
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,380
specific you don't want you know like

372
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,120
there'll be about Java versus PHP or

373
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:24,230
whatever languages you might be dealing

374
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:26,540
with right mobile of course right things

375
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,760
of that nature so you can you basically

376
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,860
have you want to create a role based

377
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,269
curriculum and you want to roll it out

378
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,920
in a way that's like here's the

379
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:35,390
foundational things here's the

380
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,849
intermediate things that we want people

381
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:40,089
to do and then as you progress maybe a

382
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:45,920
year later you start layering in some

383
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:47,600
advanced activities right so so when I

384
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,519
say roll base trainees would take

385
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,880
here's like it's very the rolls were

386
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,680
very granular right and and also there's

387
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,810
some tearing to the training there's a

388
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,790
lot of companies that provide this now

389
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,189
and ideally what you want this to be

390
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,779
kind of likes bite-sized training as

391
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,730
well right

392
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:06,170
and I'll talk about a little bit also

393
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,630
all the training can also be integrated

394
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:10,219
inside the integrated devote whatever

395
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,620
IDE they might be using a lot of times

396
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,480
there's like like you you have a

397
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,699
vulnerability that's been found and they

398
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,949
can click on that and it'll spin up a

399
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:22,339
little training a one-minute training

400
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:24,560
module on how to prevent you know sequel

401
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:29,569
injection which unfortunately is still

402
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:35,300
very prevalent ten years after we

403
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:37,339
started tracking it all right so the

404
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,930
other one is how do you get so you got

405
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:41,569
the training so we know training alone

406
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,638
you know it's good but a lot of times it

407
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:45,560
doesn't stick real well people revert

408
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:47,389
back that bad habits if there's nothing

409
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,189
around it so you got to embed yourself

410
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:50,839
primeira so you got to make reduce that

411
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:55,399
friction by getting embedded inside of

412
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:58,160
the development process so what we all

413
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:01,639
the all the firms that we refer to in

414
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,079
the BCM currently a hundred and twenty

415
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:07,640
different firms in to study right now

416
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:12,079
all of them have a a knapsack team and

417
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:13,970
most of them have a good many of them

418
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,119
have what's called a satellite program

419
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,650
or a community of excellence it's

420
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,958
something like that it's a it's a well

421
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,549
run structured program because there's

422
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,169
you're fine gonna be like a couple of

423
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:26,270
you in a knapsack team or maybe five or

424
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:28,339
six you know it's not a lot then you got

425
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:33,110
it how do you scale that right so what

426
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:35,299
you do is you begin recruiting people

427
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:38,120
that are in the development teams that

428
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:40,370
have an it natural interest for for

429
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,649
security so you can you can screen them

430
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,360
there you can like use secure code

431
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,490
warrior or things like that I've used in

432
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,709
the past to kind of figure out who is

433
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,929
you know who's gonna be the bin reached

434
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,880
your benchmark that you need someone

435
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:55,190
that you can do this so that's typically

436
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,210
one of the better developers it's not

437
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,950
gonna you know you don't want someone

438
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:01,399
that's like you know real green doing

439
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:04,500
this it's got to be someone that has

440
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:06,629
that someone that has some credibility

441
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,340
you know with the other developers right

442
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,039
so someone a little more senior all

443
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,649
right that is interested in doing a

444
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:15,809
security development as well and so once

445
00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:18,000
you once you recruit them then what you

446
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:20,129
can do is you organize a champions

447
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,409
program or a satellite there's and

448
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,789
sometimes that people call mavens if

449
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:25,260
there's a lot of different terms that

450
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:27,990
they have with this but it's the whole

451
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:33,090
the same idea so it's basically a team

452
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:35,940
of people that are centrally run by a

453
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:38,639
knapsack team but distributed into the

454
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,289
into the development they're part that

455
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,640
there are typically developers they're

456
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:43,590
part of the development team they could

457
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,380
be QA people that could be architects a

458
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:48,090
different role thing get me wrong there

459
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:52,470
okay and then what you'll do is you'll

460
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:54,990
want to structure your program because

461
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,570
you can't do everything all at once

462
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:59,340
you'll still create some sort of banding

463
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,870
for people at first you may not have any

464
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,629
because it'll be a little more informal

465
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:05,250
but as you as it starts getting traction

466
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,470
you'll running to say like I need

467
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,480
someone that's gonna use belts you can

468
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,880
use metals brought you know different

469
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,820
ideas like you know bronze metal silver

470
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,159
metal gold metal you know this company

471
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,960
here this example here uses belting for

472
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:20,159
example you know that's that's actually

473
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,720
kind of tab doing a lot of companies

474
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,340
because it's the Six Sigma thing you

475
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,320
know so a lot of people aren't into that

476
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,959
so you can use whatever words you know

477
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,889
you want but the principle is is that

478
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,059
you start them off and you say okay

479
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:36,110
we've purchased some static analysis

480
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:40,830
tool well let's get them knowing how to

481
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:42,570
run the tool you know do some triage on

482
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,908
the results and things like that it's

483
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:47,189
just real basic stuff right just get

484
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:48,510
them going with that and in what we're

485
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,200
doing is we're asking them to spend

486
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:53,640
maybe you know a couple hours a week

487
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,950
initially on this type of work right as

488
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,630
they move up into like the green belt

489
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,820
here now we're to ask him to do a little

490
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:02,190
bit more we're gonna start asking them

491
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,049
to do maybe we want you to do a little

492
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,330
bit of design review and threat modeling

493
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:10,860
right that that we might be doing it in

494
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:14,370
the app set team so a threat model is is

495
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:16,229
a very good way of understanding

496
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,360
the security requirements are for a new

497
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,130
application or an existing application

498
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,809
to be in the case of an existing one

499
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,600
it's a very good way of understanding

500
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:26,910
where there might be some potentially

501
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,120
serious design flaws and identifying and

502
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:32,160
resolving those so you should always do

503
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,459
threat modeling on the apps on your your

504
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,800
most critical applications right you

505
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,510
ideally want to do it on all of them you

506
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,280
know of course but you know look at but

507
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:44,910
they will talk about risk ranking the

508
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,220
portfolio in a second here but as we

509
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,380
move up into the brown belts then you

510
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,360
know what we'll do is maybe we'll add

511
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,309
some other thing capabilities for maybe

512
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,490
you've you've purchased some other tools

513
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:57,928
or you want them to write custom rules

514
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,760
things there's a lot of there's plenty

515
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:02,309
of work to do there's earn more in more

516
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:06,030
advanced areas of testing and things

517
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:07,710
like that that they can do and in this

518
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:10,139
case and they had a black belt which

519
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,360
would actually be people that get you

520
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:15,660
serve on various boards and you know

521
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:18,260
create reusable IP in burp suite things

522
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:25,920
of that nature or you know for example

523
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:27,800
alright so you have a so the takeaway on

524
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,120
the champions is if you you know they're

525
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,550
developers or people embedded in the

526
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,550
teams you need to set expectations that

527
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:37,590
they're gonna need certain amount of

528
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,240
time dedicated towards being advocates

529
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:42,449
of application security of Monster to

530
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,250
developers right so whatever time that

531
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,140
is sometimes it can be as little as like

532
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,309
a couple hours a week some companies

533
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,740
have actually said we're going to

534
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:51,629
actually you know make them almost

535
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,160
full-time you know because they have

536
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:56,610
really big development they cover a big

537
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,620
development team right I prefer to have

538
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,570
them actually be developers that and

539
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,428
spend maybe eight hours a week around

540
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,860
applications security topics like

541
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:06,720
helping developers fix you know things

542
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,729
that the tool found or you know

543
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,770
explaining things that's why it's not a

544
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,300
false positive that they need to fix it

545
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,730
it's been doing that type of discussion

546
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:17,820
but still be engaged with development

547
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:19,770
because they're got more skin in the

548
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,689
game then you know they're not if you

549
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,490
you got someone a full time also that

550
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,380
you're kind of right back to where you

551
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:27,450
started we're like oh is that guy you

552
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,990
know he's not really contributing code

553
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,290
to the

554
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:35,220
bass right so that's my personal

555
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:38,159
preference you know I've seen it done

556
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:40,260
both ways I feel this more effective

557
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,990
though and as it being part of the

558
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:47,010
development team and then you can tear

559
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:49,830
it it's not I think a lot of us focused

560
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:51,920
on on training here like this is

561
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,540
training that we identify form but

562
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,160
you're gonna have activities so you

563
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,309
should you should best they basically

564
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:03,030
define roles and activities for all the

565
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:04,379
champions typically do that like in a

566
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:09,928
charter document or something along

567
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:14,220
those lines so how did we the way that

568
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:19,170
we have become getting applications

569
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:21,300
security embedded inside the SDL C's is

570
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:24,690
you know I've often referred to in the

571
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:27,690
past as tool directed governance ok now

572
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:30,690
I've heard latest term is software to

573
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:34,230
find a software-defined governance

574
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:36,059
lifecycle ok so basically what we're

575
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,679
doing here is we're taking your policies

576
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:40,020
and things of that nature and we're and

577
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,230
we're implementing it inside a tool

578
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:45,690
chain okay so this is a kind of a pretty

579
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:48,330
a little more advanced way of doing

580
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,650
things it's something that you'll grow

581
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,840
into so I'm going to kind of go through

582
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:54,780
it step by step and you'll end up doing

583
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,399
here you're gonna have to pick like

584
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,690
where do you want to start and we'll

585
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,580
talk about that a little bit but so

586
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:05,820
typically if you start in an agile

587
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:09,120
process you have your backlog so it's

588
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:11,100
important to have policies and also a

589
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,809
threat model that can help feed that

590
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:17,730
backlog okay and the product backlogs

591
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:19,200
should contain their stories but it also

592
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:21,840
should contain non-functional

593
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,950
requirements in fr-s all right so what

594
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,959
you want to do is translate your

595
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,550
policies and coding standards and things

596
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,040
that you want people to do into

597
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:30,870
non-functional requirements right this

598
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,790
is the single biggest thing you can do

599
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,020
because now the developers know what

600
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:36,510
they have to write from the very

601
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,500
beginning right so you know they're not

602
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,970
gonna beginning at the end of the

603
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,590
project and saying like well you should

604
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:44,009
I didn't know

605
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:45,959
we were supposed to use you know six

606
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:47,730
inches you know a foot of encryption

607
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,590
instead of one inch of encryption or

608
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:53,909
something like that right yeah so

609
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:56,009
they'll know all that stuff up front so

610
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:58,799
what you're once they're working inside

611
00:24:56,009 --> 00:25:02,519
the ID you should one of the there's a

612
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,860
lot of the tools now have ability to do

613
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:06,570
some lightweight static analysis inside

614
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,039
the IDE so it's almost like a spell

615
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,990
checker you know taps you on the

616
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:13,580
shoulder says you know don't do that you

617
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:16,499
know you know you know developers and

618
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:19,139
include myself in this group as a we

619
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:21,059
hate seeing uh we a seen a little red

620
00:25:19,139 --> 00:25:22,889
checkmark in that in the IDs now it's

621
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:25,980
something appear yellow we've got to fix

622
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:28,199
it you know this like CD thing so that's

623
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,730
really good and then the training

624
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,110
mentioned that all the training we do

625
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,090
but you can also have that just-in-time

626
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:34,619
training like this saying okay you know

627
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:36,149
it's cross-site scripting us or how do I

628
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:38,369
fix this you know I'll do it how to do

629
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:41,309
input sanitization for example what's a

630
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:43,139
good thing so those are you know the

631
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:45,809
type of things that you can you can put

632
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:48,869
in there so a very valuable very good

633
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:52,168
place to start right here is training

634
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:54,449
and getting it in the IDE all right so

635
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:55,830
the next thing you'll do is the

636
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:59,190
developer is gonna want to commit their

637
00:25:55,830 --> 00:26:01,080
code okay so now it gets into a little

638
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:04,889
more complicated static analysis tool

639
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:07,860
Semitic so anybody here uses a static

640
00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:10,439
analysis tool in a build process anybody

641
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:13,229
a few of you okay

642
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,999
all right yeah so there's there's you

643
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:17,549
know there's lots of tools out there

644
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:19,230
there's open source tools that are there

645
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:22,830
but they tend to generate a lot of noise

646
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:25,320
and you know they're they're they don't

647
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:27,059
you know they're pretty expensive but so

648
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,710
when you do deploy them you got you know

649
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:31,918
you want to really make the best of them

650
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:35,879
right so one of the things we're seeing

651
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:38,850
people do is the you know initially you

652
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:40,709
know several years ago the static

653
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:43,199
analysis tool to run by a static

654
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:45,570
analysis tool team and every now and

655
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,909
then you'd get a you'd get the code and

656
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:49,408
you run the static analysis on it and

657
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:51,149
you give the results back to the

658
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:53,070
developers a little bit like the pen

659
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:54,449
testing then town you know all right

660
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,770
what we're trying to do now is we

661
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,630
trying to get that like right in the

662
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:00,000
right is simple before they commit their

663
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:02,550
code we can do an incremental scan on

664
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,920
the code right and prevent them from

665
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:06,870
committing the code so it breaks it at

666
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,940
that point you can't commit it back into

667
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:11,459
the main line because you've got a

668
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,810
little more a look you know a little

669
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,200
deeper scan than what you would get an

670
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,330
ID

671
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,970
in other words but still this has this

672
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:19,169
has the scan has to complete like in

673
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:21,450
1015 seconds right it's not something

674
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:23,760
that can take you know like a static

675
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:28,110
analysis scan can take 24 hours or so de

676
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:30,990
to fully run across the whole codebase

677
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:34,260
alright so other things they can look at

678
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:36,720
is at this point is when there is when

679
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:38,460
they're doing some unit testing so

680
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,420
there's some tools to cut every anybody

681
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:43,350
familiar with I asked terminology

682
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:45,900
interactive application security testing

683
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:49,050
so it's a new new technology there's a

684
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:52,830
couple of basically two companies that

685
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:54,030
are the leaders and that but it's a very

686
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:59,399
effective tool because it kind of

687
00:27:54,030 --> 00:28:01,470
combines the the outside end of a black

688
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,680
box texts over like a you know like a

689
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:07,260
gas dynamics can with the inside out of

690
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,820
a static skin right so what happens is

691
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,940
that and some of them you get very

692
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:14,520
little false positives as a result we're

693
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,380
very very good results out of this so it

694
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,110
eliminates the friction around triage

695
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,420
right so you can run some of that in

696
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:23,639
this typically it's running at once it's

697
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:26,190
in the bill fully built app great but I

698
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,830
like to bet some clients it's starting

699
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:31,940
to do it here if it passes that piece

700
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:35,909
then you're going into the build process

701
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:37,710
okay so and when you're doing a bill now

702
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:41,970
you've got you've got a working

703
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:45,240
application you can you can do some some

704
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:47,430
risk based testing based on you know

705
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,890
what your non-functional requirements

706
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:52,020
are and looking at those right you can

707
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:54,260
do static analysis you can do software

708
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:57,540
composition analysis here which is the

709
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,430
looking at the open source and the the

710
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:02,280
feeds of open source in here and see if

711
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:05,520
they're using both bar either viral

712
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:08,310
licenses for example really bad in some

713
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,870
cases and but also vulnerable

714
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:12,210
you know well known vulnerabilities and

715
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:14,129
old certain open-source libraries right

716
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:16,710
you don't want to introduce that as well

717
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:20,340
so the composition analysis that can

718
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:25,890
occur at this point and what we'll see

719
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:27,330
is we move on to testing alright and

720
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,460
this is typically where you see the is

721
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:31,320
come in who's in the is in the test

722
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,760
phase but you can't put it in earlier if

723
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:37,379
you're you're willing to run it on the

724
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:41,550
developers desktops and this is where

725
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:44,400
you have your dynamic scans but so these

726
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:47,159
scans can take like overnight to run or

727
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:51,750
in so sometimes they don't if you're

728
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:54,450
running in a continuous delivery type of

729
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:57,780
mode very few companies are doing this

730
00:29:54,450 --> 00:30:00,390
today right but people want to do it it

731
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:02,190
may take too long to run okay so there's

732
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:03,900
strategies around that where you have to

733
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:05,400
that's where I'm saying companies are

734
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,560
willing to accept the risk they actually

735
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,030
go ahead and deploy but then you have to

736
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,679
have a whole architecture around

737
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:12,780
micro-services and things like that that

738
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,490
we're talking about netflix and

739
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:18,629
companies like that that do this type of

740
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:20,190
stuff so but you know that's that's

741
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,540
where the bar is and you know that's why

742
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,070
we will be in a few years right

743
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,080
everybody's going to be doing the same

744
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:27,120
type of you know doing the same type of

745
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:33,120
work in a few years so just you know let

746
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:34,409
me know ahead of time so you know you

747
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,389
can do some pin testing and things that

748
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:40,320
they've nature and then you eventually

749
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:42,870
get back into the deployment so here's

750
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,590
an area where it's emerging now is where

751
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:48,659
you're wanting to look at the deployment

752
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:50,760
environment as part of the development

753
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:52,740
lifecycle right because if you're going

754
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,230
into the cloud you can do it AWS you

755
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:57,660
have you do snape your amazon have

756
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,610
clicked out as cloud native tools

757
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:03,150
there's tools like redshift things like

758
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:05,699
that that inspect your accounts and you

759
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:07,740
know the proof you just basically goes

760
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:11,040
through a list of hardening checks and

761
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,900
policies for that as well so so that's

762
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:16,320
what you know used to be deploying into

763
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:19,679
a hardware environment data center is

764
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,810
becoming part of the apps X SDLC

765
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,010
processes now right so

766
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,870
we're seeing that emerging as well

767
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:27,140
actually that's that's actually an area

768
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:29,820
where I'm getting pulled into a lot more

769
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,440
as a result of some recent well

770
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:34,230
published breaches that occurred last

771
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,330
year a lot of companies are asking us

772
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:41,520
about what about our cloud you know

773
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:46,100
strategy and things of that nature so as

774
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:51,180
a matter of fact in the recent visa m--

775
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:54,719
visa in version 10 so if anybody heard

776
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:56,880
to be sim anybody a few of you yeah it's

777
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,990
a it's so gonna save it for an end that

778
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,190
I'll talk a little bit about it now

779
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:02,790
because I'm making a lot of references

780
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:05,010
to it the B sim is a is a study that's

781
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:08,960
been gone on for about ten years

782
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:11,760
started by Sid little company that as

783
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,000
basically an observational model of what

784
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,500
companies are doing not like what here's

785
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,880
what you should do theoretically it's

786
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:23,910
like here's what people are actually

787
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:26,100
doing right and so what so what happens

788
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:28,710
is it gets revised every year because

789
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:31,320
some things that people did were very

790
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:34,020
common ten years ago or not common

791
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,280
anymore right and so they kind of tear

792
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,440
it they call it maturity because the

793
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,330
least common things tend to be more

794
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,190
mature but it's basically three ranks

795
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:43,350
you know that yours your most common

796
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:44,880
activities your middle a number of

797
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:47,129
activities and the fewest number of

798
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,650
things that people do right well they

799
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:52,470
added some recently in the past to be

800
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:54,630
Sims they're really all around companies

801
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:57,300
starting to do this type of cloud work

802
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:59,130
right because before we weren't even we

803
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,510
didn't even there was just no one was

804
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,250
really doing it now we're finding out

805
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:03,810
people are starting their like hardening

806
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:07,740
as part of their application security

807
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:10,500
program cloud security basics software

808
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,690
to final governance people are starting

809
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,910
to do this not a lot of them you know is

810
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,830
this but I fully expect when we go to

811
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,390
the next year study we'll see those a

812
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:20,490
lot of these things move from a level

813
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:22,440
three which is a you know infrequent to

814
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:24,900
a level two more frequently observed

815
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:29,040
activity because there's there's a lot

816
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:30,270
of interest in this right now and then

817
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,430
you're eventually in production and

818
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:34,230
that's you know where you have red

819
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:35,500
team's bug bounties things you're you

820
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:38,590
know that you

821
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:41,200
that that you have there and you know

822
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:43,270
the king whatever happens there in

823
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,770
production at that point it's deployed

824
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:47,110
it's got to go back into the backlog

825
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:48,100
right it's too late sprint sorry you

826
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,559
know that you might be already having

827
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:55,209
spread on their way there's there's you

828
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:57,639
know whole ways to dealing with that and

829
00:33:55,210 --> 00:34:00,070
what I refer to what I refer to things

830
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,860
that aren't inside this is these things

831
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:09,520
that are gold colored here or out of

832
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:14,500
band activities alright Saudi gets

833
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:16,149
started so you define you first of all

834
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,969
you need us you need us create an

835
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:24,960
application security group an SSG a

836
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:27,399
software security group you wish and so

837
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,260
define the roles and responsibilities

838
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,770
the champions program things of that

839
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,440
nature

840
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:34,119
okay you need to establish a risk but

841
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,429
you need to adapt the process based on

842
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:38,440
what is acceptable in your company in

843
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:40,330
terms of risk what you're gonna argue an

844
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,070
agile shop you still doing waterfall

845
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:44,710
you're doing a little bit of everything

846
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:46,740
you need to adapt it and I'll talk a

847
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:50,320
little bit about that then you need to

848
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:52,330
phase in some new capabilities now you

849
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,800
went over a whole lot of stuff obviously

850
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:56,469
you can't do all these things at once

851
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,480
right so what we want to see is like a

852
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:00,129
well balanced like an inch you know an

853
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,950
inch deep and a mile wide type of

854
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,599
strategy right a well balanced strategy

855
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:07,330
across the different disciplines from

856
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:10,720
you know policies to all the way to pen

857
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:13,450
testing right is this roll out you know

858
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,279
a few of them initially okay

859
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,930
make sure you got policies in place that

860
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,470
they're well communicated people are

861
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:24,009
trained on them all right you know put

862
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:26,470
some sort of initially you won't enforce

863
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:28,000
the gates but you need to identify you

864
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:30,040
know where you're going to hold start

865
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,869
holding people accountable like hey you

866
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,690
can't you can't release things into

867
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:35,920
production any more that has a that you

868
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,510
did you know there's a critical

869
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,450
vulnerability because it is static tool

870
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:42,040
told you you know initially it's gonna

871
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:43,419
you're gonna inform them but if

872
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,869
eventually you're going to enforce these

873
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:49,480
gates third-party management lot of uh

874
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:51,849
you know third you a lot of the company

875
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,920
you know you outsource mobile

876
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:57,280
applications to more boutique firms that

877
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,940
specialize in that you have you know

878
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:04,980
custom software developed for you you

879
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:06,970
need to start bringing in some of these

880
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,160
ignore what I said about vendor be

881
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:11,980
simple but you need to you need to start

882
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:15,279
bringing in some sort of policies your

883
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:16,770
policies and and making sure that

884
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,940
they're doing something similar right

885
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:21,670
you know holding them I can't hold them

886
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:25,420
to a certain level of accountability

887
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:27,549
right okay and probably one of the most

888
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:29,440
important things is to get metrics

889
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:31,599
because that's where rumor does when we

890
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,940
talked about the business case earlier

891
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,099
you have to have metrics to report to

892
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:39,700
executives but make sure the metrics I

893
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:41,200
mean your your CEO is not going to care

894
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,569
about how many vulnerabilities were

895
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,220
found in a month right they're gonna

896
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:47,529
care about like you know something

897
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,480
that's more tangible like you know hey

898
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:51,609
our app SEC program is it's saving us a

899
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:55,500
million dollars a month and remediation

900
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:55,500
costs for example something like that

901
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:04,780
you know so you adapt the process on

902
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:06,669
things you know what what what's the

903
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:09,700
expectation of the business right was

904
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:11,740
one what type of is it is it

905
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,450
confidential you know information that

906
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:15,520
you're protecting you know what what

907
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:18,098
type of assets are you protecting all

908
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,720
right what does it attack surface look

909
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:21,760
like what is it you know is this a

910
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,740
internet-facing application or versus

911
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,730
something that's on a couple of people's

912
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:30,339
desktops okay what type of technology is

913
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:32,109
that you know using going to cloud for

914
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:34,660
example it makes might make it a little

915
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:37,650
more risk your not risk oriented all

916
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:40,750
right and then of course regulations

917
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:44,020
that dictate a lot of what we do so

918
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:45,910
based on your risk say you know you come

919
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:49,599
up with a look at your application

920
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:51,759
portfolio and from a security

921
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,319
perspective your portfolio you probably

922
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,760
have a list of applications in your

923
00:37:53,319 --> 00:38:00,460
portfolio of app apps in there you want

924
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,589
to be able to disseminate discern

925
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:05,569
whether it is a high medium or low

926
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:07,759
you know or you can use some people use

927
00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:10,339
a scale from 0 to 100 you know anything

928
00:38:07,759 --> 00:38:11,689
over a 37 guess it's this treatment but

929
00:38:10,339 --> 00:38:13,609
basically based on the risk of the

930
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:15,828
application for example internet-facing

931
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:18,140
application then we take we process

932
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:21,019
credit card information you know for

933
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:23,509
example we move money with it so it's a

934
00:38:21,019 --> 00:38:24,919
high-risk application so hey do we have

935
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:28,189
a champion assigned to that development

936
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:30,229
team yep we got that we're doing threat

937
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:31,640
models we're doing all these so we do we

938
00:38:30,229 --> 00:38:34,788
do everything on those but then we have

939
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:36,739
other applications you know that aren't

940
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:38,869
that important you know they have very

941
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:41,180
low risk but you still you know I still

942
00:38:38,869 --> 00:38:43,160
want to champion with them ideally you

943
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,538
know in this case and are we doing a

944
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,769
little code review on it we're looking

945
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:47,809
at the open source that we're bringing

946
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:51,258
in maybe from a licensing perspective -

947
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:54,170
all right all right so you do less thing

948
00:38:51,259 --> 00:38:55,789
so you so the the process the takeaway

949
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:57,650
here is the processes it needs to be

950
00:38:55,789 --> 00:39:07,459
adapted based on the risk of the

951
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:10,759
application right and we have kind of

952
00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:13,910
like this path to maturity which you

953
00:39:10,759 --> 00:39:16,489
know for instance so you start ad hoc

954
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:18,769
you know many a lot of companies are

955
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:21,739
down here you know big companies you

956
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:23,390
know and they they're perfectly fine

957
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:26,449
staying there that's just where it is

958
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:28,660
that's good enough for them you know but

959
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:31,459
a lot of companies that really want to

960
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,199
can't afford to lose the trust of the

961
00:39:31,459 --> 00:39:35,118
customer they need to move fast and so

962
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:37,699
forth they want to get over to this

963
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,529
optimize side and what an interesting

964
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:41,239
thing we're seeing is companies now or

965
00:39:39,529 --> 00:39:44,179
that are just starting to really take on

966
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:45,170
AB sec seriously are really kind of just

967
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:46,789
jumping right in

968
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:48,650
in the optimized feet they're jumping

969
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:50,689
right in with this you know let's go

970
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:54,709
ahead and you're in start with this

971
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:56,779
process of you know getting the

972
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:58,459
champions in place getting the the the

973
00:39:56,779 --> 00:40:00,019
development light it tools integrated

974
00:39:58,459 --> 00:40:03,529
with the development lifecycle things

975
00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:05,209
like that right so where you jump in

976
00:40:03,529 --> 00:40:06,499
here doesn't you don't have to start at

977
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:08,808
the bottom left that's what I'm getting

978
00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:10,698
at you can depending on their culture

979
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:12,949
and things of your company you can jump

980
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:16,039
right in and say like hey look we have a

981
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:16,770
Jenkins tool chain we have you know

982
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:19,500
we're

983
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:21,660
we're an agile shop we could be swatting

984
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,760
any size size of company matters right

985
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:26,460
here be a smaller company you don't

986
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,170
really need a lot of ceremony around you

987
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,770
know you know governance and things of

988
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,650
that nature

989
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:33,450
but you're not regulated potentially you

990
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:36,180
might be able to jump right in and get

991
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:39,390
into this you know tool oriented

992
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:40,649
governance model right you know the

993
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:42,560
important thing though is is to make

994
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:44,670
sure the developers are enable and their

995
00:40:42,560 --> 00:41:03,150
expectations are set properly with them

996
00:40:44,670 --> 00:41:07,320
upfront okay yeah so here's an example

997
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:09,540
just I just put this together some

998
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:14,400
things like you notice I we've got all

999
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:16,080
these practices alright and you can you

1000
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,060
can phase them you know we can phase in

1001
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,120
some capabilities balance it across the

1002
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:25,620
different practices right if you go to

1003
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:27,990
be simcom you'll find a really good

1004
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:29,819
framework for organizing your thinking

1005
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:32,009
and and thoughts around how you want to

1006
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:35,250
group things together and how you want

1007
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:37,170
to approach this right okay so it's

1008
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:43,560
phased in you know across disciplines

1009
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:48,990
year one year two and here's a real-life

1010
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:51,120
case study of an application that of a

1011
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:52,939
company that invested actually was the

1012
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,470
same company I used the the metrics on a

1013
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:58,430
in the in the first slide at the

1014
00:41:55,470 --> 00:42:01,470
beginning you know what they invested in

1015
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:03,120
and as you can tell they put a lot of

1016
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:05,040
money into it but they wanted to become

1017
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,990
a world-class organization within three

1018
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,220
years well you know what it you know it

1019
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:13,529
cost a lot of money to do that but so

1020
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:16,200
running you know so now they're they're

1021
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:17,940
very innovative you know they've got the

1022
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,649
dev stick ops alignment and things of

1023
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:21,650
that nature right so

1024
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:31,249
so a little bit on the B sim again if

1025
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:33,469
you go to be simcom you'll see that

1026
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:37,218
there's a the most recent BC m10 studies

1027
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:39,380
published there's open source and you

1028
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:41,269
know you'll find data around all these

1029
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:45,739
areas so each of these the Beeson is

1030
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:46,999
structured into these four domains each

1031
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:50,089
of the domains have three different

1032
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:51,379
practices in it and then women within

1033
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:53,019
the practices there's a number of

1034
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:57,859
activities that varies

1035
00:42:53,019 --> 00:43:01,669
there's 119 120 activities in the BCM

1036
00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:03,950
now no company does them all not a

1037
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:07,130
single company does them all I mean most

1038
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:08,479
you know most companies do about a third

1039
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:10,430
of them or fourth of them something

1040
00:43:08,479 --> 00:43:12,499
around that right but those are things

1041
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:14,538
that we actually observe people doing in

1042
00:43:12,499 --> 00:43:16,368
May and you can use it as a business as

1043
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:17,989
a management tool to see like how that

1044
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:19,729
makes sense in our company right you can

1045
00:43:17,989 --> 00:43:21,109
we go look at it and say and it you'll

1046
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:24,140
see they're like in it they'll say like

1047
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:26,869
you know 76 companies are doing this

1048
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:28,729
it's like a it's like you know a very

1049
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:30,619
common one like you know coding

1050
00:43:28,729 --> 00:43:32,239
standards or something like that

1051
00:43:30,619 --> 00:43:36,979
and he says we should probably do that

1052
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:38,749
too because it's so common right and

1053
00:43:36,979 --> 00:43:41,118
then you'll see some things that are not

1054
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:43,519
common and you say might really apply to

1055
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,349
what you're doing though so it's a it's

1056
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:47,390
a it's a good way to look at it if you

1057
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:49,160
want to look at a good holistic view of

1058
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:51,259
all the things you should consider and

1059
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,058
like pick a dozen things out of that say

1060
00:43:51,259 --> 00:43:54,289
let's let's go take this go take these

1061
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:59,539
things on if you're just getting started

1062
00:43:54,289 --> 00:44:03,589
okay with that I think that's I talked

1063
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:09,739
about this earlier and yeah so I'll just

1064
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:12,019
uh I don't have a table here so unique

1065
00:44:09,739 --> 00:44:15,229
wise give us a few minutes for some QA

1066
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:16,729
and so you want to come up and talk to

1067
00:44:15,229 --> 00:44:19,089
me or whatever I'll be here for a few

1068
00:44:16,729 --> 00:44:19,089
more minutes

1069
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:33,640
I think the big yeah the yes I think

1070
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,779
that yeah right if there's other some

1071
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,819
other frame I think the big difference

1072
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:38,320
what I like about it is it's just a

1073
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:40,180
study of what people are actually doing

1074
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,670
as opposed to what they should you

1075
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:45,759
someone says they should be doing right

1076
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:47,890
and it's a and it's a very broadly

1077
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,050
scoped too so it's not just focused in

1078
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:52,600
on testing types of testing and things

1079
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:54,820
like that it goes from like what is

1080
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,640
legal and compliance and you know what

1081
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:59,620
does oath group doing so forces but to

1082
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,299
me what makes it valuable is based on

1083
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:03,790
real data what companies are really

1084
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:05,890
doing and you can use that harvest ad

1085
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:08,470
data and base your initiative and your

1086
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:12,970
decisions on data right as opposed to

1087
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:15,759
like you know a theory like which is

1088
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:17,439
this is good too but it's but you know

1089
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,860
it's more so this is one more scientific

1090
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:24,430
base but I view it as a management tool

1091
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:26,290
not it yeah as it says here's what

1092
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:28,990
companies are doing it's there's enough

1093
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:31,660
of them in there that you know it's just

1094
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:34,439
it's the relevance typically right to do

1095
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,440
that as well

1096
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:48,259
all right you guys are all gonna go out

1097
00:45:41,240 --> 00:46:04,069
and start a knapsack program now yeah

1098
00:45:48,260 --> 00:46:07,520
again again getting ramped up yeah all

1099
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:19,310
right yeah or something like that yeah

1100
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:26,960
yeah right yeah in this in this deck

1101
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:31,279
here there's this year up here when I

1102
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,960
talked about it this may be animation

1103
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,340
right here okay

1104
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:42,560
this this is this this is this one here

1105
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:44,870
so basically you can use like some some

1106
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,640
metrics so so if you're if you're are

1107
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:49,370
you doing testing today any at all like

1108
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:54,350
after product once in pin test yeah it's

1109
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:55,970
not so you know and so take a take a

1110
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:58,460
look at what what the vulnerabilities

1111
00:46:55,970 --> 00:47:00,350
are done there and start looking at this

1112
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:02,060
take a sample of them and say uh how

1113
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:03,740
long how long did it take for us to get

1114
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:06,500
them completed you know it has to go

1115
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:08,270
through some sort of review process it's

1116
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,770
got to be assigned to developers it's

1117
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:12,560
got to be tested it's got to be

1118
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:14,300
re-released it could be something you

1119
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,880
have to communicate the clients take the

1120
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:19,340
whole cost right and basically I can

1121
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:22,400
come up with uh some sort of that bar on

1122
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:24,050
the right there right and then what you

1123
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,350
can do is you can start you can go and

1124
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:29,360
look at this this economics of software

1125
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:32,299
security what carmakers can teach

1126
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:34,730
enterprises i under dark reading this

1127
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:36,800
article here it'll talk about how you

1128
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:40,940
break that down but basically you can

1129
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:43,580
use some well-known metrics that say

1130
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:45,050
like okay this thing is a much cheaper

1131
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:47,420
to fix if it's done in requirements

1132
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:49,790
right there's you know there's an old

1133
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:52,610
study done by in the sei but guy named

1134
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:56,330
very being the BOE

1135
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:58,460
hm I think or BOE ehem what was it but

1136
00:47:56,330 --> 00:48:00,500
it was done in that like in the 70s and

1137
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:02,750
and it's kind of waterfall rooted but

1138
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:04,850
it's still still very valid but

1139
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:06,230
basically it just says that things are

1140
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:08,150
you know ten thousand times more

1141
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:11,240
expensive to fix in production than if

1142
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:14,390
you fix it in you know in a requirements

1143
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:15,919
document right and you can decimal with

1144
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:21,620
this so you can translate it that way

1145
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:23,510
right it's very helpful to kind of if if

1146
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:25,660
you're just taking on a knapsack program

1147
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:30,320
you're having a hard time justifying it

1148
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:32,690
to to get your doodoo pen tested or deep

1149
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,670
and on your like really get some pen

1150
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:36,320
testers and code reviews down on your

1151
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:39,380
most critical apps and really break them

1152
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:41,420
and find a lot of good stuff and then

1153
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:43,040
you can start using that as but if you

1154
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,330
made that it's like that's those are

1155
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,400
things that people are not even aware of

1156
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:48,140
right and you can say here's the stuff

1157
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,730
we're living with today we want we don't

1158
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:51,920
we want to you know quit doing this

1159
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:54,350
right we want to not do this anymore

1160
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,640
because you're looking they may or may

1161
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:57,680
not want to fix those because you're

1162
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,839
already been lettuce living with it you

1163
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,060
know so but you know probably I want to

1164
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:34,040
keep going down that same path so here's

1165
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:35,630
a way forward yeah back in the day man

1166
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:37,750
with the arts and manufacturing firms

1167
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:40,760
but there's not enough of them to be

1168
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:43,160
segmented off as a vertical yeah it's

1169
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:45,650
important I got to get around fifteen or

1170
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:50,440
so not that many in there yeah not yet

1171
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:53,060
anyway but yeah some automakers and

1172
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:56,260
embedded systems you know things like

1173
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:56,259
that are are in there

1174
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:17,460
more and more they're putting them

1175
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:19,860
together yeah but in the past it was

1176
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,940
definitely are you talking about within

1177
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:25,050
the company itself

1178
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:27,030
yeah yeah yeah right yeah and so yes

1179
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:28,710
it's funny enough because those why

1180
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:30,420
these companies don't have developers

1181
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:33,090
they have engineers right you know right

1182
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:39,030
and that right code right and it's even

1183
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:41,040
worse so so yeah so it's like so you'd

1184
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:43,380
see every you definitely need to tailor

1185
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,450
things to those environments still

1186
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:47,630
champions a lot all these things all

1187
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:56,879
these things still apply design flaws

1188
00:50:47,630 --> 00:51:01,220
the basic tenants are still there I very

1189
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:06,110
good all right thank you

1190
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:06,109
[Applause]

1191
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:12,270
you
