1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,769
before he left office jeh Johnson is

2
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,389
secretary of home

3
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,980
security named elections critical

4
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,779
infrastructure caused this problem

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,369
between the north and south and the

6
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,779
states and the federal government so

7
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,039
forth we didn't want the federal

8
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,630
government stepping in tell us how to

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,060
run elections okay

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,279
Trump's people came in and a month

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,259
afterwards John Kelly the new Secretary

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,180
of Homeland Security validated what jeh

13
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:34,739
Johnson had done so whether we liked it

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,230
or not we were stuck with the elections

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,309
is critical is our infrastructure and so

16
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,288
we decided it was time to get on board

17
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,760
and not fight the federal government to

18
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:43,079
figure its figure out what critical

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,920
infrastructure meant so this is going to

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,570
be a long answer to why they did that

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,300
because it took us over a year and a

22
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,440
half almost two years to figure out why

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:01:07,350
the government federal government had

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:09,570
done that so the what we've got going is

25
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,048
not just Revolutionary War don't think

26
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,270
about our 1776 this is more on the big

27
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:17,610
scheme of things so the pen is mightier

28
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,170
than the sword kind of stuff the Spirit

29
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,090
is the physical as three is the one

30
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,350
that's Napoleon if you have the mind to

31
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,420
go do something it's more important than

32
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,809
having the physical capability it's the

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,369
will that wins out

34
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,859
Clausewitz war is a continuation of

35
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,170
politics by other means the indirect

36
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:35,939
approach Liddell Hart okay the best the

37
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,340
major victories the best victories are

38
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,109
won through the indirect approach not

39
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,240
the the frontal assault type things and

40
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:44,098
so Revolutionary War doesn't form to

41
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,249
battle damages assessments it's not

42
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:49,469
physical stuff okay it's ideology and it

43
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:51,568
adapts and you can't attack an ideology

44
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:52,949
if you can get the people and that sort

45
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:55,319
of thing but you can't go attack an

46
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,939
ideology so I refer you and go attack al

47
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:58,619
Qaeda we can take out Osama bin Laden

48
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,348
and what happens Isis pops up somewhere

49
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,520
else that's an example of it okay

50
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:04,079
Vietnam you know we won every battle

51
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,038
they never beat us on the battlefield

52
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,389
but who won that war okay so what you

53
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,208
got going is these competing ideologies

54
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:14,130
between Russia and the United States and

55
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:16,410
so we confuse sometimes you know

56
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:19,590
communism versus democracy communism

57
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:22,730
versus capitalism and so forth communism

58
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:25,440
is just this ideology over there okay

59
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,790
we've got liberalism capitalism

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,690
democracy and so forth that's what's

61
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,410
going on here so

62
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,700
had three cold wars with Russia to begin

63
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,500
going on for a hundred years

64
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,700
all right what I'm gonna get around to

65
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,170
is there's nothing new Under the Sun

66
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,149
what they're doing to us today they've

67
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,559
been doing for a hundred years so here's

68
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,290
some examples all right

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,310
the Great War that's when Russia the

70
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:49,200
Bolshevik Revolution began u.s. wasn't

71
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,820
quite dominant in the world yet we're so

72
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,380
getting our feet underneath us and they

73
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,299
get started meddling with us

74
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,880
all right well the three Cold War's

75
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,460
that's the first a second is 46 to 88

76
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,750
and then the last one is you know from

77
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,030
about the time of Bosnia and the

78
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,050
expansion of NATO to the day so let's

79
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,250
take a look at each of those real

80
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,620
quickly

81
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,990
Moscow creates the Communist

82
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,660
international here okay and it urges the

83
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,060
US Communist Party to pursue regime

84
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:19,590
change here in the United States okay so

85
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:24,000
they're pushing that I'm sorry we don't

86
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:25,770
recognize Russia until 1933 and we say

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,580
if you'll quit meddling with us we'll

88
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,990
recognize you

89
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,600
well we recognize them but they didn't

90
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:35,100
stop meddling with us okay here's their

91
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:38,100
propaganda piece becomes an implement of

92
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,390
it's a propaganda weapon for them so

93
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,859
anything that's communism is

94
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,738
peace-loving anything that's capitalism

95
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,840
is war mongering in their ideology all

96
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,940
right so they start masquerading

97
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,709
military offenses as postures of peace

98
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,320
so you see this doublespeak that's weird

99
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,920
like George Orwell got his 1984 idea

100
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,250
okay

101
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:59,309
it's doublespeak you'll be given a gun

102
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,570
you've learned art the war you don't win

103
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,690
by good intentions you do it by

104
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:06,109
disarming people a number of countries

105
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:09,780
this will all lead to revolution and

106
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:13,140
every peace program is a deception for

107
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,840
revolutionary struggle here it was a

108
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,539
split within Russia itself between

109
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,910
Trotsky and Stalin Trotsky said all-out

110
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,230
fight all the time don't ever capitulate

111
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,390
fight fight fight

112
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,220
Stalin was more of a realist he said hey

113
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:29,960
we've got to be able to hit coexist so

114
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:32,850
we see in world war ii at coexistence

115
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:36,419
but you see this zigzagging of what

116
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,729
truth is peace is good war is bad and

117
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:41,159
you see Russia back going back and forth

118
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:42,899
between this revolutionary youth front

119
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:44,580
trained to youth the fight to

120
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:46,949
non-aggression pact to invading Poland

121
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,330
to attacking us isolation you see it

122
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:50,489
going back and forth there is no real

123
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,419
truth we're gonna change truth then

124
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:56,489
whatever fits the the moment

125
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:57,628
so the second Cold War is after World

126
00:04:56,489 --> 00:05:00,058
War two there are actually a couple

127
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:01,619
years of peace or truce between us all

128
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:03,569
right after but once it was time to

129
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:05,459
divide up Europe didn't Russia wanted us

130
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,959
to get out of there and so you see this

131
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:08,369
division in Berlin and so forth

132
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,580
Churchill says and Iron Curtain has

133
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:13,949
fallen over Europe okay

134
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,869
Russia starts we start the UN and they

135
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:17,219
start this World Peace Council and they

136
00:05:15,869 --> 00:05:20,759
soon to get expelled because they were

137
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:22,860
so you know extreme or whatever you get

138
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:26,759
into the 50s with Sputnik and space race

139
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:29,699
Berlin wall and so forth here are some

140
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,679
examples of their postures of peace okay

141
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:35,999
defensive major are these defensive

142
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:37,469
let's see if this works here does this

143
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:41,300
look like a defensive measure to you

144
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:41,300
this is them rolling into Hungary 1956

145
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:49,800
it doesn't look like a real peaceful

146
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:51,419
inverted intrusion for me it looks like

147
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,649
a military okay here we enter the Czech

148
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,649
Republic 1968

149
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,260
then in Afghanistan in 1979

150
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,180
khrushchev we must push them to the

151
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,950
grave you Americans are gullible you

152
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,200
won't accept communism outright so we'll

153
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,969
feed you small doses and one day you'll

154
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,770
wake up funds that you've got communism

155
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,040
right will conquer you without firing a

156
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,930
shot

157
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,920
that's Khrushchev big time Vietnam some

158
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,130
of your in here

159
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:40,100
maybe that's remember it well okay they

160
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:42,230
just rolled out man in throughout the

161
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,170
United States and peace becomes a weapon

162
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:47,750
to disarm us materially saying you know

163
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:49,340
don't proliferate the arms and shipments

164
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,670
and everything to Vietnam but it's also

165
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,950
to disarm a psychologically students for

166
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:57,230
a Democratic Society organized protests

167
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,960
all over America these are all either

168
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:03,710
started by or exacerbated by Russian

169
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:06,049
influences you see all these Los Angeles

170
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,340
Chicago in New York and so forth now

171
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,770
there's a split just remember helped

172
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,119
ROTC Trotsky and Stalin split there's a

173
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,000
split here in the United States between

174
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,270
the Communist Party they wanted to go

175
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,570
after this bigger issue of going after

176
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,070
the United States as an as a society the

177
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,900
Socialist Workers Party had a single

178
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,790
issue just withdrawal from Vietnam so

179
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,320
you see you know Trotsky said fight us

180
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,030
all the time Stalin said will coexist

181
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:33,020
you see us split within the Communist

182
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:34,640
Party here inside the United States you

183
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,159
need both the defense and offense like

184
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,640
dark needs light to understand one

185
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,490
another

186
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:43,700
the defense is peace okay we're going to

187
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:46,010
disarm and love you sing Kumbaya on all

188
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,510
that offense you need to go actually get

189
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,880
inside infiltrate and then do something

190
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:57,950
on the other side to change the outcome

191
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:59,330
all right mobilization committee there

192
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,090
was in the United States there was a

193
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:05,120
genuine pacifist movement but it was

194
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:07,039
small was insignificant or not any of

195
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,600
the large demonstrations that you if you

196

198
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:15,669
demonstration Russia was part of it

199
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,169
behind it making it worse and so forth

200
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:19,659

201
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:22,940

trouble in today's world 2016 election

215
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:57,020
same thing that's going on back in the

216
00:08:52,250 --> 00:09:02,810
60s nothing new Under the Sun chokes we

217

have volume on this I'll tell you what

218
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:08,390
he's saying this is a KGB agent defected

219
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:11,480
in 1983 he's telling us about the KGB

220
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:14,540
budget he says that 15 percent is

221
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,630
basically what you think of as James

222
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:20,480
Bond kind of stuff kind of espionage 85

223
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:23,240
percent is active aggressive subversion

224
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,920
we're going to actively openly come

225
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,140
inside your country and mess with you

226
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,880
that's what it means okay that's what

227
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,840
he's telling us they're doing that 1983

228
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,480
that's Cold War era

229
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:37,250
KGB tactics when do you think Putin was

230
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:41,240
trained 1980 okay thank you seventies

231
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:43,730
1980s so Putin black belt judo karate

232
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,350
expert and all that sort of stuff KGB

233
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,360
trained is doing the same thing that

234
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:55,160
they did to us during the Cold War is

235
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:57,080
they're doing to us now okay this is my

236
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,880
own personal experience with this okay

237
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,030
caught between the superpowers between

238
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,150
the US and Russia all right

239
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:07,160
Panama we actually captured insurgents

240
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:09,800
on the hillsides in Panama Russian

241
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,079
agents inside Panama with maps and it

242
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,569
showed what was communist what was

243
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,790
capitalist in Latin and South America

244
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:19,010
and it was about 50/50 so if you're a

245
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,599
country in Latin America do we want to

246
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,090
go with the Soviets or do we want to go

247
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,220
with the Americans that was 1989 a

248
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:27,200
couple years later I'm in Peru

249
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,270
we're fighting Sendero Luminoso or they

250
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,160
are and we're helping train them okay

251
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:33,680
The Shining plat path and in the

252
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,969
Peruvian military one country their

253
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:41,209
military their army was 90% Russian

254
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:45,410
trained tactics weapons and 10% American

255
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:46,998
Navy was earther their Navy was 50/50

256
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,309
and their Air Force and it's 90 percent

257
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:52,209
American 10 percent Russians in one

258
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:54,410
country you had the three military's

259
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:56,628
siding with one or the other he got to

260
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,709
pick their own all right they didn't

261
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:58,970
know whether Americans were going to

262
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:00,679
went out in capitalism or whether

263
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,240
Russians and communism was going to

264
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:08,360
point out playing out in the nineties

265
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:10,069
okay in the 90s we after they the wall

266
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,290
comes down and everything Soviet Union

267
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:14,118
implodes it's now back to Russia we

268
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,529
start pushing the promotion to democracy

269
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:17,179
so just like we think they're meddling

270
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:19,309
in our affairs they think that we're

271
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:21,949
meddling in their affairs in 2000 that's

272
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:23,660
amidst a typo 2001 it's 2011

273
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:25,790
Hillary Clinton is Secretary of State

274
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:29,480
metals in the Russians elections against

275
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:31,219
Putin so 2016 is get even tile all right

276
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,399
and other things that are going on all

277
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,110
right

278
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,119
it's a more defensive so-called

279
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:38,629
defensive operations Crimea in 14 and

280
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:40,550
Ukraine today high political spectrum

281
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:44,329
real quick here's on the right okay

282
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:46,309
you've got conservatives aristocracies

283
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:51,258
all the way up to top their totalitarian

284
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:54,410
regimes okay here it is on the Left okay

285
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:56,569
liberalism socialist communism and so

286
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,368
forth okay when you put it all together

287
00:11:56,569 --> 00:11:59,748
that's what you've got we tend to think

288
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:03,860
of things on a spectrum of left to right

289
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:05,199
here's the reality okay over here you

290
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:08,269
start getting towards author

291
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:10,429
authoritarianism I can't say that word

292
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,600
over here you got the same sort of thing

293
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,279
the further you go to the left to the

294
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,299
right the more you got towards one

295
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:20,329
person calling the shots and so here we

296
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:21,860
tend to think of Nazis over here on the

297
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:24,859
right remember it's the National

298
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:27,350
Socialist Workers Party is what not C

299
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,209
stands for socialism okay so you really

300
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:32,299
have Nazism on both left right as an

301
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:35,059
example of the authoritarian ISM at work

302
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:37,160
so this is what you really have is you

303
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:38,779
have the far left and the far right

304
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,449
really more like a horseshoe coming

305
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:43,639
together towards a totalitarian regime

306
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:46,609
your democracy is on the end of it oh

307
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:51,100
they're into it all right so that's why

308
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:54,420
you have in today's world here

309
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:58,080
Wall Street Journal or whatever okay

310
00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:03,120
the new Beijing Moscow axis why would

311
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:06,180
communist you know Russia and China be

312
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,160
working together because of this right

313
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:13,109
here okay it's it's totalitarianism

314
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:16,350
authoritarianism and they are more

315
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:18,210
aligned than up here on the democracies

316
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,800
so what Russia is up to

317
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,600
three-dimensional chess there the chess

318
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,459
masters ten of the top twenty chess

319
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,560
players in the entire world are Russian

320
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,060
ok there's a reason for that

321
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,829
ok you like to think deeply and all this

322
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,390
kind of stuff to outsmart their

323
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,920
opponents and that's what they're doing

324
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,660
with us here and the Russian melding and

325
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,420
our elections is trying out thank us and

326
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,680
so their immediate first dimension they

327
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,000
want to affect the candidacy they want

328
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,459
to be for Trump take down Hillary

329
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,710
something like that ok they want us to

330
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,960
question there are a particular election

331
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:48,240
legitimacy or they want to promote a

332
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,500
desired outcome now there could be a

333
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,120
difference think Russia might went

334
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,370
through do you think China wants Trump

335
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,900
right now not necessarily so there are

336
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:57,900
some differences over there all right

337
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,730
midterm they want us they don't want me

338
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,530
to trust you you to trust me blacks

339
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,120
don't trust whites rich they don't trust

340
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,560
poor class warfare they want us to get

341
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,690
us turn on each other they want to

342
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,010
pulverize the politics they want to push

343
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,960
the right further the right thing will

344
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,850
pushed us further it'll definitely don't

345
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,930
want anybody to trust the government and

346
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,400
then long term they want to promote

347
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,069
Russian interests they want to divide

348
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,090
the West they want to get rid of NATO

349
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,260
three-dimensional chess so they're

350
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,670
working on all of those while were

351
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,740
sitting here worrying can they hack a

352
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,910
machine at the hackathon in Las Vegas

353
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,710
we're sitting ere we're playing

354
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:30,030
one-dimension checkers they're playing

355
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:32,880
three-dimensional chess with us they're

356
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:34,829
at asymmetric warfare asymmetric warfare

357
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,080
cyber attacks you all know so well

358
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:40,170
disinformation drones did you know that

359
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:42,420
they've actually Isis has used hobby

360
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,969
shop drones and drop grenades on us in

361
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,310
Iraq so here we have air superiority we

362
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:49,470
spend billions of dollars with our Air

363
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:51,380
Force and get the hottest fighters we

364
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,090
can put up shields we can put up

365
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:58,530
anti-missile stuff we we control the air

366
00:14:54,090 --> 00:15:00,180
and they buy $100 drone from Hobby Lobby

367
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,130
and stick a grenade on it fly it over

368
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,630
and we were totally helpless we didn't

369
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,850
know how to fight against it now we're

370
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:07,170
coming online independent but when they

371
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,280
first started flying the games that's

372
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,770
asymmetric warfare

373
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,750
okay it's like when a submarine tries to

374
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,699
attack a helicopter and vice versa okay

375
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,800
doesn't work real good two different

376
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,480
platforms okay that's what here's what

377
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,520
General Thomas has it we had no answer

378
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,300
an absolutely asymmetric counter to the

379
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,300
by the enemy

380
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,770
underneath our air superiority and

381
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,930
you're gonna see how that plays out in

382
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:31,590
the cyber world as we move into it a

383
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:33,150
couple of quick examples election

384
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:36,060
meddling real quick in the Ukraine

385
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:38,069
totally BS right here what they did on

386
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,050
election night cuz they took a

387
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,880
screenshot changes the results pushed it

388
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:44,640
out to get everybody to distrust the

389
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,110
elections in Ukraine this guy right here

390
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,330
didn't have thirty percent of the vote

391
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,980
he had one percent of the vote less than

392
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,300
one percent of the vote but that's what

393
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,300
they pushed out so that everybody in

394
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,550
Ukraine okay

395
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,469
the this is pro Russia this is pro

396
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:00,060
Europe they said that this nationalist

397
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,680
over here they've gotten thirty percent

398
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,739
of the vote just to tick off everybody

399
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,810
over here on this side total BS just and

400
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,310
they knew they're gonna get caught the

401
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,079
next day but it was enough to cost

402
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,130
confusion right now we've just had the

403
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,130
election in Kentucky

404
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:16,680
okay Beshear and Bevin and so forth and

405
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:18,089
if they had just changed the results how

406
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,949
would you how would you know who do you

407
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:22,980
know who to trust and whatnot that's the

408
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,790
power that's why hacked one machine when

409
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,690
you can hack you know a news agency or

410
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,400
election results of the Secretary of

411
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,970
State's website that's where the threat

412
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:34,650
is not on a hacking machine okay so they

413
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:38,040
just want to promote instability get

414
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:39,660
protests distrust and so forth but it's

415
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,800
not just an election seaweed all wrapped

416
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,030
around the axle especially we have

417
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,680
secretary states get wrapped around the

418
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,060
axle without elections it's a lot more

419
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,199
than elections folks what the Russians

420
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:51,479
are up to this Malaysian airliner the

421
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,040
got shot down they're dealing in that

422
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,720
you know at the Olympics with my deal

423
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,750
talk about the Olympics in a minute in

424
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,700
Estonia they joined NATO in 2004 the

425
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:02,280
Russians didn't like in 2007 they moved

426
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,990
a statue of a Russian war soldier from

427
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,599
World War two from downtown Taunton and

428
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:07,980
outside the the city cemetery the

429
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,510
Russians didn't like it took offense had

430
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,510
the very next day they launched the

431
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:17,069
first nation in nation's cyber attack

432
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:18,599
just to mess with the Estonians the

433
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,099
motion shoot down they hacked it to

434
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,750
change the narrative to confusion

435
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:23,250
citizens who did it

436
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,470
we all know you'll see you here a minute

437
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:28,099
we all know twas the Russians okay in

438
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:30,810
the Olympics all right

439
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:32,219
the politics has been going on for quite

440
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,110
some time a lot of different protest

441
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,230
boycotts and so forth they're just some

442
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:38,310
examples I want to highlight down here

443
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,840
because of the Russian invasion in

444
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:41,460
Afghanistan I showed you film clip

445
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,439
earlier the very next year Jimmy Carter

446
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,120
boycotted the Moscow Olympics then they

447
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,830
retaliated four years later they

448
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,159
boycotted the Russian Olympics that's

449
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:51,990
gonna play out here in a minute in 1980

450
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,430
when they had the Olympics in Moscow it

451
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,040
was called the chemists game because all

452
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,360
the Russians were doping alright

453
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:00,659
43 medals over time have been stripped

454
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,030
more than 30% of all the the the medals

455
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,040
from all the countries in the world 30%

456
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,980
of them more than that have been removed

457
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:11,510
by because the Russians have been doping

458
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:17,040
alright I'm sorry

459
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:18,030
caught doping in 2010 2012 2014 folks if

460
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,909
you haven't seen it watch the

461
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,590
documentary called Icarus and it shows

462
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:26,070
you how this all played out right here

463
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:28,860
all right Minna 2015 they got suspended

464
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:30,360
and Russians ban in 2018 watch this

465
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,419
documentary if you're interested in this

466
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,800
at all it's powerful here's the

467
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:37,530
connection between the Olympics and

468
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,470
elections it's the people working for

469
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:42,420
the Russian intelligence all right these

470
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,300
three guys right here involved in the

471
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:47,520
anti-doping efforts all right basically

472
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,440
changes the results of actually what

473
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,020
they did in the movie Icarus and it's

474
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,820
true true documentary the Russian since

475
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,290
it was in Sochi they had a little break

476
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,149
in the corner of the building and it

477
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,740
might they would pull that brick out and

478
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,440
he'd take out the hot urine from inside

479
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,760
and pass him positive or good urine and

480
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,410
stick it back inside and that we all

481
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,120
exposed it all okay that's how they got

482
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,830
out and so all their they got all the

483
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,389
gold medals you know from doping and so

484
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:13,020
forth well the people we're doing that

485
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:15,930
these guys right here when we bust them

486
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,940
over here or wanted in the FBI for

487
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:22,110

who shows up save guys start proving

489
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,350
they're hacking methods over here in the

490
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:29,790
Olympics they just bring it to work over

491
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:31,459
here in the US some elections they don't

492
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,870
even try to hide some of this all right

493
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,520
greetings citizens of the world we

494

world anti-doping agency databases and

498
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,410

499
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,970
gonna tell us that they were shocked

500
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,950
because the Russians were doping no

501
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,480
they're not turn change the narrative we

502
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,460
will start with the US team which is

503
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,930
disgraced it by tainted victories we

504
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,660
will also disclose exclusive information

505
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:59,190
about other national Olympic teams wait

506
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,900
for a sensational proof of our famous

507
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,910
athletes taking doping substances

508
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:08,370
anytime soon what you're talking about

509
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:10,740
is Williams and now it's Simone biles

510
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,969
okay the great American athletes they're

511
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,080
saying that they've been doping so

512
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:17,070
that's the message they're going to put

513
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:20,669
out to the world all right all of this

514
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:23,669
because of this activity remember the

515
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:25,680
basis for this class why US named

516
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:28,170
elections critical infrastructure okay

517
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,960
the military started catching on in

518
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:33,060
about 2014 the army had a Cyber Command

519
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,360
then when he became the whole US

520
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:39,810
military Cyber Command all right we have

521
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:42,330
changed back in my day i from active

522
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,710
defense an airline battle about 2010 we

523
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,720
rise or as a whole lot more than the

524
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,690
Army Navy Air Force okay now we're

525
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,470
starting to talk space specifically just

526
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,580
a year ago

527
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,730
thank you I keep hitting the wrong

528
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,560
button cyber space cyber we now

529
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:57,840
recognize that cyber is just as

530
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,429
important as the Army Navy Air Force and

531
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,810
perhaps even more so okay

532
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,910
when we start talking about all this

533
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,690
stuff here okay we're talking

534
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,820
multi-domain

535
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:07,620
operations ok and we start talking about

536
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:12,030
penetrate dissonant disintegrates

537
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:13,260
exploiting in the cyber world alright we

538
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:16,320
know the center of gravity is the

539
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,879
internet low cost high impact and this

540
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,409
is the way the russian is doing it or

541
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,640
doing it they've weaponized the internet

542
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,230
and they're doing it through social

543
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,050
media that's how you change public's

544
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,640
perception is through social media why

545
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,830
would they spend any money on a fighter

546
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,630
nowadays no reason to a whole lot more

547
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,699
effective does this send out messages

548
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,560
over this you're gonna change the

549
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,970
American public's perception a whole lot

550
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,159
more with this and you are with an

551
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:41,280
attack by a military fighter or whatever

552
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:44,160
okay so propaganda as old as war itself

553
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,170
just the new weapon does the internet

554
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,020
mobile phones social media and so forth

555
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,320
and it's intensified by our official

556
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,799
tell

557
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:55,470
and so forth all right the tactical

558
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,090
employment we've talked about some of

559
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,740
these that I want to go through a couple

560
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,389
of these so that yet the field it's a

561
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,340
whole lot more than the the Olympics

562
00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:05,549
here it is it in real world folks this

563
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:07,889
is the Netherlands a year ago and this

564
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:08,879
is the actual mobile team now we think

565
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:11,309
of the Russians as being this

566
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,529
all-powerful great you know whatever in

567
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:14,970
this world they make mistakes just like

568
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:16,980
the rest those check out this guy right

569
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:18,750
here when you zoom in on that you can

570
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,730
actually use a name and so forth so if

571
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,559
they weren't that slick all right but

572
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,809
this is their mobile team this is their

573
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,789
hacker this is like you guys except the

574
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:28,769
smart guys cyber folks coming into the

575
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:32,970
airport in the Netherlands to do an

576
00:22:28,769 --> 00:22:36,149
operation alright but the Dutch were on

577
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:38,000
top of it they caught him well as they

578
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:42,689
set up shop there they caught em alright

579
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,149
so it wasn't what their target was in

580
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,409
the Netherlands was this organization

581
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:48,178
for the prohibition of chemical weapons

582
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:49,679
because they were investigating some of

583
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:52,590
the Olympic doping and so forth in the

584
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,659
world anti-doping agency here was the

585
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:57,899
actual car that they had rented and

586
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:58,950
drove to the to the operation you can

587
00:22:57,899 --> 00:23:02,158
see all the stuff that they were

588
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:04,289
carrying with them and the beauty of the

589
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:07,950
earth not beauty this but the scary part

590
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:11,009
of this is these guys were nimble they

591
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:14,909
were girls kind of smart people set up

592
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:16,980
hack this stuff and change it as it came

593
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:18,480
in and went out and one of the FBI

594
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,120
agents was described to me in another

595
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,789
operation setting out up outside a hotel

596
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,799
room and so some guy novice like me goes

597
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:28,860
in and signs on I think I'm getting on

598
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:30,179
the hotel you know internet it's going

599
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,139
after their car they're watching

600
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:32,070
everything and then they're wrapping it

601
00:23:31,139 --> 00:23:33,959
back through and making it look like

602
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,610
it's the hotel see a lot of heads

603
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,500
nodding and so forth so you got to be

604
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:38,939
careful I'm preaching the choir here but

605
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,429
you got to be careful if you got

606
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,870
anywhere around something sensitive you

607
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:48,629
know the Russians could be sitting there

608
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:50,309
listening to you so forth so the we

609
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:51,389
caught on to what they're up to there

610
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:53,279
they were supposed to be there and go to

611
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:54,719
Switzerland because it was another eight

612
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,059
conference going on that they were going

613
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,100
to hack and so forth a lot of good Intel

614
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:01,769
came from this operation here were

615
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,030
actual photos of the surveillance this

616
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:05,010
was the building but they were

617
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:08,730
actually trying to listen in to and so

618
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:10,679
forth at the same time they were then

619
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,880
supposed to go into Malaysia and hack

620
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,710
into a conference where they were

621
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,409
changing the narrative on the shoot-down

622
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:21,030
of the Malaysian airliner killed 200 and

623
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:22,620
some people almost 300 people so that it

624
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,970
wouldn't be pinned on the Russians it

625
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,979
was gonna be penned on some other

626
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:29,460
somebody else the insurgents and so

627
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,659
forth Anti Doping we've talked about

628
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,500
that a little bit this was the

629
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,940
conference they're going to go to

630
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:37,020
10-foot so then after they were done in

631
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:40,140
The Hague here it is in the United

632
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:43,590
States set up a completely completely

633
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:46,440
100% false disinformation and attack on

634
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:48,629
a Russian or a chemical plant down in

635
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,730
Louisiana put it out in social media

636
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:53,309
called the news agencies had everybody

637
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,690
geared up people staying you know

638
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:56,668
sheltering in place in their homes and

639
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,260
so forth totally fake and they were just

640
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:59,700
doing it we think to check out first

641
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,980
responders and who was going to respond

642
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,169
FBI you know that sort of thing just

643
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,289
testing us out all right disinformation

644
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:08,700
folks here's some real-world examples in

645
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:10,980
the election arena so we've talked

646
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,539
Olympus Olympics we've talked dope

647
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,340
English talk you know what kind of stuff

648
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:17,039
here it is in the nothing in my world

649
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,720
okay so they take a pro Stacey Abrams ad

650
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,610
running for governor in Georgia they put

651
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,679
the word communist Muslim Brotherhood is

652
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:23,969
simple photoshopping but this is the

653
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,919
first thing you ever see about Stacey

654
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:28,559
Abrams are you gonna have the favorable

655
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,390
impression over probably not all right

656
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,039
that's al that's how they're messing

657
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:34,280
with our heads not not with the voting

658
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:37,379
machines they're messing with our heads

659
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,820
here it is check the date November 12 t

660
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,169
it's four days after the election so

661
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,149
they're not trying to change the outcome

662
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:43,530
of the election 2016 they're trying to

663
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,539
change your perception as to whether

664
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:47,639
Trump was appropriately elected or not

665
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:50,640
okay so they put people on the streets

666
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,140
of New York probe Trump and it Trump is

667
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,970
not my president put them on the same

668
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,340
place same time on the streets of New

669
00:25:53,970 --> 00:26:01,440
York City to fight with one another that

670
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:03,418
is meddling in our elections here it is

671
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,650
Islam see they're using our strengths

672
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:06,570
against us freedom of religion freedom

673
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,039
of press freedom of assembly freedom of

674
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:09,299
assemblies putting people on the streets

675
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:11,820
of New York City putting keep on the

676
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:15,120
streets in Houston a religion Pro Islam

677
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,769
anti Islam to get us to fight with one

678
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,168
another

679
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:20,970
here it is they particularly went after

680
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:24,690
the african-american people all right

681
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:27,299
said the because the narrative is as

682
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:29,159
they didn't want Hillary Clinton and

683
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:30,749
they assume that the african-american

684
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,700
community was going to vote for Hillary

685
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:33,929
so why hack and try to change votes if

686
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,580
you can just get the african-american

687
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:37,200
since a home will not vote those are

688
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,629
votes that aren't going to Hillary okay

689
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,240
that's nuanced that's three dimensional

690
00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:46,168
that's that's a sophisticated

691
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,899
military-style propaganda psychological

692
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:51,119
operations what that is over here here's

693
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:52,949
Trump here's Hillary I won't vote for

694
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:55,199
the oppressors just stay home just don't

695
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,659
participate that's Russian meddling in

696
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,919
our elections and then oppression you

697
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:00,960
know any time you see the Confederate

698
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,730
flag or police and you get the blue

699
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,960
lives matter black lives matter things

700
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,119
going and that sort of stuff

701
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,259
you just don't want to trust you don't

702
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:08,129
want to know what to believe

703
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,749
you don't want to trust the government

704
00:27:08,129 --> 00:27:11,759
you just want to stay home lock yourself

705
00:27:09,749 --> 00:27:15,440
away at home and so forth that's going

706
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,440
that's messing with our heads folks

707
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:55,340
if you hadn't seen that before you can

708
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:58,670
google that on your own okay it's Jordan

709
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:00,830
Peele and folks it used to be you know

710
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:02,540
only believe half of what you hear you

711
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,040
know or only half what you see nothing

712
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:07,100
what's here now don't believe anything

713
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,659
you hear or see okay because deep fakes

714
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,699
and I again I'm preaching the choir here

715
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,080
but a lot of the people that I show this

716
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,360
to have never seen this sort of thing so

717
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,820
anything that comes at us since 2020

718
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:25,280
election could just be a deep fake all

719
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:30,889
right so just be the alert out there

720
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:33,460
again you're gonna have to help me move

721
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:33,460
it on past

722
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:46,150
while they're getting that fixed any

723
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,150
questions so far

724
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:58,169
there's another one about Nancy Pelosi

725
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,210
and it's called the wraparound smear and

726
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:01,830
if you just take the initial clip that a

727
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:04,230
lot of times you see it looks like she's

728
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:07,320
telling her people to put out false

729
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:09,570
information report on it get it to

730
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,220
mainstream media and then you've created

731
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:12,480
a completely false narrative so it

732
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,030
sounds like she's telling people that

733
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,610
what to do when you google didn't get

734
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:19,020
the entire presentation right she's

735
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:21,389
saying that that's what the Republicans

736
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:24,090
are doing to her and the reason I show

737
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:25,290
that is because that's what the Russians

738
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:28,470
are doing to us they're putting

739
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:29,909
something out false and reporting on it

740
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,380
in social media and then having the

741
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:33,210
mainstream media pick it up and then

742
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,710
saying well then citing the mainstream

743
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,700
media report well it must be true and

744
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,220
I'll show you an example here in a

745
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,169
minute okay so it's a lead-up pick a

746
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:43,650
divisive issue race relays and so forth

747
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:47,370
purchase purchase social media okay plan

748
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:49,260
it boost it push it to the extremes and

749
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,879
then organize protests okay back to the

750
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,860
freedom of assembly and then create

751
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,340
controversy to get media coverage that's

752
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:58,830
the game plan all right

753
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:00,899
23% of Americans in 2016 passed on a

754
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,250
story made up by the Russians completely

755
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:06,870
fake and we pass it on the thing and it

756
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:09,059
was real all right now you read the rest

757
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:10,559
of that try to move people to the

758
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:12,870
fringes push the right further the right

759
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:15,059
left further to the left you think the

760
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,659
idea is back to Judo and get to and all

761
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:17,460
that stuff

762
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,650
martial arts is you want to use the

763
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,270
opponent strength against you okay so if

764
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,620
a guy's taking a punch at you you just

765
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,809
want to step aside and take that arm and

766
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,219
keep pulling it okay take yet his

767
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:27,870
momentum and keep pulling them off guard

768
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,400
so you get the right and they all want

769
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,780
already want to go further right they're

770
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,669
watching fox news and stuff you want to

771
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,260
take them further to the right left you

772
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:35,490
want to take them if you're watching CNN

773
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,200
you want to take them further to left

774
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,090
and just get them to you you've heard

775
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,860
Americans never been as divided as we

776
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:42,209
are today it's cuz the Russians are back

777
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:48,240
here pushing us in that direction

778
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:52,049
alright so here's a real-world thing the

779
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,360
wraparound smear the news story was that

780
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:57,330
our CIA created the AIDS virus and

781
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:59,280
planted it to go against smaller

782
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:01,530
countries in Africa and so forth so they

783
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,928
planted that story called Operation

784
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:05,340
infection that the u.s. created the AIDS

785
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:06,119
virus and they planted it in six

786
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,399
different language

787
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:10,439
in different countries around the world

788
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,228
using Facebook Twitter all these

789
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,389
different things alright so if you have

790
00:31:13,229 --> 00:31:16,739
that story out in all these different

791
00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:19,349
areas do you think something's gonna

792
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:22,259
show me something pick it up yeah

793
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:23,609
some British Network Russian TV or

794
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:25,710
they're gonna tell them to pick it up

795
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:27,389
and then Russian TV picks it up al

796
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:29,190
Jazeera picks it up and once they start

797
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:31,529
reporting a British you know picks it up

798
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:33,389
and then the US CNN or Fox News picks it

799
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:36,119
up and then finally so I said why would

800
00:31:33,389 --> 00:31:37,139
CIA didn't start the AIDS virus but by

801
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:41,849
then it's already spread around the

802
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:43,949
world okay remember I told you to see

803
00:31:41,849 --> 00:31:49,979
this picture again how similar does that

804
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:52,739
look to that okay these are all okay

805
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:54,419
that's all the different ways Russia was

806
00:31:52,739 --> 00:31:56,249
pushing their propaganda inside the

807
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:58,409
United States what are they doing today

808
00:31:56,249 --> 00:32:01,320
they're pushing their propaganda through

809
00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:03,029
all these different it's not no

810
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,509
communist groups its Facebook Twitter

811
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:08,940
and so forth it's active some subversion

812
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:10,739
active aggressive subversion against the

813
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,719
United States using what would use it we

814
00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:14,519
created Facebook we created Twitter we

815
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:16,200
created Google all this stuff and

816
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:18,029
they're just using it against us just

817
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,639
taking our momentum and turn it against

818
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:28,320
us classic martial arts Putin trained

819
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:30,119
KGB tactics so they they actually have

820
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,320
algorithms and so forth set up so

821
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:33,478
anything that comes across the front

822
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,668
pages of paper if it hits enough papers

823
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:37,950
boom that's a that's a explosive issue

824
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:40,200
so Jeffrey Epstein Charlottesville

825
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:41,940
Ferguson San Bernardino no matter what

826
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,849
is and then they take it and they have

827
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,159
people sitting in laboratories in

828
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:49,439
buildings in st. Petersburg in Moscow

829
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:50,909
sitting there English speaking and they

830
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,219
sit there and they take that and how can

831
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:54,749
we spend you know Baltimore riots into

832
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:56,549
something that gets us go fight each

833
00:32:54,749 --> 00:32:58,830
other alright and then they push it back

834
00:32:56,549 --> 00:33:00,570
out and you are you are challenged it's

835
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:02,339
like somebody else might have a quota to

836
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:04,139
make so many phone calls to sell

837
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:06,089
insurance here you have to code it how

838
00:33:04,139 --> 00:33:09,209
many things can you push out on Facebook

839
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:10,889
how many likes how many how can you use

840
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:13,589
social media to push out these false

841
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:16,049
narratives that's what's going on now

842
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:17,519
it's not just Russia okay they've been

843
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:19,590
focused on we talked about them but

844
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,149
you've got China they're more interested

845
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:22,529
economics not necessarily change our

846
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:24,029
political structure they want us as a

847
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:26,549
trade partner okay

848
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:28,590
Iran you've got ideological problems you

849
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:30,269
got North Korea and their nutcase over

850
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:32,399
there they were pushing ransomware to

851
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:34,679
get money to fund their weapons of mass

852
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,959
destruction programs okay so there's a

853
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:39,059
lot of bad actors out there all right

854
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,360
I've talked about the Beijing Moscow

855
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:45,029
axis Russia's kind of defending the West

856
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,408
China is defending the East Russia has

857
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:48,179
really focused more on military

858
00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:50,700
interests they want to take us down from

859
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:52,830
a military perspective China wants to

860
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,139
come over in sylvari Connelly interests

861
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:57,029
some food for thought for you guys all

862
00:33:55,139 --> 00:33:59,309
right whose responsibility is it to

863
00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:00,659
regulate the Internet is that Facebook's

864
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:02,610
you know we've got called Mark

865
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:04,019
Zuckerberg in front of Congress to see

866
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:06,360
if he's going to do it self-imposed

867
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:09,359
regulation or should come get involved

868
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:11,159
okay and then what does that mean

869
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,589
what's the risk of regulation is ekhan

870
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:16,619
hamper Facebook Google and Twitter we

871
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:18,869
not get the next big advancement who

872
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:20,069
owns the data that's a big one that's a

873
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:23,429
real big one we'll talk about that a

874
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:25,139
second in free speech okay the tech

875
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:27,929
companies the US government the state's

876
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:30,240
each have their own piece of this is the

877
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:32,819
internet like the FTC is that is it a

878
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:35,129
like TV and radio and should be

879
00:34:32,819 --> 00:34:37,469
regulated what you can say and not or is

880
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:39,210
it more like a utility okay and should

881
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:40,348
be regulated like utilities those are

882
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,909
some of the questions we all have to

883
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:43,169
answer and you guys are in the best

884
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:46,260
position to be answering some of that

885
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:47,908
stuff all right you know whether we if

886
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,220
if they do certain regulation it's gone

887
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:53,010
hamper the next gaming that everybody

888
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:55,339
wants to to produce or the freedom of

889
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:58,200
speech is right now what you have is

890
00:34:55,339 --> 00:35:01,680
well we came with Jamie like pathetical

891
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:03,240
was behind that that's what really

892
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,118
prompted a lot of this because it was

893
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,430
used supposedly to help Trump's campaign

894
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:11,460
and so it's got the Democrats upset with

895
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:13,049
you know helping the Trump campaign you

896
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:16,050
get the Republicans upset that Facebook

897
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:18,210
is censoring the Conservatives judge Roy

898
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:20,250
Moore ran for Senate down in Alabama

899
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,900
Facebook was there's a lot of false

900
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:23,670
information out there and Facebook knew

901
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,650
it was false but they knew if they took

902
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:27,510
him down there would be more fuel for

903
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:28,829
the fire for the Conservatives say we

904
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:30,180
got a regular Facebook because they're

905
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:32,130
ahead tie conservative so he got this

906
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,390
battle going on all right here in the

907
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,490
United States

908
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,990
what it said Congress need stuff in it

909
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:38,308
you went ahead and got out in front of

910
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:40,019
it there was actually a case guy didn't

911
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:41,430
like hell the stuff that they had yeah

912
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:43,589
yeah they're on him so they sued and

913
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:46,769
went to the European courts and so forth

914
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:49,170
over there who owned your data in Europe

915
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:52,319
who owned your data you do the

916
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:54,269
individual over here who owns it the

917
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:56,609
company okay you tend to think of

918
00:35:54,269 --> 00:35:59,419
Americans and individuality and so forth

919
00:35:56,609 --> 00:36:02,339
rush power Europe's far ahead of us

920
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:05,130
California what's that yeah please

921
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:07,799
California has taken on the European

922
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:10,140
Standard the GDP our general data

923
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:11,700
protection regulation or whatever okay

924
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,589
and they've passed regulations very

925
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,118
similar to that and so it's going to be

926
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:16,650
supposedly coming into effect here in

927
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,539
the next year or two and when it does

928
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:22,079
now you've got one state in the United

929
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:23,849
States saying you own your data or they

930
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,789
have to take it down if you tell them to

931
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:28,500
do so and so what if California says you

932
00:36:26,789 --> 00:36:30,150
have 21 days Facebook to take it down

933
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,890
Minnesota comes and says you have 14

934
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,609
days and West Virginia comes in says you

935
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,650
have two days

936
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:36,598
how is Facebook ever gone survived

937
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,980
trying to figure out 50 no so it's time

938
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:40,289
for Congress to step in and figure it

939
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,609
out okay now we're back to that question

940
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:42,869
the Food for Thought question to what

941
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:44,910
extent should Congress being here

942
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:47,250
regulating the Internet and I hope you

943
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:51,089
guys can answer this a lot better sooner

944
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:52,049
and better than I can right now just in

945
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:53,910
the last month

946
00:36:52,049 --> 00:36:56,730
yeah Facebook coming out and Instagram

947
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:58,288
saying hey we're just a platform for

948
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,910
free speech that's what America is all

949
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:01,650
about freedom of speech First Amendment

950
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:02,970
okay so we're not gonna check it if

951
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,259
you're a politician you can put out

952
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,899
whatever light you want

953
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:08,250
Twitter says know who not so fast no

954
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,640
political ads okay

955
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:13,529
snapchat allows political attack then so

956
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,848
you start to see these social media

957
00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:16,970
companies starting to come out with

958
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:21,720
different standards depending on their

959
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:25,019
modeling and so forth so we've gone from

960
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,980
Russian meddling over - pushing America

961
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:27,779
to the fringes that's where this

962
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,059
meddling is occurring what is truth who

963
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:31,529
gets to decide is Mark Zuckerberg get to

964
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:33,930
decide what's truth and what stays up

965
00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:35,670
what comes down or to somebody else and

966
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:37,558
say it all leads us down here here to

967
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:40,019
the self media self regulation or

968
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:41,579
government regulation you guys have a

969
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:45,390
lot better perspective on that than I do

970
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:47,250
get involved with it conclusion you just

971
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,680
named elections critical infrastructure

972
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:51,990
for Russia and other bad actives actors

973
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,399
from that active aggressive subversion

974
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:55,890
that we talked about throughout this

975
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,540
presentation it's to stop us from

976
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:59,310
killing ourselves from within to

977
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:02,360
recognize that threat that's coming at

978
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:05,220
us and to do something about it

979
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,210
with that there's my contact information

980

I think you're always going to have that

987
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:43,759
spectrum okay across the American

988
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,960
Society but what I want to do is instead

989
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,970
of pushing people further out here

990
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,200
educate them and that's why I'm out in

991
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,669
all the high schools that I can get into

992
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,500
and giving this kind of presentations a

993
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,270
stop think before you link

994
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,710
don't let the Russians get inside your

995
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:56,270
network so first it is basic

996
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:58,850
cybersecurity again that you guys know

997
00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:01,040
very well double factor authentication

998
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:03,380
you know don't don't click on something

999
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:09,080
that you shouldn't don't drop your phone

1000
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:11,060
and break it yeah that's a so just be

1001
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,910
more aware of what's going on here's

1002
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:15,080
Google did this study themselves sixty

1003
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:16,730
percent of people believe the first

1004
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,650
thing they say so back to it stacey

1005
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:21,080
abrams i'm the first thing you see is

1006
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:23,210
communist you can come back and put for

1007
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,650
ten days of TV ads and social media it's

1008
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:26,630
in she is not a communist

1009
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:28,340
sixty percent still gonna plead because

1010
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,140
that was the power first impression and

1011
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,910
that's what the russians know that's why

1012
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,410
they could hack the ukraine election and

1013
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,700
just put it out they know they're gonna

1014
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:36,649
be found out but they knew it on the

1015
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,240
first impression people are gonna see

1016
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,130
that this nutcase

1017
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,330
you know this nationalist the way only

1018
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,320
had one percent vote they're gonna think

1019
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:44,210
that he actually had thirty seven

1020
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,500
percent votes so one we need these are

1021
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,480
taking them out or we need to get out

1022
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:50,210
and vote on our side that kind of thing

1023
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,380
so it's more just an education piece as

1024
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:55,960
to what we need to do to make people

1025
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:55,960
aware thanks so question over yes

1026
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:19,950
see they don't care they don't care what

1027
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:21,180
the truth is they just want to cause

1028
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,620
confusion they want to put out both

1029
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:47,160
sides of story that he did that he

1030
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:50,299
didn't all they want is confusion was

1031
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:54,569
our question they're just two statements

1032
00:40:50,300 --> 00:41:10,080
let me move back next question yes

1033
00:40:54,570 --> 00:41:11,850
please we are in a number of ways

1034
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,470
first I'm talked about the hava money

1035
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:16,470
the help America Vote Act money that

1036
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:18,149
came in we leveraged about six and a

1037
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:20,459
half million dollars that either we had

1038
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:23,100
or came in we did fifty-fifty with the

1039
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:26,490
the counties so some counties hardened

1040
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:29,220
their physical you know putting bars on

1041
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:31,470
windows they put cameras up to you know

1042
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:33,359
make it harder to get to get into the

1043
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:35,250
most of the money was spent for cyber

1044
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,780
security and cyber security training so

1045
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,730
twice now we've pulled all the courts

1046
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,900
together to train them about this and

1047
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:42,110
the first time we did it they probably

1048
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,890
thought that we're half nuts then

1049
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:46,080
Harrison County got hit with a

1050
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:47,759
ransomware attack now Wood County has

1051
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,290
been hit with ransomware attack they're

1052
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,500
been to other places in West Virginia

1053
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:54,810
that legend if they'd have been hit and

1054
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,400
so the clerk's now understand all maybe

1055
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:58,080
we've really started paying attention so

1056
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,540
they've all or were all getting them all

1057
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:04,920
to sign up for the EIS Act the election

1058
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:07,740
infrastructure a sack and so now here's

1059
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,330
a good thing the Department of Homeland

1060
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,310
Security actually printed posters for

1061
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:13,740
each one of our counties individual each

1062
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:15,390
55 counties and they are now hanging on

1063
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,770
the clerk's walls and if you go into any

1064
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:18,779
Kirk's offices I

1065
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:20,490
ask you to ask for it and it'll tell you

1066
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,620
if you have a cyberattack here's who you

1067
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:24,299
call if you have a national disaster

1068
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,650
here's who you call it the electricity

1069
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,390
goes out here so you call that kind of

1070
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:29,610
thing so we're training people to like a

1071
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:32,879
military operation continuing operations

1072
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:34,830
see right now if and we had this and a

1073
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,120
bridge goes down the tree falls crossed

1074
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:38,580
a bridge or a tree falls calls

1075
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,140
powerlines and reports are we can't vote

1076
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:42,000
at this precinct because the electricity

1077
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:44,370
out or we can't get to that precinct how

1078
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,320
do I know that that's not a Russian hack

1079
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:47,250
that's coming in or are false somebody

1080
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,230
just trying to mess with us

1081
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:51,240
so right now we've paired up with the

1082
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:53,640
fusion center and the fusion center here

1083
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,770
in West Virginia has 260 fusion liaison

1084
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,690
officers all over the state so I get a

1085
00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:00,120
call from Mingo County or I get an email

1086
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:01,920
says the the poles are down in a certain

1087
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:04,080
precinct in Mingo County and I call the

1088
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,060
Clark and I can't get the clerk I now

1089
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,220
have these resources these fusion hazel

1090
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:09,690
officers and I can call there's a lot of

1091
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,879
that kind of training and we actually

1092
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:13,530
have exercise tabletop exercises we go

1093
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,210
and work with the National Guard the

1094
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:17,460
National Guard's been wonderful we have

1095
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:21,060
a National Guard asset sitting in our

1096
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:23,250
office doing nothing but watching for

1097
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:24,870
the election security and so he reports

1098
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:26,250
to me on a weekly basis so there are a

1099
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:27,690
lot of different things going on it's

1100
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,920
like the duck that seems call on the

1101
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:29,580
outside and I'm the water he's paddling

1102
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,110
like hell

1103
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:34,640
we're paddle like helps try to stay

1104
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:34,640
ahead of it Thanks that question yes

1105
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,380
okay

1106
00:43:55,180 --> 00:44:03,618
yeah wait yeah yeah every ballot that is

1107
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,259
cast in West Virginia has a paper

1108
00:44:03,619 --> 00:44:09,079
verified voter verified paper trail

1109
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:10,910
so we can go back and if the machines if

1110
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:14,150
there's a miscount or a question about

1111
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:16,250
it we can go back and actually check and

1112
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:18,559
do a hand paper count we do do audits

1113
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:20,329
after each election all the machines are

1114
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:23,540
calibrated before and tested afterwards

1115
00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:25,760
to make sure so right now the Kentucky's

1116
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:28,130
best example next door the governor's

1117
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,650
race was decided by 5,000 votes very and

1118
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:32,210
the loser said see one of the biggest

1119
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:33,369
problems is the loser that won't concede

1120
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:35,930
defeat okay

1121
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:37,339
trumpet said he wasn't sure he was going

1122
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:38,598
to do it and then he gets elected and

1123
00:44:37,339 --> 00:44:41,240
then Hillary starts question in the

1124
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:43,280
election okay Stacy Abrams and Georgia

1125
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,779
still hasn't conceded defeat three years

1126
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,920
after the fact she's acknowledged that

1127
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:47,809
she thought the government but she

1128
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,970
hasn't conceded defeat there's a problem

1129
00:44:47,809 --> 00:44:51,920
with it at least down in Kentucky the

1130
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:54,770
governor did concede here just last day

1131
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,260
or so but when they did the recount not

1132
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:59,210
one vote was different okay so because

1133
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:01,220
of the current testing systems and so

1134
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:04,190
forth the audits and everything you can

1135
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:05,930
be very assured again my point was why

1136
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:07,849
would somebody go to the risk of hacking

1137
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:09,169
a machine to change one vote you're not

1138
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:10,880
going to change the outcome of elections

1139
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:13,160
changing one vote or even one precinct

1140
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,450
to change a special presidential you'd

1141
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,250
have to know what are the swing states

1142
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:17,868
what are the swing counties what is this

1143
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:19,670
point swing precincts and how many votes

1144
00:45:17,869 --> 00:45:20,960
do you have to change where you only

1145
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:23,030
change enough to win the election but

1146
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,849
not changed enough to get caught it's

1147
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:27,589
pretty way out there when you have all

1148
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:28,880
these other different means of not

1149
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:30,470
hacking election but changing the

1150
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,190
outcome of election by getting inside

1151
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,189
people's minds

1152
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:52,640
we do in fact we go from 14 that didn't

1153
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:54,200
have it last election to I think six are

1154
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,029
only six states that don't have at this

1155
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,970
time so forty four states will have

1156
00:45:56,030 --> 00:46:00,130
paper ballot backups yeah yeah the

1157
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:11,720
movement stealthy in that direction

1158
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:14,090
other questions please the hacks are

1159
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:16,399
enormous the attempted hacks but the

1160
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:16,850
penetrations are virtually not okay they

1161
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,820
got inside

1162
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:22,368
Illinois's database in 2016 that's what

1163
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:23,570
caused all this consternation okay then

1164
00:46:22,369 --> 00:46:25,010
there was something else that happened

1165
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:26,210
in the era of its own a database but we

1166
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:28,460
don't think it was Russians was

1167
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:30,770
something on the black market

1168
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:32,150
black Internet where they just

1169
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:34,100
penetrated but they didn't know anything

1170
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:35,630
with them didn't didn't sounder anything

1171
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:37,310
they didn't even change the Illinois

1172
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:40,550
they just got access to it but that

1173
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:42,740
scared everybody okay so they're not one

1174
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:45,050
vote was changed anywhere in America not

1175
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:46,310
one in this 2016 election so that

1176
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:49,490
answers the question about the actual

1177
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:51,890
hacking and outcome as far as this

1178
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:53,560
affecting the outcome that's gonna take

1179
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:56,359
psychologists you you would have to

1180
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,590
interviewed people that could have been

1181
00:46:56,359 --> 00:47:00,290
persuaded one way or the other

1182
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:02,420
okay beforehand then then had them

1183
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:04,490
actually get these memes and whatever

1184
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,720
and then see how they voted and then see

1185
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:07,069
if they had changed the outcome and it's

1186
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,140
so it's Justin the to dot different

1187
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:11,320
difficult to do category but there are

1188
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:14,180
people studying this Robert Epstein and

1189
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:16,369
and others now I've seen are showing

1190
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:18,890
that an interesting the Epstein is a

1191
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:20,990
Hillary or a Bill Clinton fan he has a

1192
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:23,920
picture of Bill Clinton on his wall he

1193
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:26,750
likes Bill Clinton in the Clinton so

1194
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,640
tends towards the left winner but he is

1195
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:30,470
saying that the algorithms that Facebook

1196
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,569
and Google are using are favoring the

1197
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:36,169
Democratic candidates so he's saying

1198
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:37,730
that Facebook Google Twitter are doing

1199
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:39,050
to the American electorate what the

1200
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:41,890
Russians are doing so if the Russians

1201
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:45,740
are favoring Trump Google is favoring

1202
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:47,600
Hillary or the Democrats so that's what

1203
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:48,859
I don't care which side it is we just

1204
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,390
need to educate the public that that's

1205
00:47:48,859 --> 00:47:51,740
what's going on and this is the main

1206
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:52,770
means that they're doing it so watch

1207
00:47:51,740 --> 00:48:03,270
what you believe

1208
00:47:52,770 --> 00:48:04,950
when it comes across this please yeah

1209
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:08,940
sure

1210
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:32,580
oh yeah that's going on all the time on

1211
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:34,230
paper yep it is and you guys all get

1212
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:36,000
this what is so egregious in this

1213
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:37,590
situation is that the Russians actually

1214
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,870
sent military operatives inside the

1215
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:41,910
United States 25 military operatives

1216
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:43,710
inside it was a psychological operation

1217
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:45,899
against the United States so it's at

1218
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:47,250
nation-state thing like what they did in

1219
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,810
Estonia now we're doing it here they're

1220
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:50,520
doing it maybe nothing's that's

1221
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:53,279
particularly egregious to us and

1222
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:55,500
elections just happens to be the focal

1223
00:48:53,280 --> 00:49:03,530
point because we're so divided in

1224
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:03,530
America oh yeah yeah yeah

1225
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:11,320
and what's Russia you have both the

1226
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,880
obvious open stuff that they want us to

1227
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:15,100
see and then you have the stuff that's

1228
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:18,610
secret stuff that's going on and we

1229
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:26,069
don't know I don't know what that is 300

1230
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:26,070
agencies know some of it yes okay

1231
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:31,470
hopefully I'll have two answers but I

1232
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:42,250
haven't but how do you know it's fake or

1233
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,529
not no I haven't what my point is up at

1234
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:45,430
Harvard we went through exercises that

1235
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:47,590
did just that

1236
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:48,879
the fake call would come in the email

1237
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:51,580
would come in or you would start getting

1238
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,700
goofy emails and you could from from

1239
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:55,930
clerks and so now I'm spending my time

1240
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:58,060
calling that clerk and if I can't reach

1241
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:59,169
them going how do I reach a clerk to

1242
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,940
find that whether it's real night so I'm

1243
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:02,740
wasting my time doing that not watching

1244
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:04,150
it's like magician you're watching the

1245
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:06,660
obvious stuff going on over here when

1246
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:09,160
they're picking your pocket over here

1247
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:10,690
we've been through it we've done it up

1248
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,339
there and then we brought it back here

1249
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:13,930
to the state to West Virginia and done

1250
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:16,410
it twice now with our clerks here in

1251
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:16,410
West Virginia

1252
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,219
[Music]

1253
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:54,050
yeah and that's why I'm getting out

1254
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,270
doing this now

1255
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:59,160
DHS shared just those five examples with

1256
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:02,220
me there's probably hundreds or whatever

1257
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,629
and it's just hell there are so many and

1258
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,950
that's what they do is they just push

1259
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,940
out whatever they can to see what sticks

1260
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:07,020
and then when they got something that's

1261
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,900
starting to get traction and then

1262
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:11,220
they'll push more and more and then so

1263
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,450
much this stuff is just basic military

1264
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,660
stuff how many of y'all were in the

1265
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:18,598
military when you're in the military I

1266
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:20,339
mean your plan you have to up one back

1267
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:21,900
okay you have to up so that their push

1268
00:52:20,339 --> 00:52:23,069
and push and pushing and when you get a

1269
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:25,140
breakthrough on this one that's where

1270
00:52:23,069 --> 00:52:27,750
you send the reserves in to go you know

1271
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:28,950
exploit that yeah that penetration of

1272
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,690
whatever that so they're just pushing

1273
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:32,339
stuff and with something sticks now

1274
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:33,869
they're gonna go ahead and start get a

1275
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:36,000
rally around it so there may be an

1276
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:37,950
organic person of peace activist or

1277
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,750
whatever or a legitimate person who

1278
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:41,160
either likes Hillary or likes Trump says

1279
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:43,410
I'm gonna have a little rally or

1280
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:45,299
whenever they get wind of it they hack

1281
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:47,190
into their account and here's some quick

1282
00:52:45,299 --> 00:52:48,780
numbers you'll may already be on top of

1283
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:50,940
this stuff but one of these

1284
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:52,589
presentations was given to us they said

1285
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:55,740
that if China is trying to get inside

1286
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:58,200
your system you have about four hours to

1287
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:59,598
figure it out North Korea you have about

1288
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,399
two hours and twenty minutes

1289
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,079
Russia you have about 19 minutes that's

1290
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,910
how good they are they decide they're

1291
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,859
gonna get inside your computer system

1292
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:09,779
they start hacking stuff once they get

1293
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:11,020
in they take it over your system in that

1294
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:12,700
quick of the time

1295
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:14,259
so and when you start talking with

1296
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,609
students and everything and that they

1297
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:17,080
can get inside your system and they can

1298
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:18,369
turn your camera on and see what you're

1299
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:20,350
seeing and turn your microphone on and

1300
00:53:18,369 --> 00:53:22,210
listen I mean already Google and is

1301
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:24,460
doing that like I said and so forth Siri

1302
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:26,560
with their cases now you know that where

1303
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:28,420
somebody gets murdered and their tribe

1304
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,160
the prosecutors trying to get Siri to

1305
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:31,960
turn over you know what they heard on

1306
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,640
that phone we're being listened to

1307
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,770
it's kind of scary stuff Big Brother's

1308
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:38,109
here but it's really scary when somebody

1309
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:40,420
directs it and says I'm coming after you

1310
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:42,340
I want to see what you're up to and they

1311
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,869
start penetrating you have 19 minutes if

1312
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,130
the Russians are on to you

1313
00:53:43,869 --> 00:53:46,390
that's why you don't want to click on

1314
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:50,680
the link that you don't know what it is

1315
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:52,509
and so forth other questions fact one

1316
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,520
it's something you'd ask there and you

1317
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:57,430
mentioned the weirdest one that I've

1318
00:53:54,520 --> 00:54:00,100
seen was North Dakota there was

1319
00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:01,960
something that said if you vote in North

1320
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:07,630
Dakota you will lose your hunting

1321
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:09,610
license well in there 1000 people stayed

1322
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:11,080
home we weren't the big turnout okay I

1323
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:13,270
mean that's know that's pretty

1324
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:15,250
sophisticated you know and why North

1325
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:16,660
Dakota you know if we sit here and think

1326
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:18,100
well we're not a big state don't worry

1327
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:20,470
about us the Russians were messing with

1328
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:22,029
North Dakota's election okay

1329
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:25,109
I'm sorry I've kennel somebody was there

1330
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:25,109
another question back there yeah

1331
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:58,000
yeah you've really hit on the crux of a

1332
00:54:55,510 --> 00:55:00,700
lot of this stuff where you trust

1333
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,280
technology go to the cloud and do that

1334
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:06,040
or does that centralize stuff where the

1335
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,510
one hack and you guys can be so

1336
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,400
sophisticated you don't have to change a

1337
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:10,690
whole lot of votes yeah out of 100 you

1338
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,250
only have to change two or three and a

1339
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:13,750
key precinct or whatever you change the

1340
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:15,310
outcome well election and who's gonna

1341
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:18,490
pick up this two or three votes or where

1342
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:20,560
so that's where I think right now at

1343
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:21,879
least I got 10 meetings twice a year

1344
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,350
with all the other secretaries across

1345
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,990
the United States and we compare notes

1346
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:27,370
and the key thing about this folks and

1347
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:29,709
the same thing I saw up at Harvard is

1348
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:31,410
it's not a Republican Democrat thing we

1349
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:33,550
all rise we're in this together okay

1350
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:34,779
it's a thing hacking the Republicans

1351
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:36,520
they can hack into the Democrats so

1352
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:39,010
forth so we all worked together on this

1353
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:41,020
and the short answer is we like our

1354
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:43,990
diversity we like some people three

1355
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:45,430
states vote-by-mail usin let you send

1356
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:48,009
your ballots up to the people in the

1357
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:49,930
mail Colorado Washington Oregon if we

1358
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:51,610
did that here in West Virginia you'd

1359
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:53,169
have pizza party soon bring your ballots

1360
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:54,730
on down here we'll phone out for you get

1361
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:56,710
free pizzas though I mean there's not a

1362
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:58,660
good history here in West Virginia with

1363
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:00,520
election security and so forth it just

1364
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:04,089
you so you have to work with the culture

1365
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:05,980
and that kind of thing so I trust

1366
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:08,350
technology to an extent but I always do

1367
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:11,140
a cost-benefit analysis is there enough

1368
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:12,610
risk doubt weigh the benefits and so I'm

1369
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,990
working with the military West

1370
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:16,240
Virginia's first state in the Union

1371
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:18,549
first ever tell people to vote on them

1372
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:20,799
on a mobile device but it's only the

1373
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:22,990
soldiers and the overseas people and

1374
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,940
that's because the soldiers turnout we

1375
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:27,310
were only getting 13% of active duty

1376
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:29,860
military votes counted the rest of

1377
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:32,170
America are usually 60% 65% something

1378
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:34,000
like that so why should soldiers only

1379
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:35,500
get 13% of their votes counted it's

1380
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,160
because they're out on missions they're

1381
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:40,810
out doing stuff and so to me the risk

1382
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,399
the the risk is something actually

1383
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:44,200
hacking this getting in and changing

1384
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:48,280
your vote here in West Virginia to set

1385
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:50,649
you at ease 998 ballots Stiles

1386
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,060
so right there across Elk River is a

1387
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:54,790
different ballad style than right here

1388
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:56,290
in Charleston we're so a Russian hacker

1389
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:58,240
is going to have to figure out what

1390
00:56:56,290 --> 00:57:00,400
people to put on the ballot knelt view

1391
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,529
versus you know here in Charleston where

1392
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,510
it's just too sophisticated too

1393
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:05,800
problematic to change one vote and then

1394
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:08,530
to get inside and try to hack the app

1395
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:10,240
inside the phone all within this period

1396
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:11,890
of time that somebody has downloaded and

1397
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,569
said I want to vote takes about ten

1398
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:15,339
minutes to do this and the Russians

1399
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:16,990
would have to be on to it inside there

1400
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:18,940
to change your vote so I think the

1401
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:21,160
likelihood of them hacking and changing

1402
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:26,340
vote is very small but the benefit is

1403
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:26,339
huge to our soldiers yes

1404
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:50,589
when do the polls close say it

1405
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:53,920
7 o'clock when do you want to know the

1406
00:57:50,589 --> 00:57:57,578
outcome of that election about 701 705

1407
00:57:53,920 --> 00:58:01,960
okay and so let's use technology to give

1408
00:57:57,579 --> 00:58:05,280
you what you want well we do that okay

1409
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:07,660
see and we got the it's already there

1410
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,730
that the seven and five results are not

1411
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:11,740
the real world the real results that's

1412
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:13,420
what we produce our secretary Thomas and

1413
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:14,979
it's about five six days later or

1414
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:16,510
whatever and we certify elections and so

1415
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:19,059
forth that's when the official vote

1416
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:20,980
can't come down but by automation

1417
00:58:19,059 --> 00:58:23,589
we give you what you want the press what

1418
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:25,900
it wants we get it out there but it's

1419
00:58:23,589 --> 00:58:27,940
not certified until we actually do it

1420
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,539
with the paper backup so we've done the

1421
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:31,619
audits

1422
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:35,619
okay we've gone back and if there's any

1423
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:37,089
deviancy deviation in the paper ballots

1424
00:58:35,619 --> 00:58:38,530
when we audit them then what the

1425
00:58:37,089 --> 00:58:41,200
electronic says then we're gonna go back

1426
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:43,990
and count them all by hand

1427
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:46,359
okay but typically there's no deviation

1428
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:47,799
and so those results saying that's just

1429
00:58:46,359 --> 00:59:03,430
what happened in Kentucky just happened

1430
00:58:47,799 --> 00:59:04,869
not one vote was changed yeah your hard

1431
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:08,169
questions for him asked me these he

1432
00:59:04,869 --> 00:59:20,980
would say the hard way he knows what

1433
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:23,829
he's talking about your all's world all

1434
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:25,059
right one last one anybody if not you

1435
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:26,829
