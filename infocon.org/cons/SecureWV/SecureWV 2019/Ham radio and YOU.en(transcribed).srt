1
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,209
welcome to Sunday morning have a

2
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:18,609
cybersecurity conference

3
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:24,488
glad to see so many bright eyed bushy

4
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:39,399
tailed fellow humans a few more piling

5
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:42,879
in close enough for government work this

6
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:45,929
is ham radio and you the original

7
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:49,780
intention was to do a couple minute

8
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:52,780
presentation using all of 1950s and 40s

9
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:56,109
informational you know the scratchy

10
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:59,440
videos that didn't work out so you got

11
00:00:56,109 --> 00:01:02,409
me instead my name is Brandon canoe

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,628
amateur radio call sign ke a KNX that's

13
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:07,900
not anything clever it's a randomly

14
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:09,400
assigned by the FCC the person before me

15
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,280
got ke a K&Y

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,420
and then if you put your mind to it you

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:18,790
can figure out who got the callsign

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:20,890
after me when is ham radio I first off

19
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,200
the term ham is a pejorative term used

20
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:25,690
in professional wired telegraphy since

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,790
the 19th century to not cooperated with

22
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:32,770
poor Morse code sending skills and their

23
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:36,400
ham-fisted wired telegraphy Telegraph's

24
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:39,220
predates wireless and there weren't too

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,460
many amateur wired Morse code operators

26
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:45,100
so one side the wireless scene kind of

27
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,860
took off than the the pros didn't like

28
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:51,580
the newbies as often goes with anything

29
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:53,320
tech the official definition of amateur

30
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,330
radio is the use of radio frequency

31
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,029
spectrum for purposes of non-commercial

32
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,110
exchange of messages while

33
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,300
experimentation self-training part of

34
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,730
the recreation Radio sport con testing

35
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:08,550
and emergency communication or dig into

36
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:11,039
some more of those first off what is a

37
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:14,110
non-commercial amateur radio is not

38
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,450
terrestrial and Trish you're already on

39
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,760
television so I we pick up your car on

40
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,250
your TV anybody still has an antenna

41
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,560
further TV anybody show of hands

42
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,840
those few look at that HD

43
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,330
the HD is uncompressed and looks a lot

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,520
better you can really see a difference I

45
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:33,520
say that service services of about any

46
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,170
kind of there are some satellite

47
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,870
repeaters for amateur radio which is

48
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:40,238
pretty nifty to play around with

49
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,830
business to aid communication like cabs

50
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,860
tow trucks those all have separate

51
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:48,300
licenses from their FCC and your cell

52
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,709
phones they are ultra high frequency

53
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,550
transceivers but on a separate FCC

54
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:58,890
license as well

55
00:02:51,550 --> 00:03:02,430
I was experimentation this is a map of

56
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:06,220
an application called whisper it's a

57
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,570
good network of amateur radio operators

58
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,480
connecting their radios to their

59
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,940
computers and operating at low power if

60
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,880
you can see this is a map of a station

61
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,530
in Europe and I don't know which

62
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,660
frequency they're listening on but

63
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:23,800
basically all of this frequency other

64
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:26,590
stations have within a two-minute window

65
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,079
and they've taken turns broadcasting and

66
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,090
then listening and this station in

67
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:33,400
Europe can hear all these stations from

68
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:36,040
all around the world on our low power

69
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,540
digital transmission so it's it's

70
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,820
interesting to watch where your

71
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,220
transmissions go and well you can pick

72
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:45,489
up other stations transmissions and it

73
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:48,010
tells you where they are the bands may

74
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:49,060
be open or whether it's good propagation

75
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:54,399
on if you wanted to make some

76
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:57,670
long-distance contacts computer modeling

77
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,480
this is a basic is the starting screen

78
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:03,369
for an antenna modeling software this

79
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,350
has made things a lot easier before the

80
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,290
days of just shattering things together

81
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,120
and using math and hoping to get

82
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,929
something out in here you can design new

83
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,000
antennas test out an antenna in your own

84
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,880
you know backyard or the world where you

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,310
plan on on setting up so you get a

86
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,960
decent idea of how well your antenna is

87
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,050
going to perform before you actually put

88
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,739
it together this one this program was

89
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,960
used to build on one of the more popular

90
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,190
multi band

91
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,409
antennas that was originally designed

92
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,120
for one

93
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,340
one specific frequency but it was

94
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,620
discovered that it works decently well

95
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,750
and others and this software was used to

96
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,120
improve on that one and make a true

97
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,620
multiband antenna and then there's fee

98
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,180
articles out there where people abused

99
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,480
this software to improve on it even

100
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:54,690
further so people are always tinkering

101
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:56,700
most of the things open-source this is a

102
00:04:54,690 --> 00:05:00,750
free software there are paid sellers as

103
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:02,700
with about anything else although

104
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,620
there's always the Sappho is called FL

105
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:09,240
digi it's available for about any

106
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,770
operating system Windows Linux Mac if

107
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,520
you got something weird then no probably

108
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:21,240
can't help you with that and people are

109
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:22,200
still using Morse code five points to

110
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,019
whoever can decipher though

111
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,019
[Music]

112
00:05:28,499 --> 00:05:35,499
nothing that was secure WV and in Morse

113
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,779
code that was done using our this I'm

114
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:41,409
sorry that that antenna software was

115
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:44,379
called out for NEC this is FA bidi this

116
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:46,569
is a digital node interaction with your

117
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:48,759
computer this is just a screenshot of

118
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:51,370
something random I found my mind but I

119
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,680
did build that you can create Morse code

120
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,879
on the software and a broadcaster that

121
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,279
way if you don't want to learn how to

122
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,499
pop it out yourself you can also listen

123
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,529
as well you can tune into a frequency

124
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:06,249
plug your radio into your computer and

125
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:08,219
it will stay out Morse code that diverts

126
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:09,969
and got some pretty interesting

127
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:12,539
conversations from all over the world

128
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:16,479
just spell out just on receive mode and

129
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:18,128
our radio teletype is also still around

130
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:22,180
if anybody remembers the old newsreels

131
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:25,360
with the tickers in the back there are

132
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:28,539
some hardcore amateur radio operators to

133
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,629
still use that old hardware but it's all

134
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:37,688
done on computers now radioteletype

135
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:40,719
already is is still fairly popular cell

136
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:44,680
training if you want to get into amateur

137
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:48,879
radio there are cram sessions that's

138
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,610
where a club or an organization somebody

139
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:54,279
they read through every question and the

140
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,809
FCC test Bank several times and then

141
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,808
take the test immediately after since

142
00:06:55,809 --> 00:07:03,009
the questions do all public do that at

143
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:04,360
the club function that's mostly a kind

144
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:06,969
of a loner activity unless you really

145
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,459
try hard to be around other people you

146
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:10,959
can get training or tests that's what a

147
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:12,909
ham fest it's kinda like a convention

148
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:16,059
for amateur radio to do a lot of buying

149
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:19,808
and selling a few classes and testing

150
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:21,159
there you can tune in on some of the

151
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:23,409
frequent what's called nets those are

152
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:25,479
just meetings on the air they're still

153
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,980
good I go on locally and some of the

154
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,409
lower frequency

155
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,790
they originally or even even worldwide

156
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,160
you can get all the tips and information

157
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,870
from those once you're once you're able

158
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,500
to transmit it better than anybody can

159
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:40,330
can listen if you have the equipment

160
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:44,050
club gatherings they're another local

161
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:47,080
club they took over a one of the one of

162
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:50,020
the picnic areas a Coonskin over the

163
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,200
summer and we're just having you know an

164
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,940
open radio radio day they had antennas

165
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,670
all over all over the trees they were

166
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:00,580
making contacts all over the world and

167
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:03,430
anybody could come and our gym being in

168
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,530
the air it's a weekend where you know

169
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,380
the entire world kind of gets together

170
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:10,299
and tries to make contacts it's not

171
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,120
really a contest but it's just a way to

172
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:15,310
I guess kind of introduce more people to

173
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,320
amateur radio Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts

174
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,630
get involved with that quite a bit

175
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,130
especially in this area I know my my Cub

176
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:26,409
Scout group has gone to the Jamboree on

177
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:29,230
the air by the Recreation this is not my

178
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:31,840
station I don't know who evidence photos

179
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:33,820
over there but another random picture

180
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,709
plucked from the internet but this is a

181
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:41,710
basic fairly advanced ham Shack or

182
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:44,140
amateur radio station I see a microphone

183
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:46,360
computer screens amplifiers transceivers

184
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,210
all kinds of stuff yours can be as

185
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,370
complicated as this or as basic as just

186
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:54,250
a radio in a corner of the room you know

187
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:56,260
it's really up to you that it gives you

188
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,540
opportunity to experiment with with

189
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,800
different technologies or even invent

190
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,589
new ones that happens all the time

191
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:06,370
people are using our by the Raspberry Pi

192
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:09,310
has been very very beneficial to the

193
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:14,110
amateur radio community somebody figured

194
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:16,089
out that they can transmit and the very

195
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,690
high frequency range on one of the pins

196
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:22,360
so they're turning that into a

197
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:24,970
self-contained amateur radio transceiver

198
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,250
just off the Raspberry Pi now without

199
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,750
that there's an amplifiers it won't get

200
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,550
much further than this room but that's

201
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:34,360
just one of the things that that hams

202
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:36,069
discovered and another thing is making

203
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,520
global contacts with with basic

204
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:43,120
equipment you know the proper gear

205
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:46,089
which is you radiofrequency bouncing

206
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,430
around within the atmosphere using basic

207
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:50,170
equipment like that you can really reach

208
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,000
over the horizon in two different

209
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,910
countries different regions even you

210
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,830
know different continents seen it on

211
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,870
YouTube haven't really done it myself

212
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:01,089
yet but I've only been in this a couple

213
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,950
years even some of the guys I've done it

214
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:07,330
for thirty years are still experimenting

215
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:09,040
and trying trying new things radio

216
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,820
spirit is kind of the physical

217
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,069
activities associated with amateur radio

218
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,190
radio direction-finding or protocol

219
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,020
foxhunting will have a transmitter

220
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:23,290
somewhere on the woods urban environment

221
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:26,470
and you'll use your radio skills and

222
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:29,079
equipment to kind of find it sing it on

223
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:31,089
the air that is a competition the way

224
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,130
you try to make contacts from certain

225
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:35,380
you know mountain or hilltop peaks

226
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:37,330
within within a region you know you've

227
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,330
gone to X Mountain here or make a

228
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:42,580
contact on to the next mountain it's

229
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:45,490
more active so not although amateur

230
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,410
radio operators look like me D

231
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,770
expeditions these are really interesting

232
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:52,870
this is where this is a picture of it's

233
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:55,270
a tropical location they set up

234
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:57,399
fiberglass antennas with wires all over

235
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:00,399
the place and then they contacts from

236
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:03,100
there if anybody is you know interested

237
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,579
and and travel to unique locations I

238
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:09,579
know the Apsaras amateur radio is

239
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:12,989
concerned the the wave is kind of spread

240
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:15,910
out in regions goods unique islands

241
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:18,370
unique places to to make contacts from

242
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:21,069
or to so if somebody tries to whatever

243
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:25,209
we're motile and this is and I'm

244
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:27,550
guessing South Pacific probably then you

245
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:29,649
may or may not have that checked off on

246
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,449
your list or append on your map or have

247
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:33,610
a postcard from there so it's one of the

248
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:37,320
it's one of the days is that people try

249
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:39,820
to put together these distance

250
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,709
expeditions to to kind of make those

251
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,930
contacts or have fun for themselves and

252
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:49,180
to you know provide pens on the map for

253
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:52,270
other people the access that is produced

254
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,760
at a distance exchange excuse me on all

255
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:56,550
manner of frequencies transmission modes

256
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,740
power those locations

257
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:03,040
resume estar is a contest going on at

258
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:06,400
some point using high frequency very

259
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:10,329
high frequencies and digital modes voice

260
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:13,540
Morse code only or a CW continuous wave

261
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:16,599
you'll hear it called that no power no

262
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:19,569
power limits at all you know some of the

263
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,270
higher power stations in a region with

264
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:24,640
with amplifiers and really expensive

265
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:29,020
antennas can can kind of knock out any

266
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:31,569
other signals that there's something you

267
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,040
got to deal with then the different

268
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,680
operations that can mentioned are the D

269
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:41,290
expeditions to others you know there's a

270
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:44,649
big I guess desire to have contacts from

271
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:46,899
the Vatican and some strange Island and

272
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:50,320
and the Mediterranean office Sicily

273
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:52,360
there's a amateur radio station there

274
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,060
but they only had so many people in per

275
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,399
year to use it so if somebody goes there

276
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,079
they're putting all over message boards

277
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,000
and whatnot so people can be listening

278
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:04,180
at tuning their antennas when you get a

279
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,160
contact or a qso post card from from

280
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:10,779
that location and are most of the

281
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,540
communication is one of the biggest

282
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:16,029
reasons somebody might get involved in

283
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,620
amateur radio either just to participate

284
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,990
themselves or in some of the

285
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:24,130
organizations the amateur radio

286
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:26,020
emergency service or Aries is a we're

287
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,360
out of ham radio emergency communication

288
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,430
organization that's put together by

289
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,550
amateur radio operators it's all

290
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:35,949
volunteer base I'm not aware of any

291
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,020
I guess professional paid positions

292
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:43,329
within that it's all I guess a volunteer

293
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:45,579
based either made up at any time of the

294
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:48,750
month they have regular net stab drills

295
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:50,439
you know practice to communicate from

296
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,050
different locations in different

297
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,060
situations

298
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:56,520
radio amateur service in an emergency

299
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,859
service or races is

300
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:03,390
organized and managed by FEMA Federal

301
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:05,520
Emergency Management Agency that is just

302
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:07,439
an interface between the amateur radio

303
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,350
operators and the federal government are

304
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,060
very similar on the amateur radio side

305
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,810
it's all volunteer base to have regular

306
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:18,029
meetings nets or you know groups on the

307
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:21,149
air drills activities that kind of thing

308
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:23,339
one that I'm not very familiar with is

309
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:23,760
the military Auxiliary radio system or

310
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:27,420
Mars

311
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:30,000
that's innovate interface between the US

312
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,699
military and amateur radio which is

313
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,610
different you know from the federal

314
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,230
government well similar recently the

315
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,730
Navy dropped to this program they just

316
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,750
didn't feel it was necessary but the

317
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:44,040
army the Air Force still have all Mary's

318
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:46,140
Marsh set up something I've been reading

319
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,599
into lately him yes I'm working my way

320
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:52,080
down the list as in the practical

321
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:55,200
examples of emergency communication in

322
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:58,410
the September 11 2001 attacks the the

323
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:02,100
main repeater for most of the first

324
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:03,870
responders fire police EMS webs on the

325
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,060
North Tower so when I went down

326
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:08,250
communication went down I learned my

327
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,779
co-workers was living in New York at the

328
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,700
time and he was telling me about that

329
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:17,070
amateur radio operators going around

330
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:18,959
with police officers fire trucks and you

331
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:21,000
know amateur repeater stations set up

332
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,939
and locations where I was needed to keep

333
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:29,310
communication up and running and such a

334
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:31,130
disaster other other examples were out

335
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:33,689
there Hurricane Katrina

336
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:35,790
earthquake in China and the Boston

337
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:38,970
Marathon bombing and Boston the

338
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:42,300
communications that were just unprepared

339
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:45,560
for such a you know with everything else

340
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:47,339
going on with the marathon itself I the

341
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,369
communications were overwhelmed and

342
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:53,940
amateurs stepped in to kind of help out

343
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:58,380
as they could it's kind of a visual

344
00:15:53,940 --> 00:16:01,440
example of RIT amateur radio is you can

345
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:04,200
see this is a dipole antenna or two

346
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,779
poles positive-negative you can see this

347
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,870
is the radio frequency interacting with

348
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:13,959
the wire of this simple and

349
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:14,500
changing the polarity up and down left

350
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:16,060
and right

351
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,320
I'm not electrical engineer somebody

352
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,649
else smarter than make it explain that

353
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:23,230
much better than I could but this kind

354
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:26,800
of explains how the radio waves

355
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:31,410
emanating from one antenna will interact

356
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:34,709
with another one hears via the same

357
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:39,579
antenna but from the top transmitting

358
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:43,119
radio radiates out from your antenna and

359
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:45,519
kind of is out like a doughnut pattern I

360
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:51,279
hope this is just a top of you and a

361
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:54,640
slice a sauce of that so antenna

362
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:57,610
modeling and placement could be its own

363
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,290
its own course for days and days and

364
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,089
days that's something that's still being

365
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,649
experimented with even though while this

366
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:06,520
has been around for over a hundred years

367
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:09,010
the other things you want to look for is

368
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,780
that you know critical angle to where if

369
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,030
you you're interested in long distance

370
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,668
contacts you'll want your radio waves to

371
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:17,589
go out towards the horizon so I mean if

372
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:19,510
it smacked right into a mountain and you

373
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:23,379
haven't you know want to reposition your

374
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:27,010
your antenna but if you you know curious

375
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:29,679
wet radio frequencies or what Pam lady

376
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:33,790
are actually you know physically does in

377
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:37,900
our power well this is an example of of

378
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:39,790
houses electrum attic magnetic energy

379
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,510
interacts with an antenna and how its

380
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:48,940
transmitted from an antenna something I

381
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:51,100
found useful now within the amateur

382
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:54,610
really within the radio spectrum these

383
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:57,070
are the frequencies allocated to amateur

384
00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:00,399
radio if you hear somebody say that two

385
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:03,460
meter band twenty minute band as these

386
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,400
portions here a regular spectrum that's

387
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,429
been allocated to amateur radio so if

388
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,870
somebody says two meters that's in a

389
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:13,630
very high frequency it's this section

390
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:16,989
here to this section there these all day

391
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:19,570
you know that together directly there's

392
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:22,179
there's other services almost all the

393
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,050
way radio frequency spectrum is taken

394
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:25,690
out bar

395
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:28,240
something there's very little from you

396
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,990
know any the lower end to the higher end

397
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,670
of useful radio frequency that's not set

398
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,220
aside for somebody but usually that is

399
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:38,950
when amateur radio has I was calling

400
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:43,240
here is mostly relegated to very high

401
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:47,740
frequency six meters and ten meters they

402
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:51,070
are actually I could do when you say six

403
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:55,540
ten two meters that is the distance

404
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:57,460
between these two data lines here as

405
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:00,100
they're the wavelength that is the

406
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:04,390
alternating current changing from

407
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:09,070
positive to a negative current in the

408
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:10,810
air that's not easier than saying you

409
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:14,710
know the twenty one megahertz to twenty

410
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:17,440
four megahertz section of the frequency

411
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:20,470
you say fifteen ten meter manual one of

412
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:24,400
the things you learn as education goes

413
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:26,710
along there's just a visual

414
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,840
representation of what the FCC the

415
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:31,230
licensing agency in the United States

416
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:36,699
has allocated to amateur radio operators

417
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:40,110
in the United States our so said they

418
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:44,520
don't really bet together a CB radio

419
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:47,229
citizens band that's in the 11 meter

420
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:51,970
space so that's right about ten meters

421
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:54,460
and that between six and ten is the

422
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:57,780
variation between high frequency and

423
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:01,240
very high frequency that they're both

424
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:04,690
can kind of operate as high frequency

425
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,900
and very high frequency characteristics

426
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:10,410
tend to do which is a propagation over

427
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:14,440
the over the horizon communication

428
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:15,970
sometimes ten and six meters can if the

429
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,090
atmospheric conditions are I can

430
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:20,590
propagate over the horizon bounce around

431
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,820
within the atmosphere a few times you

432
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:25,350
can make some really long distance

433
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:27,970
contacts excuse me

434
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:31,330
that's why the caller six meters is one

435
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:32,950
of the failure than a fairly recently

436
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,689
allocated to amateur radios it's been

437
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:36,820
called a magic band because it can't

438
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:39,280
operate as

439
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:44,800
high frequency characteristics as far as

440
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:47,410
propagation goes why would you ham radio

441
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,530
good food geeks I was not aware that

442
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:52,450
turnips involved you know whether you're

443
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:55,030
you know buying your equipment testing

444
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,570
out for somebody else or yourself just

445
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:59,830
experimenting with new technology

446
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:02,649
building kits from the ground up it's

447
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:04,960
shattering and experimenting with new

448
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:08,280
technologies whether using you know

449
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,410
brand new top-of-the-line equipment or

450
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,810
buying junk from ebay or using long

451
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:15,760
since absolutely equipment such as that

452
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:18,010
I mentioned earlier the the original

453
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,480
radio teletype equipment that's that's

454
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:23,050
still out there people can find it they

455
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:25,690
will fix it and use it to print out a

456
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:30,780
little ticker tape of a regular child

457
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:35,980
transmission in 2019 and some of the the

458
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:38,379
original amateur radio kits or stations

459
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,940
using vacuum tubes as amplifiers those

460
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,480
are still around I have two of them

461
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:46,300
myself I'm trying to revive but it's a

462
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:49,480
struggle sometimes there's no something

463
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,680
for everyone I've hear the computers

464
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,140
which if you have this conference you

465
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,540
probably were there mention earlier the

466
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:58,180
digital modes like whisper weak signal

467
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,800
propagation reporter that's all digital

468
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:04,660
is all done over their computers it's

469
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:07,120
automated that it's a peace integration

470
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,090
with your your radio but they're using

471
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,340
similar technologies you have their

472
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,949
keyboard to keyboard contacts so you

473
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,750
type it in or it modulates it into an

474
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:19,030
analog sound and then the other station

475
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,620
picks it up almost so God you know a lot

476
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:23,830
of us in chat room if anybody remembers

477
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:29,020
those I was still around it's been

478
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:30,790
awhile and sooner so this can even be a

479
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,200
totally controlled with your computer so

480
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,720
you're not fiddling with knobs switches

481
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,160
anything it integrates that into your

482
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,410
into your computer so you've set out

483
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:42,000
your all your parameters from your mouse

484
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:45,710
and keyboard and then fire and forget I

485
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,200
did the proper

486
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:50,960
equipment and antennas and and all that

487
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,310
you can pick up transmissions from the

488
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,420
other satellites you know uncompressed

489
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:58,600
beautiful pictures of the earth from

490
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:01,190
weather satellites you can pick up

491
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:04,699
information from NASA or the probes that

492
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:08,780
are out within the solar system and even

493
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:10,640
recently beyond they are using radio

494
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:13,070
frequency to communicate back to the

495
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,700
earth with the right equipment you can

496
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:19,550
pick up and and look at that information

497
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:22,960
it's pretty interesting and if you are

498
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:27,139
you know more of a you know an alien

499
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:30,080
person Isis fits in with their the theme

500
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:32,470
of this year that anything that the

501
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,760
search for extraterrestrial intelligence

502
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,920
network is picking up you can find too

503
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,379
so anything that you can contribute and

504
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,990
submit to their organization amateur

505
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:47,210
radio operators do participate with the

506
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:49,130
SETI Network if your competitor Mitchel

507
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,680
Arizona style as a contest running

508
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:55,010
whether you're filling in a grid map of

509
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,990
the United States using VHF only I mean

510
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,590
trying to contact California from West

511
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:02,120
Virginia using very high frequency is a

512
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:04,399
very interesting challenge but with the

513
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:07,250
right atmosphere conditions it can be

514
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:12,770
done well you know in our international

515
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:16,220
contacts I've seen on YouTube a you know

516
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:17,990
young man contact South Africa from FLIR

517
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,580
they're using five watts if you're

518
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:23,080
familiar with electronics that's not

519
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:26,050
very much juice at all and I was using a

520
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,879
voice which takes up about the most

521
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:31,730
bandwidth of the frequency you know

522
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,720
these digital modes and and Morse code

523
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:38,600
or just tiny little slivers within the

524
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,880
within the wavelength that you know

525
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,280
using blue AC to train on five watts to

526
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,250
get a couple thousand miles over the

527
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,810
ocean that's you know it's impressive

528
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:51,020
right place right time right atmospheric

529
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:53,510
conditions propagation is its own study

530
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:55,100
that's constantly being experimented

531
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,600
with it could be its own class but

532
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,060
almost any of these thoughts could be

533
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,909
there

534
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,429
it's just a high-level introductory so

535
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:06,600
if you want to do more details then

536
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:08,370
you're in the wrong talk there magazine

537
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,980
est and a couple up here if anybody's

538
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,719
interested passing through that monthly

539
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:16,500
is I think it's the best place to rest

540
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,030
contacts or contests excuse me because

541
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,370
they were right now rested and the

542
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:22,740
different frequencies the times the the

543
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:27,929
modes anything to do with the contest

544
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:31,200
are all and and in that magazine emerges

545
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:33,570
easily we've discovered in other when do

546
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,340
ratio superstorm sandy all the other

547
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:36,300
wonderful things that have hit our state

548
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,540
in the last few years

549
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:41,820
satires run reliable even if they play

550
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,649
that the generator to one of the more

551
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,830
popular ones I mean you're like you to

552
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:49,860
get you might have a good signal but you

553
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:51,179
you won't have regular internet

554
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,899
connection you might have trouble

555
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:57,150
getting a telephone call out but other

556
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:00,750
amateur radio repeaters always around

557
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:02,100
and you I mean if you contact them

558
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,330
somebody else in the Our Lady as long as

559
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,070
your battery's charged there's no

560
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:07,020
infrastructure there so we have an

561
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:10,200
emergency those there's always somebody

562
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,820
listening so as we learn that the past

563
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,660
week and Internet infrastructure is

564
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:17,220
vulnerable so I mean if the air goes out

565
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,740
for your entire organization or your

566
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:22,550
house or any of the hardware associated

567
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,510
with with the internet is taken down for

568
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:28,020
whatever it is and rather than a failure

569
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:30,750
so we you know act of God then with

570
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:33,480
those that radios and the planet

571
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:35,400
telephone service which was thought to

572
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,530
be more rather than you know the you

573
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,410
know cable and the other services that's

574
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:42,330
its uses declining even that gets you

575
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:45,300
know power directly from from the phone

576
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:47,460
company its uses declining so it's not

577
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:51,389
as as reliable as it once was and that

578
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:53,700
continues to go down there is ham radio

579
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,680
Henry those over there are groups of

580
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,930
like-minded individuals other similar

581
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,620
hams associated with the group in this

582
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:01,380
conference

583
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:07,290
I'm looking at three four just in this

584
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:09,150
room so I mean your report

585
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:11,220
amateur radio operator is about anyway

586
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:13,350
you go we tend to find find each other

587
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,180
especially if you got one of these

588
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,830
hooked to your boat I mean we're pointed

589
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:20,550
out and talk and trigger signs and

590
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:20,990
frequencies just have fun that's what we

591
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,010
do

592
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:25,620
you'd be hard-pressed to find a true

593
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:27,420
survivalist or outdoorsman doomsday

594
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,969
prepper that have you without at least a

595
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:32,400
handheld transceiver something like this

596
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,290
handheld transceiver HT there's a lot of

597
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,450
acronyms so if I use an acronym some of

598
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:37,830
those and understand please stop me as

599
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:41,820
if there's any questions or comments or

600
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:43,800
anything just shout I don't mind I you

601
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,149
know even if you're not transmitting

602
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,440
because you're afraid of radio

603
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:49,380
direction-finding you're really

604
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,680
listening because the other agencies

605
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,150
might be after you you ever know I was

606
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,010
transmitted outside of amateur radio

607
00:27:54,150 --> 00:28:04,050
bands so I went for the FCC to kick down

608
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:05,940
the door any day now they're watching so

609
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:08,700
I put a fake name on the sign outside

610
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,290
that's not true I noticed our veterans

611
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,630
use radio at some point they know the

612
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:15,350
communication is key that's actually

613
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:19,170
that got me interested in amateur radio

614
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:21,360
high frequency propagation over the

615
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:25,050
horizon communication to digital modes I

616
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:29,550
was a crew chief on Hawk helicopters and

617
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:31,050
we had a basic but very reliable high

618
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:33,060
frequency system where we could

619
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:35,550
automatically report GPS coordinates

620
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:39,389
over high frequency you know over

621
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:41,490
horizon without any it was every every

622
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:44,550
seven minutes it would broadcast out our

623
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:47,280
position in our our station back at the

624
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:49,169
at the flagpole code could hear the area

625
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,240
area of satellites could pick it up and

626
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:53,070
tell our position all over the world

627
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,350
with it was completely automated and

628
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:57,659
they rely us and completely encrypted

629
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:59,689
useless to anybody else listening but

630
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:02,970
that's what really got me interested in

631
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:05,490
so you know a lot of veterans either

632
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:08,100
lived around his singles or territory

633
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:13,710
Aki talkie or summer so most of us are

634
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:16,949
familiar with with radios conferences

635
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:19,490
there's almost as I am talking somewhere

636
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:21,510
hosting testing after this this talk

637
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:25,020
somewhere I'm not sure we're in one of

638
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:26,610
the rooms I imagine up here so hang

639
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:30,590
around if you're interested in testing

640
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:33,330
and there's those talks on amateur radio

641
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:35,039
at some of these conferences I've seen I

642
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:37,020
went to ham radio for hackers at

643
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,490
derbycon last year I don't think they

644
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,010
had much for ham radio this year not

645
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:42,799
that I saw and think so I should've put

646
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:45,299
in my CFP I didn't think I would I

647
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:48,120
always put in your CFP let him tell you

648
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:50,580
now I'm on forums

649
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:54,449
I've learned have been a great resource

650
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:55,860
for amateur radio qiz that met I found

651
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,020
in some parts I've been scouring the

652
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,850
internet for from our radio and I just

653
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:02,639
had to go in there and do a search and

654
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:05,699
found it some of the amateur radio

655
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,980
operators are getting along in their

656
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:12,210
years so they may not be familiar with

657
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:14,220
the Facebook or or the other services

658
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,750
that that some of the younger guys might

659
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,240
be using so they have to do a little

660
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,130
digging Facebook groups locally

661
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,510
regionally worldwide those there's the

662
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:24,000
Facebook group for just about anything

663
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:25,529
associated with amateur radio and our

664
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,250
slot channels anybody you slack for

665
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:30,450
anything it's pretty interesting group

666
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,929
North America hams I founded from

667
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,789
derbycon

668
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:34,860
it's run by an amateur radio operator

669
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:38,279
out of Canada but there's a lot of good

670
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:39,750
good information in there there is an

671
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:41,880
article I read available that has

672
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:45,419
somebody sent Bitcoin from Canada to

673
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,770
California over amateur radio so I

674
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:48,899
posted that in that groove and there was

675
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:50,580
again I was asked so they detail him on

676
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:52,110
how it was done so I thought that was

677
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,210
just fascinating you know sending

678
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:57,590
encrypted currency from one country to

679
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:59,970
another without infrastructure you know

680
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:01,320
that's where than the various things

681
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:06,260
could you do you know it gets them kids

682
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,260
to mind spending that nice amateur radio

683
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:11,700
local clubs host tests hosts are testing

684
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,520
and allow one of the local clubs here

685
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,929
late on my technician license they test

686
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:19,250
every first Friday of every month

687
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:21,659
whether there's one person or 20 and

688
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,710
conferences host testing we're hosting

689
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:24,960
the technician tests

690
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:27,179
shortly after this this talk I got my

691
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,880
general license at derbycon

692
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:31,830
it's just it's something I associate

693
00:31:29,880 --> 00:32:09,320
about a geek so there's almost always a

694
00:31:31,830 --> 00:32:09,320
test somewhere yes yeah 15 bucks

695
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:20,199
Saunders monitoring and backup

696
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:23,980
communication 91 Metro has a amateur

697
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:26,140
radio station and the office the CAMC

698
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,460
medbay pseudos dispatch for all the

699
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,799
other hospitals they have an amateur

700
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,059
radio station that's that's where my dad

701
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:34,650
has this technician license because

702
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:37,960
after September 11th they saw that the

703
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:39,490
all the communications went down with

704
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,280
with the North Tower

705
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:44,650
I believe so out of the first response

706
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,899
first responder organizations around the

707
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:49,140
country around the world got into

708
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:52,270
amateur radio for just such an occasion

709
00:32:49,140 --> 00:33:00,450
as anybody then where is he not the

710
00:32:52,270 --> 00:33:03,700
movie Brad Pitt read the book strike one

711
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,840
it was fascinating to me I think it's a

712
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,820
very interesting view into a

713
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:11,620
post-apocalyptic situation

714
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:14,260
trailer fairtrade zombies out for about

715
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:16,809
any any disaster and it paints a decent

716
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:20,710
picture of I've had it would act if

717
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:23,460
everything just kind of crash but there

718
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:25,299
is certain chapters in there regarding

719
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,370
communication you know if anybody read

720
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:31,870
the chapter about the pastor not staying

721
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:33,780
at the space station for several years

722
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:37,899
just to keep communication satellites up

723
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:40,660
that was the radio operator out of think

724
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:43,929
it was Pakistan maybe but they were

725
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:46,690
broadcast out survival information to

726
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:49,440
pockets of survivors from from a ship

727
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:52,450
and I was out of a shortwave using

728
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:55,480
amateur bands because it's easy to get a

729
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:57,130
hold of the hardware so of all the times

730
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,090
I've read that book you know good

731
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:02,740
communication is the best way to survive

732
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:04,659
well with water purification you know

733
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:08,619
good food it's a long list but

734
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:10,418
Communications on there there anybody

735
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:14,200
wants to see a fictional practical

736
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:14,560
example of amateur radio twice strike

737
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:18,100
two

738
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,750
we may be the place to do it how do you

739
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,418
handle a deal we're talking about

740
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,560
testing earlier as three levels of

741
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:26,239
amateur

742
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,549
licensing technicians the first pretty

743
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:32,089
much limits you to the very high

744
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:34,250
frequency band there's some some access

745
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:36,168
to the higher frequencies so with your

746
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:39,589
first exam you could be making worldwide

747
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:42,399
you know global contacts even easier if

748
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:45,409
you learn Morse code continuous-wave

749
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:49,339
general is the the next level right now

750
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:52,669
that's almost the entire amateur radio

751
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:55,489
allocation with that amateur extra being

752
00:34:52,668 --> 00:35:01,060
just a tiny little bit more reserved for

753
00:34:55,489 --> 00:35:01,060
the higher level exam the license you

754
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:09,890
can get license to self study American

755
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:11,930
radio relay League they have books that

756
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:14,029
I want up here if anybody wants to flip

757
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:15,799
through it a handrail for dummies

758
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,869
there's my first publication I've got

759
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,130
you can see my rail one book up here

760
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:22,280
that's it that's what I use to get my

761
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:26,060
technician license and major apps all

762
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:29,960
the test banks are public so it's easier

763
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:32,328
for somebody to program a an app for the

764
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,250
test so you can mark what you get wrong

765
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:35,900
study what you need or just blindly go

766
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:38,660
through it time and time and time and

767
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,430
time time again until we've got your is

768
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:42,319
no right answers to pick should the

769
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:44,930
question question come up that's

770
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:48,109
basically let a crime session is there

771
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:50,509
anout all the test questions you'll

772
00:35:48,109 --> 00:35:52,910
sooner own what this one all they go

773
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:55,880
through all the questions several times

774
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:57,500
and at the very end or knock out the

775
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,550
exam while all the answers are fresh in

776
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:03,680
your mind and very legal say but you

777
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:05,140
don't really learn anything but they

778
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,490
should get to push the transmit button

779
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:09,200
there are professional courses that will

780
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:10,848
teach you all you need to know about

781
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,419
amateur radio most where I've seen are

782
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:18,260
offered online even those are self-paced

783
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:19,760
but if you have trouble studying on your

784
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:23,930
own and might be a good resource to

785
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,970
follow and their magic view tube its

786
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:27,890
combination of everything above there

787
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:30,129
are people that have put together and

788
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,129
Tyler

789
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:35,660
teaching courses on using all the other

790
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:38,000
questions those there's YouTube cram

791
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:42,920
sessions there's all kinds of different

792
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,000
resources on on YouTube how do you in

793
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,990
there

794
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,870
cheap HTS or handheld transmitters the

795
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:52,640
thing if you UV father I have done

796
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:57,200
despised throughout the amateur radio

797
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:59,720
world twenty five dollars and with the

798
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,060
free license free license exam you have

799
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,759
to pass it and you're on the air you can

800
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:06,710
communicate with you know within several

801
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,330
miles of here you can access repeaters

802
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:11,030
you can get into digital modes through

803
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:12,620
PC integrations it doesn't take

804
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:15,530
thousands and thousands of dollars to

805
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:17,660
get into amateur radio this is an

806
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:19,250
amateur radio I mean it's it's the

807
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:22,339
cheapest to know probably the most basic

808
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:24,920
but this is my first amateur radio I've

809
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:29,050
got it on Amazon this fire pam idea for

810
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:31,790
dummies book it's all real life stuff

811
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:33,350
relations are changing for these things

812
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:35,180
because they can be programmed to

813
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:38,930
operate in different frequency ranges

814
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,980
that gas radios and IgM is much if

815
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:42,080
you're familiar with any of these

816
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,030
they're just different frequency

817
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,910
allocations with power limits and

818
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:50,270
removable antennas our FCC doesn't like

819
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:50,899
that and it's being driven by some very

820
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,490
vocally

821
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:56,690
how much radio operators that don't like

822
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:59,180
that either so they're pushing to buy or

823
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:00,530
change how somebody can advertise and

824
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:03,169
sell something like this that is capable

825
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:07,670
of broadcasting outside of the amateur

826
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:09,350
radio bands that's a steady on its own

827
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,820
just a legal battle it's not very

828
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:14,180
interesting I don't recommend it unless

829
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:17,210
you really really cannot sleep then dig

830
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:19,310
into it I have never units there's a I

831
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:23,080
think the most fun because you can pack

832
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:26,779
up and take off i capable manpower

833
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:30,140
bigger antennas greater reach out your

834
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:33,680
towards the horizon or even over it even

835
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:35,660
a handheld transmitter with a better

836
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,600
antenna this is just a basic rubber duck

837
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,990
but they get much better antennas with

838
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,100
these

839
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:51,600
it's gonna bring the other one but it's

840
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:54,360
like this big I'm doing it as a base

841
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:58,319
station that's why I said that my house

842
00:38:54,360 --> 00:39:00,960
look that I have 2 meter VHF radio set

843
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,760
up as my base station for what I do that

844
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,840
it's perfect I need to spend several

845
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:09,869
hundred dollars on a big bulky thousand

846
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:14,040
watt VHF transmitter at my $40

847
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:16,490
Craigslist fund as just fine but if you

848
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,590
want to really reach the limits of

849
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:21,569
capabilities you look into the the base

850
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:24,119
stations the you know there were

851
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:26,850
thousands of rats going out with PC

852
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:30,090
integrations I can really reach the true

853
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:32,549
potential of your amateur radio station

854
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:34,890
with with the fancier base stations

855
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:38,250
though it's hard to go good maybe undo

856
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:43,290
some of the the more active parts of

857
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:45,690
amateur radio powerful you can see is

858
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:47,910
really I guess where the fun really is I

859
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:51,390
mean a VHF it's useful but if you really

860
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:52,980
want to talk over the horizon or you'll

861
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:55,129
get into contests anything like that

862
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:59,460
high frequencies where you want to go

863
00:39:55,130 --> 00:40:02,369
there's on it's all on a subjective

864
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:05,010
propagation you get into the the medium

865
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:07,530
and low frequencies the atmosphere kind

866
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:09,180
of absorbs those frequencies and they

867
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:12,330
get into very high frequency ultra-high

868
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:14,430
frequency the Atmos the transmissions go

869
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:16,410
out through the atmosphere so hopefully

870
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:18,750
this is kind of the sweet spot where it

871
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:20,460
can bounce around the atmosphere of the

872
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,490
earth back up the atmosphere and then

873
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:27,330
you can reach South Africa from Florida

874
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:28,618
on five watts using voice so that's

875
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:30,960
that's kind of that's kind of a high

876
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:32,580
frequency is really the place to be

877
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,530
are you at you pay for with high

878
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,420
frequency and then you can spend a

879
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:40,200
couple hundred bucks and you know find

880
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:44,910
something on you know rush calm or the

881
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:46,500
other you know cloning sites where he's

882
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:48,868
you know spending several thousand

883
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,880
dollars on our Ken whatever icon set up

884
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:52,910
really it's one thing you can what you

885
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,309
pay for

886
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:57,379
you know software-defined radio setup

887
00:40:55,309 --> 00:41:00,019
where it's got a built-in display at the

888
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:01,400
entire band so you can scan around and

889
00:41:00,019 --> 00:41:04,069
see if there's traffic there that's

890
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,420
where I'll turn or I recommend the older

891
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:07,970
boat anchor

892
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,799
that's whether you know that the two fed

893
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:14,680
an amplifier a live because they're huge

894
00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:17,509
they're heavy you can find those on

895
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:20,089
Craigslist Facebook fairly cheap I've

896
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:23,809
got one it's not there to work with but

897
00:41:20,089 --> 00:41:26,808
I was a Heathkit it was a little by mail

898
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:30,049
kit built in the 70s so it was designed

899
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:31,700
to be completely assembled by a maturity

900
00:41:30,049 --> 00:41:34,819
operator so it's got a good manual good

901
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,640
to work with hard fun parts though and

902
00:41:34,819 --> 00:41:39,099
then now you get into the larger

903
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:43,009
antennas which can be kind of ungainly

904
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:46,339
they stick it up on our couch Tyler

905
00:41:43,009 --> 00:41:50,319
you've got guidelines to deal with live

906
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:53,420
into it can be difficult and one of the

907
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:55,940
more interesting things is the stealth

908
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:57,979
mode antennas you get into some of these

909
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,479
municipalities even homeowners

910
00:41:57,979 --> 00:42:02,089
associations that don't allow you to

911
00:41:59,479 --> 00:42:03,468
have amateur radio antennas strung up

912
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:07,779
from the tree is taking up at a yard

913
00:42:03,469 --> 00:42:10,400
etcetera so they've come up with with

914
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:12,710
stealthy ways to put their antennas up

915
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,859
and kind of avoid those those

916
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:18,229
regulations it's it's it's fascinating

917
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:19,038
to see what what these guys have come up

918
00:42:18,229 --> 00:42:20,779
with and you know it's they're gonna

919
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:24,049
picture you know can you even find my

920
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:26,029
antenna and if we can't find it we know

921
00:42:24,049 --> 00:42:27,859
what to look for than some grumpy

922
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:31,849
homeowners association person probably

923
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:34,160
can't find it either resources away my

924
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:35,809
favorites especially to kind of jump out

925
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,069
into is hand labor for dummies if

926
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:41,989
anybody's familiar with their for

927
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:43,788
dummies series it's a it's a great place

928
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:46,059
to stay I learned that I'm a technician

929
00:42:43,789 --> 00:42:48,559
license from hammer idea for dummies

930
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:51,079
what surprised me was Pinterest has a

931
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:53,930
lot of great links to other other

932
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:57,619
articles on amateur radio

933
00:42:53,930 --> 00:43:00,499
I build my sampler from the link I found

934
00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:02,650
on on Pinterest so if anybody uses

935
00:43:00,499 --> 00:43:05,980
Pinterest for crafts or cooking or

936
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:07,690
whatever you get off your ham stuff too

937
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,819
mentioned YouTube a linear and

938
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:13,900
particularly from the operators amateur

939
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:17,079
radio operator Dave casler Kezi og he

940
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:20,380
has a great web kennel on YouTube a

941
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:22,059
whole series called ask Dave where he

942
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,940
answers different questions on one

943
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:26,970
subject he's got a self-study

944
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:29,980
section needed reviews products both

945
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:31,240
bottom and top of the line so whether

946
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,839
you've got money to spend or you're on a

947
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:35,020
budget

948
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:38,078
he's probably covered it American radio

949
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:39,940
relay the examiners I've got the general

950
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,359
book up here if any but that's how I got

951
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:45,339
my January license it's got all the test

952
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:47,020
questions are the subjects with you no

953
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:49,690
comments this is test questionary

954
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,460
you know sample quizzes at the end start

955
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:54,700
to finish it and that that could get you

956
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:56,440
your your license and at qst magazines a

957
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,618
month or publication from them i can

958
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,049
radio every week got a couple of those

959
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:05,859
up here to the reserve there's no miss

960
00:44:02,049 --> 00:44:07,750
always a project to work on something

961
00:44:05,859 --> 00:44:11,348
you can build a bit mad dummy load out

962
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:14,020
of a uh an article and qst there's

963
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:16,630
always a story about a d-- expedition

964
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:18,849
looks like go on top those into

965
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:20,730
antarctica hey buddies a nurse and going

966
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:22,599
to antarctica just to play with radios

967
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:24,609
that sounds fun to me

968
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:27,880
but you know there's also you know

969
00:44:24,609 --> 00:44:31,029
Micronesia and tropical islands that's

970
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:33,069
more your your thing being a it's a good

971
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:34,869
it's a good resource for for information

972
00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:36,849
you don't have to be licensed to be a

973
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:38,680
member of the radio relay League or to

974
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:40,299
give this magazine or you can probably

975
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:43,899
find them laying around and you know

976
00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:47,200
dentists offices and whatnot well it's

977
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:50,200
just another good resource that is the

978
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:55,980
end of my talk open for questions

979
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:55,980
comments concerns alibis

980
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:04,910
if you're familiar with radiofrequency

981
00:45:03,009 --> 00:45:06,349
question well is how much do you need to

982
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,578
know before taking the technician

983
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:10,640
license if you're familiar with radio

984
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:12,380
frequency electronics at all depending

985
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,190
on the question is given to you you

986
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:18,979
could probably take you though fear but

987
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:21,200
what if you've not say tada you might

988
00:45:18,979 --> 00:45:24,140
run into some issues with rules and

989
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:28,460
regulations that the FCC has put out you

990
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:29,779
know and especially where you can where

991
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,440
you can transmit because that's that's

992
00:45:29,779 --> 00:45:34,249
kind of bigger on in the technician

993
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,160
section because they don't want to just

994
00:45:34,249 --> 00:45:38,660
handle asses to anybody because if you

995
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,420
transmit it outside of your frequency

996
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:44,629
then that's just the worst thing I would

997
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:47,089
do that I mean you can probably figure

998
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:49,609
it can't hurt I mean if you fail the

999
00:45:47,089 --> 00:46:07,160
exam they're not gonna even mail it in

1000
00:45:49,609 --> 00:46:09,769
so several hundred questions I think I'm

1001
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:13,930
not sure if it's randomly drawn or they

1002
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:13,930
pick out so many sections out it's I

1003
00:46:14,829 --> 00:46:23,239
mean it can't hurt to try see if you'd

1004
00:46:19,749 --> 00:46:25,218
add to your first exam that's rather

1005
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:26,269
than I pass my technicians exam and

1006
00:46:25,219 --> 00:46:28,549
they're like to you and take the journal

1007
00:46:26,269 --> 00:46:31,879
now a lot of study for that I said well

1008
00:46:28,549 --> 00:46:33,769
you buddy you're here you can and if you

1009
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,630
sit and study enough you can get our

1010
00:46:33,769 --> 00:46:37,479
three licenses in one sitting because

1011
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:40,119
after you've passed the exam and

1012
00:46:37,479 --> 00:46:42,558
certified by a volunteer examiner then

1013
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:45,170
here you're an amateur radio operator

1014
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:48,979
radio really all to get here your first

1015
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:50,599
call sign but even if you are if you're

1016
00:46:48,979 --> 00:46:53,210
already a technician and you pass your

1017
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:55,339
general at that time you know you can

1018
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:58,279
operate in the general frequencies as

1019
00:46:55,339 --> 00:47:00,589
well so the reason aggregation is that

1020
00:46:58,279 --> 00:47:02,569
the band playing the safety stuff if

1021
00:47:00,589 --> 00:47:03,529
you're not up on that it may be a weak

1022
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:06,400
spot but if you're familiar with

1023
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:08,450
electronics radio frequency at all then

1024
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,509
might be able to make your way through

1025
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,509
it

1026
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:42,060
relationship of power others to decibels

1027
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:51,119
as few of those that answer your

1028
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:52,470
question do anymore as they thing I

1029
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,580
think I'm saying well I'm probably we're

1030
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:57,000
not you v5r

1031
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:59,940
if you this one is from Amazon you just

1032
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,580
look for you know ham radio handheld

1033
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:03,960
probably one of your top results there's

1034
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:06,630
all kinds of different ones from all

1035
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,400
kinds of different manufacturers but

1036
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:11,940
this one is the cheapest so that's why

1037
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:16,020
better matter cover these for the

1038
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:17,910
different reasons let the entire family

1039
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:20,759
radio service general mobile radio

1040
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:22,020
service multi use radio service where

1041
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,720
there are all kinds of different

1042
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:26,190
frequencies programmed in here and

1043
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:29,640
that's probably our FCC doesn't like

1044
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:32,220
them because it you know there's the

1045
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,379
transmitted on those frequencies with

1046
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:37,129
one of these little blister pack already

1047
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:39,690
as you see that we're not those are

1048
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:44,220
ultra high-frequency transceivers at a

1049
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:46,970
certain certain bandwidth and those are

1050
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:49,950
license to do that and dress that

1051
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:52,319
technically I can transmit on that with

1052
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:54,830
this and that's opposed to its violation

1053
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:57,690
of sec alleles I'm subject to a fine and

1054
00:48:54,830 --> 00:49:02,029
imprisonment eventually but that's what

1055
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:07,050
I do surface there's still have got one

1056
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:09,420
yes see do you know I'm not on these CD

1057
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:12,119
files into their the high frequency I've

1058
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:16,849
talked about the bands other you know CV

1059
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:18,930
is on eleven meters if it was to be it's

1060
00:49:16,849 --> 00:49:20,230
typically not called you know they

1061
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:22,390
allowed me to ban it's just called

1062
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:33,250
seedy but now this one won't do won't do

1063
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:35,529
that yes correct that's the the that's

1064
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:39,640
the section of the radio frequency

1065
00:49:35,530 --> 00:50:09,840
spectrum that's been allocated to go

1066
00:49:39,640 --> 00:50:12,490
back here's the band plan you look good

1067
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:17,710
the wavelength is the distance between

1068
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:19,450
these dotted lines that's when the the

1069
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:21,880
radio frequency of alternating current

1070
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:25,299
changes from positive voltage to a

1071
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:29,560
negative voltage in the air so as the

1072
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:35,859
frequency increases these the waves

1073
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:37,600
themselves get longer and wider so as

1074
00:50:35,859 --> 00:50:40,090
those waves get mounted rather the

1075
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:42,609
distance between the two gets gets

1076
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:46,570
greater so when you get into the band

1077
00:50:42,609 --> 00:50:49,330
plan here you'll see that the two meter

1078
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:53,560
band is within the 144 megabytes so

1079
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:56,470
that's 144 248 megahertz so instead of

1080
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:59,710
saying that they just say the wavelength

1081
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:01,839
of this frequency group is about two

1082
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:05,920
meters so that's just what it is so you

1083
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:07,570
but you get into the sarong higher

1084
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,880
frequencies know the wavelength is

1085
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:13,359
seventy centimeters here in the highest

1086
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:16,960
the highest one there's 160 meters and

1087
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:19,540
between the distance of the the

1088
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,330
wavelength there's one it's coming

1089
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:28,029
should be available this year a thing at

1090
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:28,529
2,000 some meters so I'm either that

1091
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:30,480
this is

1092
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:33,090
the band plan you mentioned that this

1093
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,320
this section here is mostly when you're

1094
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,500
giving your first lesson that the

1095
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:39,560
technician if you see this little

1096
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:43,440
section here this is authorized for

1097
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:46,279
technicians but on the c-w only

1098
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:49,770
continuous waiting for Morse code and

1099
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:51,270
then the same over here and if you want

1100
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:53,940
to work in ten meters

1101
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:57,540
your technicians are authorized on a

1102
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:59,700
single sideband phone or voice and ten

1103
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:02,550
meters so you can get into a high

1104
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:04,649
frequency work and you know global

1105
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:08,280
long-distance communications with just

1106
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:10,650
your technician license but you are

1107
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:23,220
limited as to what you can actually do

1108
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:23,940
on those licenses questions the pool is

1109
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:26,700
300

1110
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:29,640
there's no 35 questions if I remember

1111
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:31,549
right then for the technician in the

1112
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:34,920
general their amateur extra the please

1113
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:36,450
500 I believe without 50 questions so

1114
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,730
it's it's a little a little tougher

1115
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:40,500
there is math involved in that one I

1116
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:44,060
don't know of any organizations that do

1117
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:44,060
crime sessions for the amateur extra

1118
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:56,859
it's on paper 2019 not even a scantron

1119
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:58,719
either alright thanks

1120
00:52:56,859 --> 00:53:01,589
sunder of a tech conference I'm glad to

1121
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:01,589
see so many smiling faces

1122
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,320
you
