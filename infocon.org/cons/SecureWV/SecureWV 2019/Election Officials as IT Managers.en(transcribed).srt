1
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,769

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,080
so good morning welcome thank you guys

3
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:26,150
for coming I hope there is some interest

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,578
in this topic everybody in the back hear

5
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,320
me okay yep thank you I'm I'm not gonna

6
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:34,219
drift as much as the secretary did but I

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,309
will stay more put so my name is Dave

8
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:40,730
Tackett this is probably my 25th year of

9
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:43,640
being involved in IT I think I started

10
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,989
my first 10 where as a technician I was

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,940
a field technician

12
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:50,090
I worked started in the point-of-sale

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:53,209
industry moved to servers laptops

14
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:56,300
desktops eventually moved into high-end

15
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,810
servers was Dells certified systems

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:03,050
engineer working on their same-day calls

17
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,939
commercial satellites so I was a

18
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,158
technician I was a windshield warrior

19
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:09,350
for about 10 years then had an

20
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,329
opportunity to move to the public

21
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,460
segment I used to I used to make fun of

22
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:16,100
all the people that I'd go take service

23
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,719
calls for like man you know you go

24
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,609
something's broken you fix it you leave

25
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:20,928
and as you're driving away you're like

26
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:23,119
man I'm glad I don't have to deal with

27
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:25,100
Barbara and her Outlook Express problem

28
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,319
every day right so that that was my

29
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,939
opinion well then I went behind a desk

30
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:30,920
and had to start dealing with Barbara

31
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:33,229
and her Outlook Express problem but I I

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,450
landed in a really unique position that

33
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:38,479
was sort of crafting itself or branding

34
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,969
itself at the time so I didn't go in

35
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:46,579
immediately to like a help desk position

36
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:48,859
or even on a break fix spot I landed in

37
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:50,568
an industry that branded itself so for

38
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:52,158
about 11 and a half years at the

39
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:53,810
Secretary of State's office I worked in

40
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,109
elections technology for the last two

41
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,909
and a half I've been the CIO there so

42
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:02,630
when I when I moved into the CIO

43
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:05,329
position I had a really at a really good

44
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:09,709
thought about what my job was going to

45
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:12,290
be but when I took over in 17 the

46
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:15,500
election of 16 changed the landscape of

47
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:17,690
my job tremendously and hopefully you'll

48
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,629
be able to see why I cannot take credit

49
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,430
that's why I put the TM after this

50
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:23,700
phrase I think originally it was coined

51
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,959
by a guy named Earl Kay

52
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,760
who ran the kennesaw state elections lab

53
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,550
that served really is the elections

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,590
technology division of the of the state

55
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,239
of georgia for their Secretary of

56
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,489
State's office I think he was the first

57
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,860
one that coined it but in our industry

58
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:43,650
we have used this a lot sometimes it's

59
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,500
attributed to God to a guy used to work

60
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,800
in the state of Ohio and now works for

61
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,050
DHS for sisse it's sometimes credited to

62
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,360
a guy out in Orange Cali California but

63
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,739
we we all sort of understand the concept

64
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,120
and that's the reason that I trade

65
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,250
markets because I didn't come up with it

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,790
but we all use it but somebody actually

67
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,650
did you know coin at first and what I

68
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,970
want you to understand or what I hope

69
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,030
you come away from this presentation

70
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:11,250
with is is a sense of the landscape of

71
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,049
Elections technology and that means the

72
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,970
technology that's being used but also

73
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:16,980
the education that is happening and

74
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,530
needs to happen when you talk about

75
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,640
elections and technology together so

76
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:25,890
those are the things I kind of hope you

77
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,779
you come away with so a long time ago in

78
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:31,548
a galaxy far far away it was actually

79
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:34,170
Florida but I like it sort of tells you

80
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:36,540
my age I was nine years old when the

81
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,608
first Star Wars came out right so that

82
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,070
and I saw a downtown Capitol Street I

83
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:43,200
was nine and it was it was pretty huge

84
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,910
in my life you know but Star Wars was

85
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,548
really simple at that time right

86
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,410
something we've never seen before

87
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:52,049
so when I first thought about putting

88
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,850
slides together for tech folks I thought

89
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:55,500
you know I'll use something that is near

90
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,358
and dear to me and some people may

91
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,000
understand but a long time ago in a

92
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:01,829
galaxy far far away called Florida some

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,209
of you remember the bush-gore thing in

94
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:11,160
2000 yes okay well that episode created

95
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:15,569
something called the help America Vote

96
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:18,450
act right so it is a time of hanging

97
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:20,519
chads right if any of you understand

98
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,019
that too the two things that came out of

99
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,550
the help America Vote Act which was the

100
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,580
federal legislation that was the knee

101
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,560
jerk to the dispute or the the incident

102
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,930
that was the bush-gore controversy in

103
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,700
2000 the federal government created the

104
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,370
help America Vote Act there were several

105
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,650
elements several impacts of it but the

106
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,750
two most important as it relates to this

107
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,698
our Allstate's had to go to a

108
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,520
centralized voter registration system

109
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:48,060
electronic computerized and there had to

110
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,039
be at least one voting system in every

111
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,300
precinct or every polling location that

112
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,270
was accessible to folks with

113
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:58,290
disabilities right so those were the two

114
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:01,080
major mandates for the technology side

115
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:05,760
and this is again the law was created in

116
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:07,740
2002 and all states had to have those

117
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,169
mandates in place unless they asked for

118
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,580
a waiver starting with the 2004

119
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:13,380
presidential election because this

120
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,740
really help America Vote Act really

121
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,780
applies to federal elections right it

122
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,479
has impact down the ballot state and

123
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,729
local but the biggest the biggest

124
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,840
impacts of that legislation were the

125
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:27,169
creation of the election assistance

126
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,000
Commission that is a federal agency

127
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:33,810
responsible for overseeing the mandates

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,570
of the help America Vote Act they

129
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:41,190
engaged NIST which most of you probably

130
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:43,380
recognize to form a tea DG's or a tea

131
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,930
GDC the technical guidelines Development

132
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,639
Committee because if there are going to

133
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,870
be voting systems that have to be

134
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:54,539
certified or if they have to be somewhat

135
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:58,050
uniform or have standards NIST was the

136
00:05:54,539 --> 00:06:00,060
best place to do it that t GDC advised

137
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,070
the election assistance Commission by

138
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,320
creating voluntary voter and voting

139
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:07,050
system guidelines so automatically we

140
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,090
start creating an acronyms that you know

141
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,580
start to confuse everyone

142
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,710
but that's sort of the technical side

143
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,169
about their standing standards for what

144
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,780
voting systems that are mandated have to

145
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:20,250
have and they're also they're also

146
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,138
making recommendations about those

147
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,740
centralized voter registration systems

148
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:28,830
so there was a round of federal funds

149
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:31,110
that went out to States to create plans

150
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,580
the states themselves created the plans

151
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,900
on how they were going to implement all

152
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,260
the mandates of the help America Vote

153
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,599
Act but you know the two key pieces

154
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,090
again you know as as for this discussion

155
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:44,280
the two key pieces are those direct

156
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,169
recording electronic there are multiple

157
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:50,770
voting systems but most of them have

158
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:54,080
some sort of you know some sort of read

159
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:55,640
tabulation you know D Ari's are actually

160
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,340
the touchscreens that some of you may

161
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,919
use in your voting location or you fill

162
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,750
out a ballot its optically read and then

163
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,310
it's tabulated but the other thing the

164
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,800
other the other thing that they had to

165
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,660
figure out was are we going to be a top

166
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,910
down or a bottom up voter registration

167
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,350
system now some of the examples that I

168
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,100
will give or the what I speak for them

169
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,990
is how West Virginia is laid out but

170
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,660
top-down or bottom-up simply means that

171
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,790
either the state at from top down hosts

172
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,970
that VR system and gives the local

173
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:28,280
jurisdictions access to it or there are

174
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,140
local systems that are standalone but

175
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,419
that data is then aggregated at the

176
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,860
state level so that's basically the the

177
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,630
rough definition when it applies to the

178
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:40,730
voter registration system top-down

179
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:42,830
versus bottom-up so with those things

180
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:45,080
happening data becomes available at the

181
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:49,550
state level so everyone that wants to

182
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:53,479
ingest that data or use it as metrics

183
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:55,370
now it becomes it becomes Big Data it is

184
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,900
it is the beginning of interconnected

185
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,030
systems so if you think about that

186
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,679
top-down or bottom-up system how do you

187
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:03,049
access it how do you permission it how

188
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,510
do you control it things like that they

189
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:08,240
are connecting voter registration

190
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:10,130
absentee ballot data provisional ballot

191
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,840
data and candidate data because a lot of

192
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,960
those voter registration systems at the

193
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,849
beginning had some sort of candidate

194
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,140
management component to it as well so

195
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:23,210
for the first time big data is available

196
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,700
at the state level and once you make

197
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:28,820
data available people want it and they

198
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:32,419
want it more often and they want it they

199
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:34,189
want it bigger and better so that joins

200
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,020
the election administration and the

201
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,210
information technology environments

202
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,819
really for the first time they've always

203
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,500
been joined to some degree but with

204
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,660
these mandates you put electronic voting

205
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,220
machines and you create this centralized

206
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,990
voter registration database those are

207
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:54,280
two really big impacts that join

208
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:56,930
elections and technology so morale

209
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,180
basically created this and this is kind

210
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:02,030
of what we use and you can tell this is

211
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:04,099
the best resolution copy I have when it

212
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:06,019
was shared with me quite some time ago

213
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,019
but when you talk about the concept of

214
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:10,850
election officials as IT managers think

215
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:12,829
about who those election officials are

216
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,690
and you know whether you're from West

217
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:16,609
Virginia or other states it may be a

218
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,130
county clerk it may be a municipal

219
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:22,069
recorder it could be but you know you're

220
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:24,170
talking about a person who has really

221
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:25,250
multiple responsibilities besides

222
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,019
elections

223
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,360
they've got record-keeping they've got

224
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:31,399
deeds they've got marriage you know they

225
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,620
are record keepers in our instance it's

226
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,620
a county clerk so those are people who

227
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:40,040
have workflow and process knowledge

228
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:44,360
right about record-keeping and elections

229
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:46,339
with paper materials right so now all of

230
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,319
a sudden they are being asked as you

231
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:50,180
introduce components to whether it's

232
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:51,469
voter registration systems and

233
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,149
everything that connects to it or

234
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:56,060
whether it's electronic voting systems

235
00:09:53,149 --> 00:10:01,490
all of these elements are interconnected

236
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:02,899
and in our case well yeah so just just

237
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,040
think about that we may come back to

238
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:08,360
this but if you know if you understand

239
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,490
all of those systems are interconnected

240
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,970
and you're asking people who may not

241
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:17,600
necessarily be IT capable or IT managers

242
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:21,949
or even have strong resources locally to

243
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,360
support all of those systems one of the

244
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:26,240
benefits when you when you talk about

245
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,360
cybersecurity or even you know influence

246
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,639
like the Secretary's presentation

247
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,380
indicated last night we are by and large

248
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:38,779
a decentralized America and we are a

249
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,610
decentralized set of states because most

250
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:42,680
elections are conducted at the local

251
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:45,949
level we have 55 County Clerk's that

252
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:49,040
conduct elections federal and state and

253
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:50,689
local elections in some instances we

254
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,339
have city recorders that conduct only

255
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:54,199
municipal elections but those are

256
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:58,189
starting to hop on the statewide ballots

257
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:59,389
in the local County ballots in the state

258
00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:02,029
of Wisconsin

259
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:05,209
they have 1800 municipalities they don't

260
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:08,389
have a County sort of structure but it's

261
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:10,160
1,800 separate municipalities so at the

262
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:12,079
state level they are really

263
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,740
decentralized when you talk about trying

264
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,479
to implement things or even even assess

265
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,369
things so

266
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,579
that's a benefit when it comes to

267
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:24,949
protecting the conduct of Elections is

268
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:26,388
we are largely decentralized that's a

269
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:28,519
good thing I think somebody last night

270
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:31,369
had a question for the secretary you

271
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:34,610
know do we ever imagine going to more a

272
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:36,769
uniform platform and the answer is

273
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,470
probably no because I think the states

274
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:41,660
will always fight for any sort of

275
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,959
they'll fight against any sort of

276
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:49,939
centralization namely as an argument for

277
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:52,008
not being able to influence it so we

278
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:57,410
also think of the elections ecosystem in

279
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:59,540
three separate sort of segments we did

280
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:03,379
really early on in seventeen we invited

281
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:05,748
the media in to sort of explain this

282
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:08,240
just to give them a better idea of the

283
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:12,410
ecosystem and so that maybe they could

284
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,420
communicate better you know the more

285
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,709
accurate information and try to dispel

286
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,259
some of the disinformation which

287
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:20,300
obviously we'll get to in just a few but

288
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:23,649
if you think about it pre-election that

289
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:27,529
is by and large a connected segment a

290
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:30,649
lot of it is public facing a lot of it

291
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:33,439
is interface heavy and a lot of it is

292
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:35,540
vendor light meaning that vendors don't

293
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:39,139
do a lot in the pre-election space more

294
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:41,029
more more often than not it's the state

295
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:45,110
or the locality that controls that

296
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:46,549
segment Election Day not connected it is

297
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,470
very private if there isn't any

298
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:52,490
connectivity it is in a private network

299
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:54,649
environment it is vendor heavy and there

300
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:57,019
are only a few vendors in the voting

301
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:58,790
systems sphere right now and we talked

302
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:01,009
about that VBS GE the voluntary voting

303
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:03,829
systems guidelines those are actually

304
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:06,799
being stripped from with some of the

305
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:09,258
specifics to allow more voting systems

306
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:11,119
to be certified and entertained so

307
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:14,179
you're stripping it's kind of like doing

308
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:16,160
a an RFQ specifying that you want you

309
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:18,290
know a particular part where you're just

310
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,719
saying we want a piece of hardware that

311
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:23,059
does this the new VB SGS if those are

312
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,220
approved those will actually open the

313
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:28,219
market for more open source and more

314
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,540
piece part systems and that that

315
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,040
probably is a good thing for the market

316
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,649
overall

317
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,110
and they are interfaith light meaning

318
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:38,120
that there's not a whole lot of things

319
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:41,180
that connect to that very disconnected

320
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,339
private voting system that's on Election

321
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,680
Day that's where voting happens post

322
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:47,899
election goes back to more of a

323
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,599
connected sphere it is more public

324
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:52,430
facing it's a vendor light again it by

325
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,829
and large it's the states the localities

326
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:58,310
that control that and but it can be

327
00:13:54,829 --> 00:14:02,120
interface heavy as well so we take a

328
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:04,518
look at that first segment the

329
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,860
pre-election segment involves campaigns

330
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:08,959
candidates obviously if nobody's going

331
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,899
to run you can't have an election but

332
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,910
that that starts to if you go back to

333
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:16,430
the interconnected map that starts to

334
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:18,769
provide data and information for the

335
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:21,019
creation of ballots which will live in a

336
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:22,699
certain you know segment across or in a

337
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:25,579
certain place across all those segments

338
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:27,349
you've also got emails websites for

339
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:28,969
campaigns and candidates when you start

340
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,010
to think about threat services when you

341
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,899
think about attack surfaces you know

342
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,730
that is a component that voter

343
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:37,130
registration system we happen to be a

344
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,690
top-down we at the state host it we

345
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,490
provide access to the counties to

346
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:44,060
maintain their own voter registration

347
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:46,190
rolls in a top-down environment but in

348
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,719
that environment you have list

349
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,720
maintenance interfaces you've got the

350
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,920
DMV because when you go to the DMV you

351
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,170
can opt in and have your voter

352
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,120
registration information sent to us and

353
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,920
and we will then distribute it to the

354
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,199
counties and they'll process it

355
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,420
automatic voter registration has been

356
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:04,880
passed into law has not been implemented

357
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,500
but it is coming roughly you know the

358
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,079
estimate is roughly the beginning or

359
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,449
middle of 2021 so what the legislature

360
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:14,359
has required and basically automatic or

361
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:16,670
automated voter registration makes it an

362
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,010
opt-out process versus an opt-in when

363
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,199
you go to the DMV and you want to update

364
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,000
your registration if you if you don't

365
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,729
opt-out your information will

366
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,290
automatically be sent as an application

367
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,269
to register or to change your

368
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:32,420
registration Department of Corrections

369
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:35,000
felons and people on probation have

370
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:37,339
theirs you know they're not allowed to

371
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,949
be registered to vote so we have an

372
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:41,750
interface for that online voter

373
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:44,630
registration again a portal where you

374
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:48,440
can go in you can apply to change or

375
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:51,650
register and it is connected again in a

376
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,780
in a sort of the DMZ situation

377
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,449
you also got voter lookup tools you know

378
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,500
again a public facing environment where

379
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,270
you can go and check your voter

380
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,690
registration and obviously that's in a

381
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:05,449
you know segmented non sensitive section

382
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,850
again but again you start to see where

383
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:11,510
cracks open up for threats and

384
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:13,550
vulnerabilities printed and electronic

385
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,980
poll books when those voter registration

386
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,510
rolls are created either you freeze them

387
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,520
and you print them so that they can go

388
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,990
out for election day or you download

389
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,860
that information to an electronic poll

390
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:27,530
book that is used on Election Day

391
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:30,230
absentee early and in-person or early

392
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:32,959
in-person means that you will go to a

393
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:35,090
location prior to Election Day and cast

394
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,880
your vote using a printed or an

395
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:40,790
electronic poll book and you have you

396
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,939
know you you you basically have to think

397
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:46,430
about how is that information stored

398
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:50,300
what's the chain of custody who handles

399
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:53,089
that the location is it connected is

400
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:56,380
there real-time lookup you Aqaba those

401
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:59,360
are the uniformed and overseas voters

402
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:02,960
transmission methods then become again

403
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,060
one area of concern we allow electronic

404
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:08,000
transmission of ballots you know blank

405
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:10,429
ballots through email and fax you can

406
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,550
return it the same way but then that

407
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:15,319
opens a privacy question because if you

408
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:17,839
return your ballot if you're overseas or

409
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:19,609
a member of the military you can vote by

410
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,069
sending your ballot to your local

411
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:23,510
election official they get it but they

412
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:26,389
see how you vote because they have to

413
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:28,160
transfer that particular ballot in to

414
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,810
whatever their voting system mechanism

415
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,390
is they have to create a ballot in their

416
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:34,970
actual voting system that represents the

417
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:37,490
intent so the voter basically if they

418
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:40,370
vote from overseas or if they're in the

419
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:42,740
military they're giving up their privacy

420
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,479
of that ballot when they send that back

421
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,460
to their local election official you

422
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,660
know that's one thing now one thing we

423
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,580
have introduced here in the state of

424
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,620
West Virginia for the first time we

425
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,350
became the first state that allowed the

426
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:57,790
you Aqaba voters to vote through a

427
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,790
mobile voting app

428
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,570
the risk/reward of that is important to

429
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,309
our secretary because a lot of people

430
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:06,889
will have very strong I mean the

431
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:09,350
election security community is really

432
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:14,240
skeptical of that method any online

433
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:17,299
voting but our secretary believes in the

434
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,220
security around that application as it

435
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:21,350
has been explained to us and the risk

436
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,389
reward has been official Tim because if

437
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:26,870
you think about traditional mailing

438
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:28,820
ballots overseas sending them back email

439
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:33,408
faxing them and sending them back in

440
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:36,189
that same method in his mind a soldier

441
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:39,679
stationed on a hillside in Fallujah or a

442
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:41,509
a sailor under the polar ice cap in a

443
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:46,909
submarine does not always have access to

444
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:48,799
a printer email fax machine and most

445
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:50,899
times they do have access to it to a

446
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,639
phone so the risk reward and that that

447
00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:54,799
is we could really go down the rabbit

448
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:56,870
hole on that but we've we've taken a

449
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,940
little beating from the election

450
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:01,008
security community about doing that

451
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:04,039
because they don't believe that any sort

452
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:08,870
of online voting or mobile voting can

453
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:10,129
truly be secured but again for him it's

454
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,658
a risk reward but when you think about

455
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:13,459
transmission methods that's why it's

456
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:15,950
highlighted as I wanted to talk about

457
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,570
that mobile voting app and there are

458
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:19,879
horror stories about a guy in Australia

459
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,559
paying 50 bucks to FedEx his ballot back

460
00:19:19,879 --> 00:19:23,418
and it didn't make it back in time so he

461
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:25,279
lost 50 bucks and his vote wasn't

462
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:27,049
counted very important to the secretary

463
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,419
and a lot of people conducting elections

464
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:32,149
ballot tracking systems is another thing

465
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:34,250
for pre-election if you request an

466
00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:37,309
absentee ballot one of the mandates of

467
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:39,860
Havas that the state provide free access

468
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:41,330
to be able to track if your ballot has

469
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,399
been sent if your ballot has been

470
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:47,689
returned you know been received so

471
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:49,580
things like that on Election Day back to

472
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,370
that voter authentication systems now we

473
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:56,029
basically cut the cord and we operate in

474
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:58,518
a really disconnected vacuum but part of

475
00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:02,899
it is those poll books the voter rolls

476
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:04,220
using used to approve and authenticate a

477
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:04,729
voter when they go to vote on Election

478
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,529
Day

479
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,690
those can either be printed out of the

480
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:11,660
system or they could be contained on an

481
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:14,720
electronic poll book right again think

482
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:17,270
custody you know a possible

483
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,710
you know impact point voting systems

484
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:24,139
those are all of the voting machines so

485
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:26,120
everybody has been to vote yes show of

486
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,010
hands yes everybody who's voted so you

487
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,540
know whatever type of machine imagine

488
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:31,820
you know it can be a direct recording

489
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,440
where it's a touchscreen it can be an

490
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:37,909
optical ballot where you fill it out and

491
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,930
you have it read so those capture you

492
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,090
know the voting devices and the

493
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:45,470
tabulation because regardless of the

494
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:48,800
device it's going to house votes cast

495
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:52,070
and then that has to be transported not

496
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:55,629
transmitted those votes cast has to be

497
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:58,760
transported to a tabulation system again

498
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:01,190
disconnected but but but part of a

499
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,440
little private network in some way

500
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:05,660
there are ballot on-demand options now

501
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,580
there is reporting that happens on

502
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,590
election night but typically that's blue

503
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,530
collar you know whatever that tabulation

504
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:14,750
system is may spit out a report you know

505
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:16,670
that the local election official will

506
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:19,370
just put on a table so the media can

507
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:21,020
ingest some actually go the extra mile

508
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,610
and they will take some sort of export

509
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,010
out of that tabulation system and

510
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:27,590
display it on a screen in the in the

511
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:29,210
center of their County you know counting

512
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:31,340
office or something like that but there

513
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:33,350
is a reporting that happens but in all

514
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,790
of those things that I described when

515
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:38,000
you talk about transporting that

516
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:39,889
information not transmitting you have

517
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,300
removable media whether it's going from

518
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,280
the vote capture device to the

519
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,520
tabulation device or whether it's going

520
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,800
from the tabulation system to some sort

521
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:52,070
of web display or some sort of scrolling

522
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,780
display you introduce concepts of air

523
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:56,000
gaps chain-of-custody

524
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,860
you know your so now you're talking more

525
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,290
about physical controls and physical

526
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:04,639
protections but it still is security

527
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:06,680
around elections and that's sort of you

528
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,750
know described there that soft reporting

529
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:12,290
that happens potentially starts to

530
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:15,590
reconnect that disconnected segment in

531
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:17,960
in in a way now we're back to a post

532
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:21,620
election after election day goes more to

533
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,630
a connected segment you have unofficial

534
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,100
results that happened that night so when

535
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,470
we're talking about printing out a piece

536
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,629
of paper

537
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:30,480
giving it to the media or we you know

538
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:32,158
export it to a web display somewhere in

539
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,009
their County Clerk's office or something

540
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,080
that is unofficial it's only about a

541
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:39,629
week to ten days later after the results

542
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,570
are canvassed that the results become

543
00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:44,730
official okay

544
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:46,799
typically unofficial results are sent to

545
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,620
the state level and this again is a

546
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,230
top-down system on election night and we

547
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:55,739
display unofficial results on a website

548
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:58,230
that a vendor hosts for us but it is a

549
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:01,669
state level system okay so we're back to

550
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:04,889
a connected public facing display system

551
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:07,049
but there are api's against that system

552
00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:08,789
there are exports from that system and

553
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:10,620
there are other County local you know

554
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:12,658
websites where that unofficial

555
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,399
information is displayed once the canvas

556
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:16,620
happens and the results are official

557
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:19,408
then what is displayed after that

558
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,000
process becomes official results one

559
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:23,429
thing I like to point out at that point

560
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,980
is regardless of what that piece of

561
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:28,350
paper that spit out on election night or

562
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,690
what that scrolling web display on

563
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:33,480
election night may say or even what the

564
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:36,120
official results may say on our web site

565
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,240
or a County website after the canvass

566
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:42,299
the election is not there the election

567
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,539
happens in that disconnected segment on

568
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:47,700
this day and it resides in that

569
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:50,519
tabulation system and it resides in the

570
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:54,000
results that are then canvassed so the

571
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:56,610
election happens in a in a vacuum that's

572
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,549
where the official election happens not

573
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:03,299
on the website that is displaying the

574
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:04,860
results we hope always that the results

575
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:07,710
that are displayed match the results

576
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:10,979
that you know are in that disconnected

577
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:13,730
system and we the counties and we both

578
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:16,730
make a big effort to make sure that

579
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:20,009
errors do not happen to cause confusion

580
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:22,259
so after that happens after the results

581
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:24,090
are certified then you go back through

582
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:26,970
an auditing process and that varies

583
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:29,730
across States as to you know sometimes

584
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:31,559
it's a percentage we have in law we have

585
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:34,799
a certain percentage of precincts that

586
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:37,049
have to be hand counted because back

587
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,519
here one thing I didn't come everything

588
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:39,120
every voting system has to have a voter

589
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,220
Vera

590
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,979
viable paper trail so when you do an

591
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:46,170
audit you use that paper copy at a

592
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,060
percentage and if the results of the

593
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:51,510
electronic tabulation and your hand

594
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:53,790
count match then you know you have

595
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:55,860
completed an audit a lot of states are

596
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:58,050
going to a very public risk limiting

597
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:01,740
audit King process which means they

598
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:04,409
audit 100% of everything just to make

599
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:09,090
sure that the machines accurately

600
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:10,770
reflect what the paper contains another

601
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,929
you know thing that we're participating

602
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:16,070
in a lot of states are doing or already

603
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:18,330
have had is G is you know because

604
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:20,250
delivering the appropriate ballot to the

605
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:23,220
right person in the appropriate

606
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:25,350
jurisdiction is really important so G is

607
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,480
technology is now you know obviously

608
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:29,850
being used to sort of audit that process

609
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,560
to make sure that not only during an

610
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,449
election afterwards you can determine

611
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,770
that people got the right ballot but

612
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:40,920
even ahead of time it helps with

613
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:43,379
district maintenance so at the end after

614
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,510
an election is complete or even during

615
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,790
on election night you know the goal of

616
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:50,220
the local election official in the state

617
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:52,350
and for that matter of the country you

618
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:54,020
know we want to make sure that there is

619
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:57,149
a sense of being the trusted source

620
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:59,510
right because we're starting to move

621
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:01,710
just shortly into an area where

622
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:04,980
information provided is not always

623
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:07,290
accurate or trustworthy so you know most

624
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,000
government officials that attempt to be

625
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:13,560
as transparent as possible and show as

626
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,290
much competency as possible but we we

627
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:19,520
now are in an age of disinformation and

628
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:23,399
misinformation it's just where we are so

629
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,530
I'm gonna take a break get a drink

630
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,960
that's a lot of information to throw at

631
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:31,800
you so I'm giving you a cat with laser

632
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:34,050
shooting out of it test just sort of

633
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,560
break up the month monotony this

634
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:41,370
actually is there is a story behind it

635
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:43,250
and this there's actually a website out

636
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:47,550
there called the psychedelic data cats

637
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:49,260
so that's a group of us that as this

638
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:51,659
elections technology industry was

639
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,730
branding itself

640
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:57,450
think of us as I don't know lawful

641
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:59,100
neutral or maybe you know pure neutral

642
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,809
I'm not sure but you know the elections

643
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,570
technology once all this data started

644
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:05,520
becoming available at the state level

645
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:08,039
then more people wanted it and more

646
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,570
systems wanted it so two of the projects

647
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,980
that I've been involved with over the

648
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:15,210
last several years the voting

649
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:17,370
information project by Google if you go

650
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:19,860
through you know one thing that election

651
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:23,610
officials and the technology folks

652
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:25,678
realized was where do people go to find

653
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,510
election information like people on

654
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,890
their ballot where where do I go vote

655
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:31,940
what were the results of an election

656
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:34,260
they go to search engines right so

657
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:37,380
Google took it upon themselves with some

658
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:40,289
funding from pew the Pew trusts to

659
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,240
assemble a program where they went to

660
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:44,039
the actual trusted source now that all

661
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,380
this stuff was available at the state

662
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:48,720
level then they could go to that

663
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,870
official source and get the official

664
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,929
information and build something that was

665
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:56,789
not deceptive or even out-of-date so you

666
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:59,100
know if you go to Google and you search

667
00:27:56,789 --> 00:28:01,260
who's on my ballot you know there's a

668
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,120
lot of other websites that collect

669
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:07,080
candidate and ballot information and it

670
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:09,989
might land in the top three results but

671
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,879
it's outdated right just because of the

672
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:14,490
algorithm or just because of the traffic

673
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,350
an outdated website might actually be

674
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:19,620
sent to the first two or three results

675
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:22,289
so what Google and and Pew wanted to do

676
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,760
was create an official repository for

677
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:25,799
that candidate information for the

678
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,090
polling location information so on

679
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,220
Election Day when you see that little

680
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:31,918
easter egg at the bottom you know where

681
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:34,770
do I vote or you know go vote that

682
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,380
actually goes to a project or to a data

683
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:41,490
repository that is sourced by the states

684
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:44,429
as official right and the common data

685
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:46,530
format NIST just certified the common

686
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:49,289
data format for ad within the last

687
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:53,820
couple of days it is a common data

688
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:56,908
format for voter and elections data so

689
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:59,450
if you if you do a search for voting

690
00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:03,809
system CDF you know common data format

691
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:05,130
it's a great technical representation

692
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:06,990
and a data format

693
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:11,400
representation of that first big

694
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:13,770
interconnected system screen at at the

695
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:19,080
granular data field level it's it's

696
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:20,190
really slow so again about the time I

697
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:27,750
became CIO

698
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:32,330
and after during around the 2016

699
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:36,420
election Star Wars got more complicated

700
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:39,720
right so now all of a sudden my Star

701
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:42,540
Wars is now prequels and and the last

702
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:46,560
chapters and spin-offs and things like

703
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:48,240
that right so my job as CIO the job of

704
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,879
our office the job of election

705
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,620
administrators all got way more

706
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,610
complicated because of what happened in

707
00:29:52,620 --> 00:30:01,709
16 right so you can just look at some of

708
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:04,169
the headlines they're voting machines

709
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:05,510
fire exposes 1.8 open thread voter

710
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:08,550
registration is easy to hack

711
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:10,440
cybersecurity may keep fifty nine

712
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:11,760
million people Russia is still doing it

713
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,000
sixteen year old hacked the voting

714
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,430
machine to DEFCON yadda yadda yadda so

715
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,740
that's the news so my first conference

716
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:22,860
with our county clerks

717
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:24,600
I had a breakout on cybersecurity in one

718
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:27,060
of the Clark said Dave why are we

719
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,129
talking about cybersecurity all the time

720
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:31,590
well because everybody else is talking

721
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:35,550
about now and it's part of your new

722
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:40,860
normal so the significant events in 16

723
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:43,020
became the DNC email Clinton and Romney

724
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:46,939
both had their email their campaign

725
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:49,440
emails were hacked Arizona had

726
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:52,920
credentials for their voter registration

727
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:58,560
system social engineered and posted on

728
00:30:52,920 --> 00:31:01,020
the dark web Illinois and and they they

729
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,560
actually you know thankfully have been

730
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:09,230
willing poster children for what's you

731
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:11,250
know possible they actually got about

732
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:15,390
750,000 records in their voter

733
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:18,940
registration system exfiltrated because

734
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:20,860
of a sequel injection so at least

735
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:24,360
that point a ten-year-old vulnerability

736
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:29,280
you know made them a poster child for

737
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:32,979
what is possible so think about that

738
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,350
once that became known the Arizona and

739
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:38,050
Illinois if we if we kind of go back to

740
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:40,659
this environment when those stories make

741
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:42,610
it to that environment who knows how

742
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:44,740
it's going to get spun who knows what

743
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:49,810
language they're going to use when they

744
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:51,610
do you know the headline so part of what

745
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:54,700
was discovered at the time was you know

746
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:56,709
either 21 or 39 states were targeted you

747
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,330
know we're starting to get pieces of

748
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,950
information from the federal government

749
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:01,689
or from the news outlets or from

750
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:04,240
whistleblowers or whatever we're

751
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:07,390
starting to hear things like 21 or 39

752
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,760
states were targeted well can you define

753
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:11,860
targeted was that strategic targeting

754
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,629
was that opportunistic targeting you

755
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,520
know so you know there's a difference

756
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,840
either you go down the street and try

757
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,670
all the doors or you pick a particular

758
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,629
house and figure out how to get in that

759
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:26,140
one so we didn't have that definition

760
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:28,420
right but they were saying 21 or 39 so

761
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:30,580
we're wondering well was that us we

762
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:33,670
don't know because nobody's told us and

763
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:35,350
we'll get to that in a second too but so

764
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:38,260
you know when you when you start to

765
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:41,310
think about ransomware now in our life

766
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:44,710
or even back then ransomware is

767
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:47,110
traditionally opportunistic right you

768
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:49,900
know it's not targeted but if a county

769
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:54,100
or some system becomes compromised by

770
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:55,900
ransomware is it related to this the

771
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,889
public doesn't know and a lot of local

772
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:01,660
election officials don't know either

773
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:04,690
AWS one of the voting system vendors

774
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:07,530
left an unprotected unsecured copy of

775
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:11,430
voter data out on their Amazon Cloud

776
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:14,080
just lazy about how they had it stored

777
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:16,350
the DEF CON e-poll book thing right

778
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,300
there's a story about somebody hacking a

779
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:23,830
Annie Pole book at Def Con and this is

780
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:26,050
happening in right around 1617 but what

781
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:29,889
they don't say in the headlines or in

782
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:32,169
the follow up story is that the specific

783
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:32,890
Ipoh book they're talking about was sold

784
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,960
on eBay

785
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:37,540
by a state and it hadn't been white

786
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,450
before they put it on eBay right that's

787
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:44,260
not cybersecurity that's just bad

788
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:45,010
quality control yet if it makes it to

789
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,990
DEFCON

790
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:49,390
if DEFCON buys it and I've talked to

791
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:51,190
Matt Blais I mean you know we're as part

792
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,990
of a working group together but if it

793
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,580
makes the DEF CON and somebody gets a

794
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:57,370
headline that says they've hacked it and

795
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,840
found all this voter information well

796
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:00,489
all you got to do is you know figure out

797
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,750
a password to log onto the box and then

798
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,630
all the stuffs there because the people

799
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:06,010
that sold it on eBay didn't clean it out

800
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:09,190
the our systems is one of the biggest

801
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:11,649
thing one of the biggest examples of a

802
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:13,870
phishing exercise you know this was

803
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:17,049
actually Russia they actually fished

804
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:18,460
creds from someone low level in the VR

805
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,440
system and they just eventually worked

806
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:26,080
themselves up with a significant amount

807
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:30,399
of fishing you know hooks across an

808
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:32,980
entire company just like another country

809
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,719
would do to gain knowledge for any other

810
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:39,460
sector of critical infrastructure or

811
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:40,989
even business you know so after all this

812
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,880
is happening and we're learning bits and

813
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:44,799
pieces eventually a mall report Todd a

814
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,110
lot of it together and a lot of it tied

815
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,640
to Russia and what was happening one of

816
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:51,780
the things you know the IRA was being

817
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,339
funded by millions of dollars a month to

818
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:57,520
execute a campaign of disinformation to

819
00:34:54,340 --> 00:35:02,170
misinformation that's not cybersecurity

820
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:04,570
I mean it is but when we look at

821
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:07,750
everything that happened from a

822
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:09,520
technical standpoint there weren't but a

823
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,050
couple of actual breaches that were

824
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,800
known the rest of it happened in the

825
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:17,950
social media space so the Department

826
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,710
Homeland Security because of everything

827
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:22,359
that happened in 16 and after deemed

828
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:25,180
elections is critical infrastructure

829
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:28,270
means elections in the US now is just

830
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:31,210
like nuclear water electric it is

831
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:33,610
critical infrastructure which means that

832
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:39,730
as critical infrastructure you have to

833
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:41,650
set up an SCC which is a sector sector

834
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:44,230
Coordinating Council that's the vendors

835
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:45,730
in the election space they have a

836
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,720
Coordinating Council that develop

837
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:49,450
guidelines and how

838
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,560
to how to navigate the world of critical

839
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,270
infrastructure the government

840
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,250
Coordinating Council was established as

841
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:56,579
well with local election officials

842
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:58,900
secretaries of state that is government

843
00:35:56,579 --> 00:36:01,930
establishing communication protocols

844
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:03,760
standards guidelines about how to

845
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:06,490
function in the critical infrastructure

846
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,819
space a lot of you may know what the ice

847
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:11,979
acts are at sea is ice act and a

848
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:14,440
specific elections infrastructure ice

849
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:17,440
Act was created and they have become a

850
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,359
really really strong partner and done

851
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,000
some good things on the education in on

852
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:24,549
the protection side so when I talk

853
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,859
missteps well so the reason I have think

854
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:28,750
hava there is because this is again the

855
00:36:26,859 --> 00:36:31,000
federal government making some sort of

856
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:35,530
imposition on the decentralized

857
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,790
elections ecosystem in this way it

858
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:38,859
didn't have a whole lot of strings

859
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:42,599
attached to it or mandates attached to

860
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:45,609
it it was more to say our US elections

861
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:47,050
ecosystem is now protected by what the

862
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:49,779
federal government treats as critical

863
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:53,230
infrastructure so but one of the

864
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:56,650
missteps that that made 16 and after so

865
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:59,410
difficult was the people and the reason

866
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:01,829
I think 9/11 is because all the alphabet

867
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:04,660
agencies had a piece of information

868
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:07,900
about 9/11 because it wasn't

869
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:13,060
communicated it wasn't able to be to be

870
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:15,010
prevented right so in the same way a lot

871
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:17,740
of pieces a lot of the alphabets had

872
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:19,300
pieces of what was happening prior to

873
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,669
the election during the election and

874
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,890
after the election in 16 but they were

875
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:25,660
communicating it to the wrong people so

876
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:27,848
if you guys were here yesterday for Josh

877
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,819
you know the state see so or now the

878
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:34,240
state CTO he might have seen something

879
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:37,089
about what was happening at the state

880
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,890
office of Technology but it wasn't known

881
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:42,609
to communicate it to the state election

882
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:45,220
officials right because you know again

883
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:47,200
it's a communication protocol but if

884
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,419
you're also talking about classified

885
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,910
information and it takes a really long

886
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:55,089
time to declassify some things to

887
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:56,049
operational level some of the

888
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:57,970
information that was known by the

889
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:59,290
alphabet couldn't be communicated even

890
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,529
if they would have known who to tell

891
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:03,230
that it was half

892
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:05,210
or could happen so one of the things

893
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:08,510
that came out of them establishing it as

894
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:10,670
CI is there are several of us well each

895
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:12,800
state local you know state election

896
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:14,930
official like the secretary and a couple

897
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,850
of members of his staff we actually made

898
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:19,160
a push to get at least two or three

899
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:21,950
people with secret clearance in each

900
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,420
state election official office so that

901
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:25,609
some of that information could be

902
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:27,470
communicated and it's always in a skip

903
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:30,680
it's always in a in a private you know

904
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:32,180
setting and establishing those

905
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,919
communication protocols who are the

906
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:36,950
points of contact for technical things

907
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,660
for election things when the federal

908
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,160
government has to communicate down we

909
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,930
established our own communication

910
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,089
protocols top-down from the state to the

911
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:48,259
locals as well task forces were stood up

912
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:51,380
National Association of secretaries of

913
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:53,420
state state election directors CIS stood

914
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:57,890
up there I sac for us the elections

915
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:59,600
infrastructure one of the more typically

916
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:02,150
when a problem comes up or when people

917
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,040
have an issue in it's something like

918
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:05,690
elections a lot of times and this isn't

919
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,190
a knock against the academic community

920
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:08,870
but a lot of times the academic

921
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,550
community will take that problem and

922
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:13,370
they'll talk about it and they'll

923
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:14,960
workgroup it and they will talk about it

924
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:16,640
and they will workgroup it and things

925
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,450
and again that's that's the nature of

926
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,640
academia but they they rarely are able

927
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:25,669
to or even need to produce a deliverable

928
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,140
right there is good information that

929
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,970
comes out of it but an actual tangible

930
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:31,730
deliverable a lot of times doesn't come

931
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:36,919
out of that academic environment but at

932
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:39,560
Harvard they created a defending digital

933
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:42,350
democracy program and the two fellows

934
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,390
the chairs of that program are Robby

935
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:46,610
Mook and Matt Rhodes they were the

936
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:50,060
campaign chairs for Clinton and Romney

937
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:52,370
in that election that got hacked so this

938
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:54,860
is a bipartisan effort they stood up

939
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:58,310
this defending digital democracy program

940
00:39:54,860 --> 00:40:01,040
and they used mid-life masters

941
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:02,900
candidates at Harvard's Belfer Center so

942
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,720
you're talking about you know 30 some

943
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,400
things that have 10 years in the NSA 30

944
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,790
some things that have 10 years in the

945
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,980
CIA or in navy intelligence or something

946
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:14,360
like that a really impressive group of

947
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:18,530
mid-life masters

948
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:23,080
candidates created a playbook and they

949
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:25,850
created a tabletop exercise where they

950
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,710
they actually created the worst possible

951
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:30,140
six months before an election and a

952
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:33,440
worse possible Election Day and they

953
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:35,029
they used a few of us in the States to

954
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,160
help them build it and then they brought

955
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:40,370
all the states in and they ran everybody

956
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:42,680
through this tabletop exercise creating

957
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:45,980
muscle memory having injects physical

958
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:48,620
injects technical injects using again

959
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,420
election administrators and Technology

960
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:53,390
people so they they really created a

961
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:57,350
great deliverable and continue to

962
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:59,270
produce deliverables like that and they

963
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:01,460
involved Google Facebook Twitter

964
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:02,990
Microsoft all those heavy players and

965
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:07,130
what happened in that disinformation and

966
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:08,330
misinformation campaign so this is

967
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,970
actually a quote from a friend of mine

968
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:12,350
Matt you know when he describes all

969
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:16,250
those people that are trying to

970
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:18,860
interfere fear into elections he calls

971
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:21,170
them voting enthusiasts but you know

972
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:23,690
what we discovered the goal was you know

973
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:26,450
harvesting those credentials harvesting

974
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,590
data so that they can change it and you

975
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,680
know these are the worst possible

976
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:32,330
scenarios but the goals would be

977
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,830
harvesting it changing voter data or

978
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:35,960
election results you know on the

979
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:39,529
connected side being able to manipulate

980
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:42,470
that to either you know prevent turnout

981
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:44,780
to disqualify voters because they're not

982
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:46,819
on the rolls or even some of you might

983
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:49,640
be old enough to know this but it's like

984
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:52,940
a Dewey wins newspaper if you put out a

985
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:55,609
website that has something that is not

986
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:57,770
correct how what's the impact of that

987
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:59,680
the Secretary has in his presentation

988
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:01,940
the situation where Russia actually

989
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,629
hacked Ukraine's election night

990
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:07,520
reporting system and on election night

991
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:09,680
they hacked in they got a screenshot or

992
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,820
they changed results they they took a

993
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,339
screenshot and they started

994
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:16,280
disseminating that as what was happening

995
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:19,460
in the election the person who actually

996
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,290
won with well over fifty seven percent I

997
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:24,560
think seventy some percent was listed as

998
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:26,180
behind the anti Russia candidate right

999
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,240
who actually at the end only got one

1000
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,980
percent right so

1001
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,109
the anti-russian candidate is shown

1002
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:35,770
leading in this hacked screenshot

1003
00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:38,890
leading the Russian favorite so you

1004
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:40,690
pissed the Russian loyalists off

1005
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:44,098
thinking that the anti Russia guy is

1006
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:47,020
winning right so that creates either

1007
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:49,869
increased turnout on one side or plans

1008
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:52,599
to discredit the eventual winner right

1009
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:54,280
so Russia knew that they were going to

1010
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:55,990
be discovered and that the results would

1011
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,180
be corrected and it's in fact they

1012
00:42:55,990 --> 00:43:00,790
counted on it because the next step then

1013
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:02,200
is when the results are corrected then

1014
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:04,410
the people who thought their guy was

1015
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,490
gonna win as showing is not winning and

1016
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:09,848
the guy they didn't want to win is

1017
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:11,410
showing is winning now you pissed the

1018
00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:13,690
other groups off right now the other

1019
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:17,950
people are mad so that creates a

1020
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:20,140
distrust a lack of competency right so

1021
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:22,419
that's that's one of the biggest impacts

1022
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:24,549
that can have again you expose weakness

1023
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,710
the redirect and sleight of hand comment

1024
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:29,050
comes from the fact that I'm not a

1025
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:31,359
social media expert I'm not I'm you know

1026
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:33,970
I'm not an influencer and I don't really

1027
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:37,270
get most of my news from that source I'm

1028
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:40,689
a bit more of a dinosaur right but what

1029
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:43,839
I do know is if in 16 and to some degree

1030
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:46,900
in 18 if foreign countries even domestic

1031
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:49,450
operators are trying to make me look

1032
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:51,700
over here at social media then I'm more

1033
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:53,740
concerned about my infrastructure than

1034
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,779
ever because I'm afraid they're trying

1035
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:58,868
to get me to look over here while they

1036
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:00,910
exploit something over here right so

1037
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:03,130
that's why there in any anything that

1038
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:06,040
happens whether it's true or not

1039
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:08,080
erodes confidence and you know my

1040
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:12,420
example of Ukraine it's not limited to

1041
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:15,130
US elections obviously so when I started

1042
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,720
trying to explain sort of what our new

1043
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,460
normal was to the local election

1044
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,899
officials and even to the people in our

1045
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:23,320
office

1046
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:25,450
I grabbed some quotes I'm not sure again

1047
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,770
it's it's somebody in our industry but I

1048
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,939
and I want to say that it was jeh

1049
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:30,580
Johnson when he was Department of

1050
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,780
Homeland Security Secretary I think he's

1051
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:33,369
the one that coined it but I can't

1052
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:35,140
attribute it so I just put unknown but

1053
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:37,420
when a country goes after a county it's

1054
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:38,470
not a fair fight and that is really true

1055
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:41,920
when you talk about cyber security

1056
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:44,439
protections and IT resources

1057
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,520
metria pair alferov itch the guy who

1058
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,400
founded CrowdStrike

1059
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,109
his quote was there are two types of

1060
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,119
businesses those that have been

1061
00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:54,220
compromised and those that don't know

1062
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:56,770
they've been compromised that was his

1063
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:59,500
quote but I changed it a little bit for

1064
00:44:56,770 --> 00:45:01,150
the clerk's because there are two types

1065
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,710
of organization obviously they're not

1066
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:05,290
businesses but they are election

1067
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:10,230
administrators and I use the word hacked

1068
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:13,240
because that has become this crazy multi

1069
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:15,700
definition word that everybody uses for

1070
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:17,649
the same one definition right especially

1071
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:20,049
when all this information was coming out

1072
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:22,660
in 16 they said hat oh my god you know

1073
00:45:20,049 --> 00:45:24,430
when somebody has a fake profile thrown

1074
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:26,558
up on Facebook what's the first thing

1075
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:29,470
that everybody does they go and say I've

1076
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:30,910
been hacked no you haven't been act no

1077
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:33,520
you don't have to change your password

1078
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:35,828
no they don't see everything but when

1079
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,750
somebody thinks that a cyber event has

1080
00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:39,549
happened they just say hacked so I

1081
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:41,710
brought that up with them to tell them

1082
00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:44,140
you know hacked has a definition for a

1083
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:46,420
lot of people but it probably is not the

1084
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:49,390
same definition that you might have on

1085
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:51,309
your front porch and then from training

1086
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:54,160
day it's not what you know it's what you

1087
00:45:51,309 --> 00:45:56,890
can prove right so even if an election

1088
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,500
official knows that their process is

1089
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:01,779
solid if any of those things that were

1090
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:06,130
displayed happens it erodes confidence

1091
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:10,059
and you are chasing that rabbit down the

1092
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:14,109
hole trying to prove or disprove a false

1093
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:20,849
positive right and that that's almost an

1094
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:26,470
unwinnable unattainable goal so that

1095
00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:29,140
goes to sort of how I tell them to

1096
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:31,000
approach it and how to start thinking in

1097
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:33,308
terms of a cyber posture or cyber

1098
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,079
resilience resilience so interaction

1099
00:46:33,309 --> 00:46:37,869
between IT and election intensifies

1100
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:39,940
again you know after what happens in 16

1101
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:43,030
there is a new normal but there is also

1102
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:46,630
a new vocabulary it brings IT and

1103
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:50,559
technology back together but in a much

1104
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:52,510
more intense dialogue so the question

1105
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:54,549
you ask well and the other thing is you

1106
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:55,690
know for four decades

1107
00:46:54,549 --> 00:46:57,700
election officials have been

1108
00:46:55,690 --> 00:47:00,880
trying to administer elections in the

1109
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:02,460
most efficient secure accurate profound

1110
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,630
way they've been doing that for decades

1111
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:06,849
technologists have been protecting and

1112
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:10,750
securing their networks their technology

1113
00:47:06,849 --> 00:47:12,730
for decades right but independently so

1114
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:15,550
now you have to have make them have that

1115
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:18,460
dialogue with with a common vocabulary

1116
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:20,800
and the thing you have to ask the people

1117
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,300
is you know the election officials do

1118
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,069
you know where you're a vulnerable when

1119
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:26,170
you think about that interconnected you

1120
00:47:24,069 --> 00:47:28,270
know map of systems do you know where

1121
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:31,119
you are vulnerable in that entire in

1122
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:32,680
your interconnected ecosystem and do you

1123
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,990
know who is responsible for protecting

1124
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,118
you against each of those

1125
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:38,979
vulnerabilities because if you think

1126
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:41,040
about it the state supplies some of the

1127
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:43,569
technology in that connected system

1128
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:46,839
vendors provide others counties provide

1129
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:49,839
others right it could be a multitude of

1130
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:52,060
protectors in against vulnerabilities in

1131
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:54,790
that environment so you have to identify

1132
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:56,349
who is responsible not only identify the

1133
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:58,359
vulnerability but identify who's

1134
00:47:56,349 --> 00:48:00,760
responsible for protecting you against

1135
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:05,290
it the challenge sometimes is when you

1136
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:07,240
talk about state or county it can be

1137
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:09,310
political and when you talk about

1138
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,290
third-party vendors it can become

1139
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:13,569
internalized they are there protecting

1140
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:15,670
their intelligence and their predict

1141
00:48:13,569 --> 00:48:17,619
protecting their proprietary information

1142
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:20,619
right it's just the nature of business

1143
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:22,839
so you have to learn to navigate that

1144
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:26,950
because if you expose the vulnerability

1145
00:48:22,839 --> 00:48:28,839
and you are an elected official you may

1146
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:31,689
not want to disclose that vulnerability

1147
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:34,029
or ask someone to check for a

1148
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:37,540
vulnerability because you may be looked

1149
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:39,069
upon as weak or unelectable right we in

1150
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,079
the tech community really don't have

1151
00:48:39,069 --> 00:48:43,960
that to worry about most things are

1152
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:45,880
black and white to us but you have to

1153
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,680
realize that when you're talking about

1154
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,990
this ecosystem there is some red and

1155
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:53,410
some blue and some purple and some green

1156
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:55,660
and Brandon again introducing just the

1157
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:57,450
concepts to things that we think about a

1158
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,589
lot to people who are not necessarily

1159
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:02,700
technical you have to think about

1160
00:48:59,589 --> 00:49:05,049
network yeah that's one threat surface

1161
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:07,899
connectivity the hardware workstations

1162
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:09,400
switches routers think work and personal

1163
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:12,580
because if you become

1164
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:14,470
target in an elections ecosystem if you

1165
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:16,930
compromise a personal device it may lead

1166
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:18,810
you to a work device right so you have

1167
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:22,390
to explain that or just make them aware

1168
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:24,460
software Web Apps sites operating

1169
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:26,350
systems so many of the breaches the big

1170
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:29,340
breaches have been what known but

1171
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:32,830
unmitigated right vulnerabilities

1172
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:36,250
cybersecurity is not convenient but lazy

1173
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:42,430
can be really can have some pretty

1174
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:44,980
damaging consequences human I don't even

1175
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:46,779
know what to do you know a lot of times

1176
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:49,270
we how do you explain that you know

1177
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,590
somebody has their creds you know we've

1178
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:52,270
we've been saying for years

1179
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:56,110
don't put your password on a post-it

1180
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:58,720
right now at least in our environment we

1181
00:49:56,110 --> 00:50:00,850
have some we have some some credibility

1182
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:03,540
or we have some work we're able to

1183
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:06,580
capitalize on some events

1184
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:09,580
unintentionally you because this is now

1185
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:11,440
a larger discussion when we talk about

1186
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:13,779
password complexity when we talk about

1187
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:17,670
multi-factor authentication you know

1188
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:20,650
it's not a want it's now a need right

1189
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:22,870
and that goes for controls that goes for

1190
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:24,430
mistakes if you make a mistake you got

1191
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:27,250
to own up to it because if you try to

1192
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:29,049
hide it it's gonna it's gonna snowball

1193
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:31,570
on you and then physical security

1194
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:34,180
chain-of-custody removable media those

1195
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:36,190
types of things so the way we approach

1196
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:41,470
it and I don't I have a tendency to talk

1197
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:43,870
long which I am doing sorry so when we

1198
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:46,029
talk about how we approach it from the

1199
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:49,290
state perspective and from the county

1200
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:53,440
perspective this is one thing that DHS

1201
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:55,630
helped us create and it is a security

1202
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,410
planning snapshot it has initiatives

1203
00:50:55,630 --> 00:51:01,510
that we would like to see the counties

1204
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:04,180
pursue and again what's good for the

1205
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:06,580
county a lot of times is good for us too

1206
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:08,460
but you know joining that III sac so

1207
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:10,840
that you get intelligence information

1208
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:12,670
sign up for a vulnerability scanner

1209
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:18,130
scanning or vulnerability management

1210
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:22,120
program and do remote pen tests do cyber

1211
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:23,200
security evaluations go to the doc of

1212
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,140
domain

1213
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:29,200
d mark you can explain d mark than you

1214
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:31,779
know then you've wasted time just do it

1215
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:35,529
and then participate in cybersecurity

1216
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:38,589
awareness so the initiatives recognizing

1217
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:41,140
and and and this as a snapshot is a nice

1218
00:51:38,589 --> 00:51:43,480
just a slick sheet for them to recognize

1219
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:45,490
things because you say need us you know

1220
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:48,310
have you protected against DDoS you have

1221
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:50,169
to explain DDoS right so this gives them

1222
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:52,990
a select sheet to recognize some of the

1223
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:55,599
things and then put contact information

1224
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:59,379
developing an incident response plan is

1225
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,790
key right it post it and test it you

1226
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:03,869
know imagine the worst thing that's

1227
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:06,880
where the tabletop comes in controls

1228
00:52:03,869 --> 00:52:09,280
evaluate who is responsible for what

1229
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,410
you're using what technology you're

1230
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,040
using you know do you follow CIS

1231
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:14,649
controls

1232
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:16,450
do you follow NIST framework you know if

1233
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:21,450
you don't know who to ask that question

1234
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:24,040
of then you don't know your environment

1235
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:25,899
again some of the safeguards involved in

1236
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:29,500
that pre election election and

1237
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:33,400
post-election segments one of the

1238
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:35,800
biggest things is that we try to tell

1239
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:38,680
them is backups you know you may not be

1240
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:41,950
a target but you may have an

1241
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:43,720
opportunistic ransomware event and it

1242
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:46,509
happened in Harrison County here

1243
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:48,720
they had documents that went back to the

1244
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:51,760
1800s that they'd spent 14 years

1245
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:54,669
scanning and digitalising and they lost

1246
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,859
them because of a ransomware event that

1247
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:59,800
started on a backup server laid latent

1248
00:52:56,859 --> 00:53:02,470
for a couple of weeks learned the backup

1249
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:05,079
schema and then after that backup schema

1250
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:08,109
cycle was done it launched itself and it

1251
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:09,579
it killed luckily it didn't affect the

1252
00:53:08,109 --> 00:53:10,240
election systems which is our first

1253
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:12,190
concern

1254
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,979
it's where those communication protocols

1255
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:17,050
come in you learn of an event let us

1256
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:18,730
know we can evaluate the impact on at

1257
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:23,950
least the things that we are helping you

1258
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:26,020
protect so so yeah this is a it it

1259
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:28,000
really is a nice slick project and and

1260
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:30,730
last miles trademark because that's sort

1261
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,790
of what has been has come out of that

1262
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:36,820
DHS program and then the next steps

1263
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:39,460
honestly you know mark something off

1264
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:40,720
make a commitment set a deadline as to a

1265
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,580
time when you're going to have this done

1266
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:47,439
keep that commitment and then move to

1267
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:49,450
the next this is just sort of the the

1268
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,760
mantra that the Secretary has adopted in

1269
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:53,529
our office has adopted protect the

1270
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,390
cheque correct makes a lot of sense for

1271
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:57,700
you guys I'm sure but those are just

1272
00:53:55,390 --> 00:54:00,580
some of the partners we've had at the

1273
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:02,230
top and then at the bottom with the

1274
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:07,590
question for secure West Virginia and

1275
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:07,590
this this group I guess my ask becomes

1276
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:13,120
if any of you can lend your expertise so

1277
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:15,250
now you sort of have an understanding of

1278
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,660
the landscape and maybe where you fit in

1279
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:18,880
and some of you may already be involved

1280
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:20,740
in elections technology some of you may

1281
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:24,100
already be poll workers you obviously

1282
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:26,500
most of you or all of you have voted so

1283
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:28,630
lend your expertise if you have a

1284
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:31,090
company or you're a contractor or

1285
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:32,980
something as you sort of learned that

1286
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:35,230
landscape where might you be able to

1287
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:38,590
insert yourself your business your

1288
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:40,390
expertise because as a lot of you may

1289
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:43,060
know your local jurisdiction may need

1290
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:48,040
help you know filling in some of the

1291
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:49,900
gaps of understanding or protection get

1292
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,250
involved you know if you want to learn

1293
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,200
more about the landscape you can

1294
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:55,750
certainly contact me our office your

1295
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:58,180
locals if you're not from here

1296
00:54:55,750 --> 00:55:01,210
via poll worker you know pay attention

1297
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:04,810
be aware of what happens in the

1298
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:07,750
elections process I'm curious to know if

1299
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:09,940
any of you if out of secured West

1300
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:11,580
Virginia if there is any Intel sharing

1301
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:14,650
among you you know do you guys have

1302
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:18,250
information sharing do any of you use

1303
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:21,040
you know sort of congruous platforms are

1304
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:22,840
you all you know are you all sharing

1305
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,150
information across platforms through

1306
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:28,780
monitoring systems IPS is anything like

1307
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:32,230
that and maybe it would be beneficial

1308
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:34,810
for you to do so and then the other

1309
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:37,720
thing is amplify the correct info you

1310
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:39,960
know once you learn a truth about a

1311
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:43,600
system once you understand you know the

1312
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:46,030
specifics of this ecosystem try your

1313
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,680
best to amplify the trusted information

1314
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:50,050
the official information and the correct

1315
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,680
information and you know kind of goes

1316
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:52,300
without saying

1317
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,430
don't amplify the incorrect information

1318
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:57,820
you guys know better than anybody else

1319
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:59,560
you know about you know thinking before

1320
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:02,200
you propagate information without

1321
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:04,540
vetting it that kind of thing so so

1322
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:06,100
those would be the asks maybe if you can

1323
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:08,440
and if you're interested in it you know

1324
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:11,400
the the secretary has a real passion for

1325
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:13,690
this he's you know 23-year military guy

1326
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:16,600
all of his kids have served in the

1327
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:18,490
military and he he's passionate about

1328
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,690
voting and it's just one of the things

1329
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:22,660
the office does but he's really

1330
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:26,230
passionate about it because his son got

1331
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:28,000
injured in Afghanistan but still said

1332
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:31,300
the hardest thing he ever did overseas

1333
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:36,670
during his service was trying to vote so

1334
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:37,600
the Secretary is is offended by foreign

1335
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:41,350
or domestic

1336
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:43,420
operators trying to influence or damage

1337
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:45,730
our elections process and democracy

1338
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:47,650
takes it to heart and it really trickles

1339
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:50,410
down to the rest of us and I think you

1340
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:53,140
know regardless of how you feel

1341
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:57,190
anytime anybody tries to you know mess

1342
00:56:53,140 --> 00:57:00,580
with democracy it's it's it's worth

1343
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:02,920
defending so yeah that's it any

1344
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:05,020
questions I guess I mean my my emails up

1345
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,700
there and I know I've run maybe just a

1346
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:08,440
tad over but if anybody has specific

1347
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:10,919
questions I'm happy to answer them more

1348
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,920
yes sir

1349
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:45,710
oh yeah we we've offered that up a lot

1350
00:57:44,359 --> 00:57:47,509
of states have approached it that way

1351
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:48,980
because there was one of the things I

1352
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:50,990
didn't get to when I talked about the

1353
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:53,270
partnerships was there was a second

1354
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:57,500
round of federal funding as a result of

1355
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:59,359
what happened on the cyber side so in

1356
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:03,070
our particular instance we actually

1357
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:05,779
created a grant program we kind of did a

1358
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:09,170
70/30 split we kept about 30 of it to

1359
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:11,990
help bolster our cyber posture obviously

1360
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:14,150
some things that we had to spend for but

1361
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:17,390
we offered a grant program to the

1362
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:20,330
counties so that they could take that

1363
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:21,890
second round of funding and do that you

1364
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,180
know work some of them have a really

1365
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:25,009
large footprint with some third-party

1366
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:26,810
vendors there's a couple of vendors in

1367
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:28,490
the state that have a large footprint of

1368
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:30,350
cost counties so they're the natural

1369
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:33,140
people we just encouraged them to do

1370
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:35,960
that assessment so but Ohio on the other

1371
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:37,879
hand and the state of Iowa they actually

1372
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,010
took part of their money and they

1373
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,720
created that force that went to each of

1374
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:44,000
their 99 we took a little different

1375
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:45,919
approach and said you know we did you

1376
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,230
know surveyed them tried to identify

1377
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,700
gaps and then recommend it because the

1378
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:52,160
department homeland security there since

1379
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:55,129
an agency they're actually offering a

1380
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,629
lot of those services free and as we get

1381
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:58,550
closer to 2020

1382
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:59,630
they're moving those people up and if

1383
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:01,790
any of you know about the Einstein

1384
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:03,710
centers the Albert sensors things like

1385
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:06,529
that you know they're offering Albert's

1386
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:08,780
free to a lot of instances and some of

1387
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:09,859
those like in Katz is doing remote pen

1388
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:12,770
testing and things like that

1389
00:59:09,859 --> 00:59:15,560
they're moving election related requests

1390
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:18,580
up the food chain so we try to connect

1391
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:21,920
them yeah I sac has a free VMP program

1392
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:24,170
and so yeah we're we're just we're

1393
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,450
making known all of the resources

1394
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:28,220
available to them and not necessarily

1395
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:29,868
coming in you know sort of like

1396
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:31,520
stormtroopers to go back you know and

1397
00:59:29,869 --> 00:59:33,260
say you know you need to do this you

1398
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,400
need to do this we're trying to educate

1399
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:36,619
them

1400
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,480
about the landscape and again where

1401
00:59:36,619 --> 00:59:40,250
where might you be vulnerable who can

1402
00:59:38,480 --> 01:00:02,990
help you identify those vulnerabilities

1403
00:59:40,250 --> 01:00:05,720
yep yes I think by and large most of

1404
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:08,538
them are parallel I don't that I would

1405
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:11,240
say there are some who are far more

1406
01:00:08,539 --> 01:00:14,150
advanced because of the things they were

1407
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:15,700
already doing like state of Colorado has

1408
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:19,730
a great relationship with the Air Force

1409
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:21,950
the city of Denver itself makes a lot of

1410
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:25,130
states look like amateurs when it comes

1411
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:27,980
to cooperation cyber security Intel

1412
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:29,630
sharing things like that so I would say

1413
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:31,880
somebody like the state of Colorado was

1414
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:34,910
already doing things and a lot of these

1415
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:37,190
things you know I I have a tendency to

1416
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:41,509
say sometimes we're making a lot we're

1417
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:43,520
making much ado about nothing that's not

1418
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:45,920
I can't really say that because again

1419
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:48,440
there are there are battlefields like

1420
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,119
social media that I just can't I don't

1421
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,920
know if you can defend against something

1422
01:00:50,119 --> 01:00:53,930
like that right and the technologists

1423
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,180
have been doing these things

1424
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:58,098
they've just been begging I say we're at

1425
01:00:56,180 --> 01:01:00,680
a threshold kind of like we were maybe

1426
01:00:58,099 --> 01:01:02,270
25 years ago when when the gray hairs

1427
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:04,520
and I'm a gray hair now so I can say

1428
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:08,869
that when the gray hairs that you know

1429
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:10,670
were CEOs of businesses wanted email and

1430
01:01:08,869 --> 01:01:12,770
they wanted connectivity and things like

1431
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:14,299
that you know they asked the IT guys and

1432
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:16,250
the IT guys said you're going to spend

1433
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:18,349
some money you know and then it became

1434
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:20,089
is it really worth it now I think we're

1435
01:01:18,349 --> 01:01:22,819
at that threshold we're spending on

1436
01:01:20,089 --> 01:01:25,069
cyber has to happen right so other in

1437
01:01:22,819 --> 01:01:27,079
that same vein other states were already

1438
01:01:25,069 --> 01:01:28,609
doing things so I would say there are

1439
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:31,549
more states that have already been out

1440
01:01:28,609 --> 01:01:33,710
front the the remainder of the states I

1441
01:01:31,549 --> 01:01:35,660
think are really running alongside you

1442
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:37,910
know because of the resources the

1443
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:41,500
education that sisse and DHS have done

1444
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:44,990
that eii sac I think that education

1445
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:46,910
campaign has made them all stand up

1446
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:48,680
because it's CI now because it's

1447
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:51,950
critical infrastructure

1448
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:53,690
they kind of have to sew right off top

1449
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:55,490
of my head I can't think of any state

1450
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:57,800
that is really behind because they're

1451
01:01:55,490 --> 01:02:00,109
all taking federal money they're all

1452
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:03,950
taking free resources and they are

1453
01:02:00,109 --> 01:02:06,109
focusing on their cyber posture so is

1454
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:09,049
there disparate you know are some better

1455
01:02:06,109 --> 01:02:10,670
than others yeah obviously but but I

1456
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:14,240
think I don't think there's anybody

1457
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:15,970
really lagging back in the pack not that

1458
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:38,950
I'm aware of

1459
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:38,950
yes oh it's it's huge oh sure yeah yep

1460
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:50,180
we well obviously wherever we can find

1461
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:51,890
access controls that we can you know

1462
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:53,330
plant least privileged I mean you know

1463
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:55,609
looking at applications looking at

1464
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:58,130
systems and trying to put the controls

1465
01:02:55,609 --> 01:03:00,680
in place that make the human element

1466
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:04,840
element more negligible we're obviously

1467
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:07,310
doing that but we you know Evan

1468
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:09,530
polyworks for me actually he's in the

1469
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:11,210
crowd here we actually hired a cyber

1470
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:13,790
security specialist to work in our

1471
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:16,130
office specifically because of this you

1472
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:17,570
know that's one of the spends we had we

1473
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:19,250
thought it was so important I call him

1474
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:21,050
like the human sim though because you

1475
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:22,490
know it's we don't quite have enough

1476
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:25,850
money for a sim but we had enough money

1477
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:28,430
for a human but you know he actually

1478
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:31,490
crafted a really clever he took a white

1479
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:33,500
hat approach to I mean hacky I mean it

1480
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:36,140
was it was a black hat black hat hack

1481
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:39,200
done by a white hat really a phishing

1482
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:42,500
exercise that he created so we're doing

1483
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:44,450
that we're we're trying to fish our

1484
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:47,030
employees in those local elections as

1485
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:48,770
much as we can do things like that but

1486
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:50,570
education you know they're they're

1487
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:53,330
getting sick of hearing from me but I'm

1488
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:56,540
trying to like I said just identify as

1489
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:59,180
many free and partnered resources to

1490
01:03:56,540 --> 01:04:00,800
help educate them that's sort of the

1491
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:01,890
moving goalposts we're all chasing is

1492
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:04,050
how do you

1493
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:06,920
how do you educate people to the point

1494
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:08,730
where they know as much as maybe we do

1495
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:11,400
recognizing those sons trying to

1496
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:14,400
identify those flags and things and now

1497
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:16,530
I can say with you know sort of a

1498
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:19,440
half-cock smile on my face that now

1499
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:22,110
we've got at least our employees so

1500
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:24,600
worried that that they they kind of

1501
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:27,150
don't do anything without asking ahead

1502
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:30,870
of time so but using those resources

1503
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:33,690
that are available and and trying to

1504
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:35,339
implement the controls ahead of allowing

1505
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:36,780
you know the human to even factor in

1506
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:38,700
that's kind of what we're trying to do

1507
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:42,570
and trying to encourage the counties did

1508
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:44,790
it any other questions

1509
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:45,840
yeah from the other one one other thing

1510
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:47,610
and I'll let you go I'm sorry for

1511
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:50,640
running over but I do want you to

1512
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:52,500
consider the the vetted security

1513
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:54,589
possibilities the security research

1514
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:57,140
possibilities maybe that this group has

1515
01:04:54,590 --> 01:05:00,000
vulnerability disclosure programs are

1516
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:02,310
are something that my industry or some

1517
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,480
of my peers and I are talking about some

1518
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:04,890
of the states at least that the

1519
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:08,220
Secretary of State level is really

1520
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:10,350
interested in doing be dps for our stuff

1521
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:12,480
and getting the vendors on board to do

1522
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:16,259
that as well because of EDP with a

1523
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:18,570
vendor will at least sort of discourage

1524
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:21,740
so much internalization about their

1525
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:26,850
about the services that they provide so

1526
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:28,470
yeah just vetted security research warts

1527
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:30,060
and all you know I'm kind of need to

1528
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:33,029
know warts and all like you said that's

1529
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:35,009
you know you'd if you don't learn you

1530
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:37,890
don't grow so sometimes you have to make

1531
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:39,330
mistakes to learn well thank you guys

1532
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:40,490
for paying attention I mean I really

1533
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:45,120
appreciate it hope this is interesting

1534
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:48,740
cocoa is valuable and get involved you

1535
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:48,740
know even if even if it's just voting

1536
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:59,600
you
