1
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,340
everybody hear me okay cool great so hi

2
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,539
everyone my name is Katie I work for a

3
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,460
company called age of Health Solutions

4
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,990
if you're not familiar with us we are

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,570
the tech subsidiary of Highmark health

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,610
based out of Pittsburgh PA pretty big

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,469
insurance provider and healthcare

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,269
provider in the region we also have

9
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:35,040
offices across Pennsylvania and we have

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,379
just moved out over into the Midwest in

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,280
Wyoming North Dakota and I believe

12
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:43,260
Minnesota so as you can imagine it kind

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,789
of takes a lot to secure a massive

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,489
health care organization like Highmark

15
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,050
so when I came onto the team about a

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,760
year and a half ago I was tasked with

17
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,610
creating a threat intelligence program

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,680
my background isn't actually in IT at

19
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,390
all my undergrad was actually in

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,470
International Studies and my master's

21
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,590
degree was in security and intelligence

22
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:04,229
so I went into a team by accident pretty

23
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,420
much but I found a way to kind of

24
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,619
combine my passion for international

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,810
relations and intelligence with

26
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,130
cybersecurity and I'm not supposed to

27
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,810
say cyber at this conference so I

28
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,759
apologize if I slip up so kind of moving

29
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,440
into what this presentation is going to

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,659
cover that I kind of start out with an

31
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,210
objective as well as defining that

32
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,740
threat intelligence is as well as you

33
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,380
know how many different definitions are

34
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,149
of threat intelligence then moving into

35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,339
the elements of successful threat

36
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,960
intelligence program and then the

37
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,640
importance of intelligence sharing the

38
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,169
building relationships in that community

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,000
that can serve your organization and

40
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,940
maintaining those relationships and then

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,830
we'll end with some question and answers

42
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,960
so I hope this presentation will serve

43
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,010
as a guide for anyone that's looking to

44
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,100
expand their threat intelligence

45
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,030
capabilities at their own organizations

46
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,530
it's not only going to provide you with

47
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,780
industry standards for a threat

48
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,490
intelligence program but also real life

49
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,340
examples I have for intelligence at work

50
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,020
where I work as well my on trial

51
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,750
intruder methods for developing this

52
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,250
program for my team so we're gonna be

53
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,750
talking about what elements make up a

54
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,119
successful threat intelligence program

55
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,640
why sharing that intelligence is really

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,409
important for your industry sector and

57
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,000
then why it's important to pay it

58
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:17,400
forward with threat intelligence hence

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,989
the title of this presentation how

60
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,239
organizations seek out and enter into

61
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,620
these kinds of relationships and when

62
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,209
they're establish how exactly do you

63
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,319
maintain them which is arguably the most

64
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:28,829
important part

65
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,988
Oh threat intelligence so when I was

66
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:32,999
looking into definitions of threat

67
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:35,370
intelligence there's no one real clear

68
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:36,629
answer for it but this is a definition I

69
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,999
found it was kind of the most

70
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:40,828
encompassing so threat intelligence is

71
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:42,900
evidence-based knowledge including

72
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:44,730
context mechanisms indicators

73
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,159
implications of action-oriented advice

74
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,170
about an existing or emerging rellis or

75
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,578
hazard to assets this intelligence can

76
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,200
be used to inform decisions regarding

77
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:54,030
that subjects response to that Menace or

78
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,560
hazard as you can see it's super long

79
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,169
and no one's ever going to remember that

80
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,030
if you make that the kind of center of

81
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:03,269
your program no one's really going to

82
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,530
know what objectives are defined so when

83
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:06,840
I was building this out from my

84
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,069
organization I kind of looked at what we

85
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,169
were looking to accomplish and what

86
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:12,480
goals we already had in place so

87
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:14,040
therefore our definitions threat

88
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,388
intelligence is information that helps

89
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,010
the organization prevent attacks

90
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:18,930
understand threats that endanger their

91
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,239
unique environment seesee remember

92
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,159
everyone's got a clear idea what exactly

93
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,849
this is set out to do and what you can

94
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,319
accomplish with it so the form is of a

95
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:30,268
successful threat intelligence program

96
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,858
the first is being that threat

97
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:34,470
intelligence impacts other areas besides

98
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:36,209
security if you're in the private sector

99
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,459
like me your threat intelligence serves

100
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,169
the business therefore you're at Intel

101
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,079
should inform an augment services other

102
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:45,329
than security this this encompasses a

103
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:47,310
wide area of departments so that can be

104
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,319
your privacy and Luber people you're

105
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,840
risking compliance folks as well as

106
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,488
corporate and physical security and then

107
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,930
marketing policy and Finance might not

108
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:56,939
be things that you think about when

109
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,370
threat intelligence affects them but it

110
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:01,259
really does the second would be

111
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,180
communication with the business so when

112
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:04,589
you're building out a comprehensive

113
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,030
threat profile

114
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,009
knowing what is relevant to the

115
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,870
organization requires communication with

116
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:11,608
these various business functions so you

117
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,379
have to be able to make sure that you

118
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:15,060
have really good relationships with

119
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:17,250
employees and teams on the business side

120
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,630
as well as the security side that we are

121
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,699
not really leaving anybody out and

122
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,520
you're knowing that initiatives are

123
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,930
going on in your organization also

124
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,448
involvement in groups I bring together

125
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,550
security and business side I know at my

126
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:31,289
organization we have a bunch of

127
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,120
different rotational employee groups of

128
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:34,719
bringing employees from the business

129
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,250
side and the security side

130
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,440
everyone can kind of get an idea of what

131
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,240
each side does which has been really

132
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,260
really helpful for us when it comes to

133
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,140
building out our threat intelligence

134
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,550
program you also need to update the

135
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,159
business with relevant intelligence

136
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,780
briefs as new threats emerge we are

137
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,700
constantly communicating with groups

138
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,320
like our ability governance group as

139
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,670
well as our medical device security

140
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,070
group over at our hospitals because

141
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,540
those kinds of threats directly affect

142
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,180
our business and our patients on a daily

143
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,890
basis you all seem to update your

144
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,140
security teams as was as roll out new

145
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,180
high profile projects for example

146
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,450
marketing teams if they're putting out

147
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,890
commercials that are really promoting a

148
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,750
new initiative that they're rolling out

149
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,159
that could put your organization at risk

150
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,050
because attackers are going to see it

151
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,730
and know that this is what's going to

152
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,310
make you an organization vulnerable to

153
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,690
something when the last piece of that

154
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,280
intelligence can increase visibility

155
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:27,040
into threats organization and create

156
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,659
faces as a whole so when we int happens

157
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,290
disseminate intelligence to these other

158
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:35,290
areas the business has a better idea of

159
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:38,169
kind of what it takes to be security

160
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:39,730
minded so not only increasing security

161
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:41,020
awareness but you're helping the

162
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,580
business create smaller marketing

163
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,159
campaigns that don't expose your

164
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,930
organization to threats but also informs

165
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,400
teams across the organization of risks

166
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,900
associated into entering within to

167
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,940
contract with third-party vendors

168
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,219
probably one of the biggest threats that

169
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,570
we face at high mark is entering into

170
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,370
relationships with vendors that can't be

171
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,599
trusted so we want to make sure that

172
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,190
we're vetting those and constantly

173
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,200
communicating with our business partners

174
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:05,560
on what contracts are looking at to

175
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,479
enter into the second element would be

176
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,030
identifying separate operational as

177
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:12,190
strategic goals so strategically as you

178
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:15,130
can kind of think as more of like hard

179
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,780
scales or things that you can no sorry

180
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,610
soft skills or things that you can't

181
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,650
really quantify

182
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,510
being things like relationship building

183
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,000
or trend identification things that you

184
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:27,580
rely on your analyst for humans are

185
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,860
skills most operational skills would be

186
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,780
things that you can quantify and count

187
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,880
and more of your skills like ants

188
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,739
identification categorization or

189
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,650
defensive controls or assigning alerts

190
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,910
to hours on their workload an example of

191
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,859
operational

192
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,360
solution would be a slower platform if

193
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,980
you're not familiar with what a short

194
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,720
platform is it's a security

195
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,060
orchestration automation and response

196
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,220
tool which basically allows you to go up

197
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,280
playbooks and automate all of your about

198
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,440
monitoring and incident response making

199
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,969
much easier for the analyst to free up

200
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,860
their time to work on special projects

201
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,810
or focus on how to put high-profile

202
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,250
incidents well as a tool for the

203
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,840
strategic side would be a performance

204
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,790
management platform so analysts could

205
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,200
easily track their goals track their

206
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,090
skills that they're proficient in as

207
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,770
well as find out where they're weakest

208
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:15,369
or where they're weakest skills are and

209
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:16,690
how they can improve them this third

210
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,040
success element would be a working

211
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,620
partnership with larger security

212
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,140
organizations so there are obviously

213
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,010
many benefits to entering into different

214
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,560
kinds of intelligence sharing

215
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:29,620
relationships one of them being knowing

216
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,510
about threats in real time as a health

217
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,270
care organization we are involved with h

218
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:36,310
isaac which was e healthcare information

219
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:39,190
security and i don't really remember

220
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:42,850
what the acronym means but they do have

221
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:44,680
a live chat on the reporter and my

222
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,540
analysts and i are constantly in that

223
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,710
chat all day long conversing with other

224
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,420
analysts or their pilot the health

225
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,979
organization other healthcare

226
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,360
organizations across the country to know

227
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,190
about threats so their organizations are

228
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,240
facing in real-time

229
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,210
there's also incentives and benefits

230
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,680
like training in addition to conferences

231
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,690
for example I'm going to be speaking at

232
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,280
the hi-5 fall summit I wouldn't have had

233
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,230
that opportunity if I wasn't part of a

234
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,729
health organization or a part of the

235
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:10,180
intelligence community that exists

236
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:11,470
within my industry sector you also get

237
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,820
to help others out in your community

238
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,310
with intelligence on threats that you

239
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,900
discover a really great example of this

240
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,580
and moving down to the bottom part of

241
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,580
examples of organizations for threat

242
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:23,560
intelligence relationships such as our

243
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,930
fusion center in western Pennsylvania

244
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,310
it's a public-private partnership with

245
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,800
our real private sector and law

246
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:32,559
enforcement I think there are couple

247
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,419
that exists like down the East Coast

248
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,760
not sure exactly sure all of them are

249
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:38,020
but if there are in your area I really

250
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,120
encourage you to seek out that

251
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,590
partnership with them they can actually

252
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,840
with other private organizations in your

253
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,370
as well as law enforcement and give you

254
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,110
access to a lot of really really great

255
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,110
pieces of intelligence that you can use

256
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,730
to better protect your organization's

257
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:55,250
FBI nefra guard also really really great

258
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,990
source they vet everybody that comes in

259
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,510
to infrared so you have to go through a

260
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,430
background check but you get access to a

261
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,170
confidential database as well as

262
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:06,650
confidential documents that are only

263
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:08,479
disseminated to InfraGard members a choc

264
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:10,610
is a really great one the ice axe exists

265
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,400
for I think most critical infrastructure

266
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,960
sectors so if you're not probably the

267
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,410
healthcare I think to have one for the

268
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,220
financial sector as well as a couple

269
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,410
different ones

270
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,450
and then the last one blue intel if

271
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:26,270
you're not super familiar with the Blues

272
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:28,310
plans blue Intel is a top-secret

273
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:31,339
organization that serves as an

274
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,800
intelligence provider for all of the

275
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:35,060
glutens across the country so if you

276
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,579
were to do that you wouldn't find

277
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,890
anything for it which makes them super

278
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,510
exclusive but also a really really

279
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:44,660
valuable source for those of us in the

280
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:46,279
healthcare industry they also have a TLP

281
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,079
black chat which a couple of our

282
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:49,670
analysts are part of and constantly

283
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,440
conversing with analyst over there I'm

284
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,000
like hey we're seeing this kind of

285
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,620
traffic on our network can you double

286
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,850
check and see with anybody else in the

287
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,339
Blues plants is having this kind of

288
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,230
issue because typically if one blues

289
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:02,450
plant is seeing it others are as well

290
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,750
health care is a hugely targeted

291
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:09,080
industry for cybercrime so it's a really

292
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,970
good place for us to be the force is

293
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,680
building profiles on threat actors so

294
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,260
when you have a profile threat out there

295
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,400
it allows who better protection as well

296
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,930
as mitigation against future attacks

297
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,360
you're constantly gathering information

298
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:23,000
on what that actor can do as well as

299
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,470
what their known threat vectors are web

300
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,820
practices are usually used to gain

301
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,040
access to your organization and what

302
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:31,220
they do when they gain access

303
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,730
so in categorization of those areas just

304
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,920
as important as building those profiles

305
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:39,670
example of that would be Imhotep we see

306
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,020
a ton of this in the healthcare industry

307
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,449
and usually they doing through fishing

308
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:47,569
as we all know your users are your

309
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:49,250
weakest link so you know creating really

310
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,900
good security awareness campaigns so

311
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,520
really great way to mitigate that but

312
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,990
also knowing the characteristics of

313
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,819
email type before it even reaches your

314
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,739
environment

315
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:59,529
is a really good way to provide protect

316
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:02,049
yourself when everyone is learning from

317
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:04,029
attacks on other other organizations at

318
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:05,410
last rebuttal protection for yourself as

319
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:08,199
well as adding information to your

320
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:11,169
threat profiles a really good example of

321
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:13,748
this would be if any of you are familiar

322
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:15,639
with the company that health but they

323
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:18,039
pull out products called woundexpert

324
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:21,189
which we use at all of our hospitals we

325
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:23,169
got tipped off from someone at HR sack

326
00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:25,839
that they had been compromised by

327
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:27,879
ransomware attack I was able to go into

328
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,879
the embarrassed distribution list for

329
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:32,410
the H Isaac you know this drill and ask

330
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,539
other members hey are you seeing

331
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:36,850
anything from these different IO sees a

332
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:38,439
couple of different people were we were

333
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,629
able to reach out to the vendor and say

334
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:42,699
hey this is going on you should probably

335
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:44,109
be aware of it they went into a network

336
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:45,910
found out there had been compromised

337
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:46,799
with Reed and Rea they'll shut

338
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,269
everything down

339
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:52,239
we were actually not affected by our

340
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:53,649
thank God but while we were able to

341
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:55,839
converse with other members that we're

342
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:57,249
seeing this problem we were able to get

343
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,169
that incident result even more quickly

344
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:02,829
if we hadn't seen that or had access to

345
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:05,228
those resources so moving into the

346
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:06,728
importance of intelligence sharing the

347
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:08,199
first benefit I want to talk about is

348
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:09,939
the discovery of own abilities data

349
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:11,679
breaches and security incidents in

350
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:14,319
real-time or soon after

351
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:16,988
so using these benefits like a chatroom

352
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:19,509
or an email distro or even just the

353
00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:21,699
single email address or a phone one that

354
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:25,329
you have as a contact is much better

355
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:27,248
than having nothing at all the second

356
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:28,988
would be successful methods of

357
00:12:27,249 --> 00:12:31,209
mitigating security thoughts you know

358
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:33,039
you can go to somebody and be like hey I

359
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,868
know that you dealt with this kind of

360
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:38,079
incident four months ago

361
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:39,879
what did she do this result that there's

362
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,769
also there's also a great community

363
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:43,539
where practices for stock structure or

364
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:45,159
processes then those things of that

365
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:47,470
nature are discussed in a regular basis

366
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:49,449
I know I constantly give people advice

367
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,759
on which soon as I should be going with

368
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:53,679
based on our choices in the past as well

369
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,269
as you know if we're thinking about

370
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,009
going with a specific vendor I can reach

371
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:58,689
out with somebody and ask them hey have

372
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:01,379
you worked these people in the past are

373
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:03,549
they reliable they look at the job done

374
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:06,249
then you get access to intelligence

375
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:07,709
reports that provide insight to various

376
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:10,170
different info security news

377
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:12,300
relevant to whatever your industry might

378
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:15,000
be what for me is healthcare so I know

379
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,890
we subscribe to the PA states state

380
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,390
police either import provide us with a

381
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,500
lot of really great pieces of

382
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,020
intelligence that have led us to

383
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,690
discovery of incidents in the past but

384
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,829
that's just one really good example

385
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,690
there's also exclusive training in

386
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:29,160
classes for community members that

387
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,650
contribute intelligence to the butcher

388
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,900
they're part of I'm a fusion liaison

389
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,579
officer will be a fusion center in my

390
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,970
area so that means that I'll get

391
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,680
exclusive access to our HSN database if

392
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:43,380
you were been stalking here yesterday he

393
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,439
mentioned that a little bit but it's a

394
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,930
group where you can confidentially share

395
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,090
information with other members and get

396
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,620
access to really great training having

397
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,570
to do a critical infrastructure in law

398
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,970
enforcement and protection of private

399
00:13:54,570 --> 00:14:00,270
sector as well as really build

400
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,770
intelligence reports you can also help

401
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,960
law enforcement quickly respond to

402
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,730
incidents so you know see something say

403
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,160
something that goes true the private

404
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,840
sector as well you can't you really do

405
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:14,280
want to try to help our members of your

406
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:15,990
of your industry and whether that be you

407
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,339
know through law enforcement or just

408
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,840
through your chat rooms that you are

409
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,220
constantly connecting with people on

410
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,770
it's a really good way to make sure

411
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,860
everyone stays protected so it won't

412
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:27,090
success story I want to mention here I

413
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,920
don't know if you guys are familiar with

414
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,680
the threat intelligence platform a

415
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,180
quarter future anyone heard of them

416
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,920
great that's a news for threat

417
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,680
intelligence platform we've had really

418
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,089
really big results with them well they

419
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,160
actually reached out to us when they

420
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:43,380
discover that adversary was scraping one

421
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,660
of our databases for a dentist

422
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,340
information so wellness might not seem

423
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,110
like a huge deal it was causing a really

424
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,090
huge soda our database a lot of

425
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:54,000
customers are being affected phones

426
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:55,440
ringing off the hook was a good time but

427
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,780
basically we were given enough

428
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,430
information by our partners that record

429
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,290
a future and then able to reach out to

430
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,640
other members in the health care sector

431
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,469
to see if they were having similar

432
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,720
issues with their databases because

433
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,720
usually if it's just one it's not just

434
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,460
one it's always multiple so we were able

435
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,920
to kind of gather more information from

436
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,810
social media other Osen sources and

437
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,300
figure out that this guy was just a guy

438
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,660
in his mom's basement team what he could

439
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,609
do on a database

440
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,810
I'm serious and the information he was

441
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,560
scraping floor was all open-source

442
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,290
information

443
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,459
anyways but if we hadn't known that it

444
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,410
might have gotten worse and he could

445
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,420
have actually gained access to value or

446
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,370
pH I on our systems if we had been able

447
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,719
to stop him from that tip that we've

448
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:39,160
gotten from what Amari out one of our

449
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:42,040
Intel partners so building intelligence

450
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:45,069
relationships I hate to say that but not

451
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,209
working I know everyone sells out to you

452
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,770
when you're going to these kinds of

453
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,990
things network with people that are

454
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:51,640
like-minded or you know reach out to

455
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,560
people in the organization that might

456
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,050
know others but it is really important

457
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,359
attending conferences like this one not

458
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:59,920
just InfoSec conferences but you know

459
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,920
critical infrastructure conferences if

460
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,329
that's where you are involved in or even

461
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,150
just you know going to dinner with

462
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,380
people or going to meetups it's a really

463
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:11,920
big way to build your intelligence

464
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:14,320
community so there's like these sides is

465
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,729
essay forms are also really good I think

466
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,160
they put them on nationwide just

467
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:20,650
depending on your region as well as hif

468
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,439
summits punk off Def Con etc you know

469
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:24,640
pick your poison

470
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,370
also engage with local government

471
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,319
departments in law enforcement I had the

472
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,090
fortunate opportunity to intern with my

473
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,590
local emergency management office when I

474
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,180
was in grad school so that's how I ended

475
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:36,580
up making a lot of the contacts that I

476
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,709
use today but even just going out to

477
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,850
local events that are sponsored by your

478
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,800
local government or your local law

479
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,210
enforcement is a really great way to get

480
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,250
your face out there and get to know

481
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:48,970
people in your community which can help

482
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:50,500
you along the way excuse me also seek

483
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:53,710
our publications put out by various

484
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,990
federal state and local agencies I

485
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:58,750
mentioned earlier that we use a PA state

486
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:02,500
state police I will report I think that

487
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:04,900
most states have a cyber cyber

488
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,780
department at their State Police

489
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,400
Department so kind of seek out those

490
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,690
publications and see if there's

491
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,400
something available like that in your

492
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,960
area we've gotten a lot of really

493
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,290
valuable information from things like

494
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:19,750
that also you know any sort of member

495
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,280
portal Amber lists email destroyed which

496
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,839
you can become a part of is a really

497
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,670
great way to find out about things in

498
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,619
real time and provide additional

499
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:29,500
intelligence to things that you're

500
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:31,020
already working on and InfraGard I

501
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,870
mentioned that already

502
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,010
but I think the most important part of

503
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,669
all of this is maintaining those

504
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:39,390
relationships the difference between

505
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,700
building these relationships and

506
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,870
sustaining them is huge so you know you

507
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,610
can shake someone's hand to exchange

508
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,928
business cards at a conference but if

509
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,570
you don't follow up with that then it

510
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:50,460
pretty much means nothing so you know

511
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,200
actively participating contribute to

512
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,520
discussions with your intelligence

513
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,800
community and make sure those

514
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,450
relationships are remaining strong so if

515
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,370
they share something with you tell them

516
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,960
how you use it if you hope to if you

517
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,399
used it to help solve an incident your

518
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,309
company tell them exactly what you did

519
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,320
with it if you can obviously but then

520
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:08,879
also make sure to return the favor next

521
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,290
time you discover something useful if

522
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,600
your company is dealing with something

523
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,670
and you want to make sure that no else

524
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,139
has to do with that incident as well you

525
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,960
know reach out to somebody and let them

526
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,890
know how you use that intelligence

527
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,020
attend networking events but also

528
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:24,630
champion with your contacts for example

529
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,000
the surfers people out there I ran into

530
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,679
the three conferences this fall and we

531
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,970
have a really big relationship because I

532
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,100
always make sure to go up and say hi

533
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:33,840
exchange pleasantries see how they're

534
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,399
doing

535
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,830
I also seek out training opportunities

536
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,330
put out by local organizations I don't

537
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,730
know if you are familiar with the NC FTA

538
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,110
but it's based in Pittsburgh it stands

539
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,840
for the national cyber forensics

540
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:49,290
training alliance they put out really

541
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,659
really fantastic training for InfoSec

542
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:54,240
digital forensics anything you can think

543
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,230
of they are a nonprofit organization so

544
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,840
the trainings don't tend to be that

545
00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:01,140
expensive even get to Pittsburgh highly

546
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:04,340
recommend but that's all I had is

547
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,340
anybody have any questions

548
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:24,250
do you work for a beliefs plan yeah

549
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,890

550
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:32,559
Blue Cross Blue Shield's health plans so

551
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:47,710

552
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:50,280
