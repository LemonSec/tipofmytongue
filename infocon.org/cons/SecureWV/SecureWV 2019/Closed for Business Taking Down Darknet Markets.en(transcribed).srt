1
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:18,470
all right second three

2
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:22,009
this works we'll get going all right

3
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:23,538
good morning how y'all doing

4
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,750
so my name's Jon Scheyer I worked for

5
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:30,080
Sophos in the office of the CTO and my

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:32,058
job is to look at security as an

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,680
industry as opposed to when you think

8
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:35,690
about security companies and researchers

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,830
you think about the guys working guys

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,690
and girls working in labs right the

11
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,489
people that are actually looking for the

12
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,290
bad stuff and then finding ways of

13
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:43,699
protecting against it and we do have a

14
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,890
lot of those people that work in our

15
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:47,750
labs that focus on all sorts of

16
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,390
different areas of the threat and we do

17
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,739
that as well in my group it is but what

18
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,780
we also do is we kind of peel back a

19
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:56,180
little bit and try to have a just a

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:59,270
better view of the entire landscape and

21
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:01,219
and how security impacting our partners

22
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:04,309
our customers and the general public at

23
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:08,270
large and this talk kind of came out of

24
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:10,460
that it's more of a an area of interest

25
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:13,280
I did a talk last year about how to

26
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,690
become a cyber criminal just by jumping

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,270
on the dark web and trolling around and

28
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,460
seeing what you could find right and out

29
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:23,780
of that it was right around the time

30
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:26,479
that the the Alpha Bay seizure had

31
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,310
happened and you know it was kind of a

32
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,229
side note to this story but I thought

33
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,479
that was kind of interesting let's dive

34
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:36,440
into that and this is really about some

35
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,810
of the wins as a security industry that

36
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,649
we've had with respect to taking down

37
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:44,929
some of these these criminals in

38
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:46,459
specifically on the dark web and so I

39
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:49,220
wanted to tell that story because I

40
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:50,390
think we hear a lot about the losses we

41
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,590
hear a lot about the negative stuff we

42
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,690
go to security conferences it's kind of

43
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,729
fun to just look back and see you know

44
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,190
what happens when we win and what are we

45
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:59,599
doing about it so we're gonna

46
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,220
specifically talk about things like

47
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,209
alpha Bay and Hansa today and some of

48
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,119
the darknet markets that are out there

49
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:06,920
and I'll explain along the way how these

50
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,229
market works these markets work because

51
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,209
I think some people just don't kind of

52
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:14,300
get the whole economics of it so we'll

53
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:15,560
explore that a little bit and what's fun

54
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,970
about doing some of this research is

55
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,500
when you have sort of you have a focus

56
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,819
topic in mind you like a I'm gonna talk

57
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,060
about this and I'll be really fun and

58
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:24,708
then stuff happens and you've got sort

59
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,650
of take a left or a right turn and that

60
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:28,270
happened when I was doing this research

61
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,620
so what the

62
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,760
talks not gonna be about those I'm not

63
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,040
gonna go into any of the moral and

64
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,540
ethical implications of the dark web and

65
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,799
the dark net markets and all the drugs

66
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,120
and weapons and all kind of stuff that

67
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,130
are available on there we can we can

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,920
talk about that afterwards but we're

69
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,390
really here to just talk about the the

70
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,489
darknet markets themselves and then what

71
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,739
happens when security researchers and

72
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:50,650
law enforcement start to poke around and

73
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,300
see what they can find so so before we

74
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,370
get to that part we need to take a

75
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,310
couple detours and that's really we need

76
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:59,920
to go to the beginning or near the

77
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,840
beginning and talk about how we came to

78
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,820
be with the darknet and these darknet

79
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,360
markets and the first one we really need

80
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:10,290
to talk about is Silk Road so as many of

81
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,430
you probably remember Silk Road was

82
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,459
probably the first massively successful

83
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:19,300
dark net market out there it was founded

84
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:23,140
in 2011 by Ross Ulbricht who's now in

85
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:25,210
custody and he was trying to he's very

86
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,559
much a libertarian mindset so they had

87
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,360
these these you know the philosophy of

88
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,340
agar ISM and counter economics and all

89
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,200
these fancy terms like he was out there

90
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,330
saying listen you can you can come to

91
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,399
these markets and get the goods and

92
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,380
services you want without the government

93
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,250
interfering in your business and they

94
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,900
shouldn't they don't have any business

95
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,900
in there anyway so I'm gonna provide

96
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,610
that service for you as a you know as a

97
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,480
person who's looking out for you right

98
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,750
that that's kind of the whole idea

99
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,489
behind algorithmic counter economics and

100
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,050
Silk Road it wasn't the first darknet

101
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,180
market out there but it was the

102
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:58,690
certainly it was the first one to gain a

103
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,280
lot of popularity within the the

104
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,380
customer base if you will the people

105
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,350
that were going around the dark web and

106
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:08,230
it actually helped to sort of guide and

107
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:12,519
provide a blueprint for how a lot of the

108
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:15,459
markets then on performed architected

109
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,410
themselves and one of the things that it

110
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:19,540
did was it adopted it was a very early

111
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,820
adopter of the escrow system and I'll

112
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,350
talk a bit about that in a minute and it

113
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,120
also introduced something called the

114
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,160
vendor reputation system so you know

115
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,960
we're very familiar at least on the

116
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,760
defender side about reputation right so

117
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,440
URL reputation those kinds of things

118
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,870
they were doing the same sort of idea

119
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,830
with with vendors on the dark web in

120
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:41,770
those days and one pretty notable aspect

121
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:45,219
of Silk Road was the policy that only

122
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,840
goods and services which didn't harm or

123
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,330
defraud and that was in the terms of

124
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,770
service were allowed on the site so you

125
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,258
know this applied to things like child

126
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,270
sexual exploitation material services

127
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,669
based on violence of any kind and goods

128
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,650
used to like aid and abet fraud right so

129
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:00,639
carding services stolen identities those

130
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,710
kinds of things so those were not

131
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,319
allowed now it wasn't always the case

132
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,419
obviously some stuff snuck onto the

133
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:09,310
market from time to time but at least

134
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:12,310
that's what the Terms of Service stated

135
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,169
and in keeping with that libertarian

136
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,400
ethos of do no harm to others you know

137
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:17,770
you can do all the harm you want to

138
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,900
yourself but do no harm to others it

139
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,849
focused mostly on drugs and drug

140
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:25,090
paraphernalia that was a sight sort of

141
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:27,130
reason for being and there weren't only

142
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,080
illegal goods available on Silk Road at

143
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:33,130
the time you had things like jewelry

144
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,508
books artwork sports memorabilia and war

145
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,120
memorabilia as well as it gets in the

146
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:42,840
replicas for some war memorabilia here

147
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:44,889
as well and what what Silk Road also

148
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:49,948
what it also brought to the table was

149
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:52,539
this this the helping bring Bitcoin to

150
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:55,120
popularity if you will right so before

151
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:56,710
then a lot of the markets were and

152
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,659
there's one called the farmers market

153
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,520
which was around just before Silk Road

154
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:03,759
it actually transacted in PayPal and

155
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,650
Western Union and that's actually what

156
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,500
led to its downfall and if you look at

157
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:10,750
some of the other the other takedowns of

158
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,190
things like fake AV and the police

159
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,770
lockers you know they were also using

160
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:17,229
sort of more common payment methods and

161
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,969
and by following the money it's easier

162
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:20,849
for the the feds and law enforcement to

163
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:24,039
basically find out who these people are

164
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:25,840
but Silk Road was the early adopter of

165
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:29,169
Bitcoin and it was Bitcoin only at the

166
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,659
time and the large transaction volume

167
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:33,430
that was happening at on the unsold

168
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:35,469
market at the time helped actually pump

169
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:38,020
up the Bitcoin price and then if we look

170
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:40,719
at the the chart here which is right

171
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,490
over here in the middle as when Silk

172
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:44,529
Road was seized and you can see there's

173
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:48,550
been a there was a you know a brief but

174
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:49,779
very sharp drop in Bitcoin value on that

175
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,639
day and that was just because there was

176
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:53,469
you know this massive volatility in the

177
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:55,319
market all of a sudden and then Bitcoin

178
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:58,439
plunged now

179
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:01,860
it wasn't very long lived Bitcoin price

180
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:05,729
it recovered but it didn't take long for

181
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,680
other people other criminals to realize

182
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:08,998
like this is a market that they want to

183
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,069
get in on this is you know they want to

184
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:13,020
be part of this action so the next thing

185
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:16,469
we need to talk about is how these dark

186
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,938
net markets actually work some of the

187
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,960
markets that are around today actually

188
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:21,569
most of the markets were around today

189
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,339
actually still follow the original ethos

190
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:25,050
of Silk Road you know they trade at

191
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:27,449
least they attempt to trade in only

192
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:29,249
drugs and drug paraphernalia

193
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,080
and anything that doesn't pose harm to

194
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:32,909
others you have some markets out there

195
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,339
that are all over the place but the

196
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:38,399
majority of the more popular markets

197
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:40,499
today they'll just sell about anything

198
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,779
to anyone they really don't care so

199
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:44,339
drugs weapons hacking services malware

200
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:46,308
counterfeit goods you name it the

201
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:50,219
murder-for-hire services some of them if

202
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:52,319
you know most of those are scams but the

203
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:54,360
only thing that most of these markets

204
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,419
still prohibit is anything to do with

205
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,219
child sexual exploitation and sometimes

206
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:02,188
murder they're a little bit vague on

207
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:05,729
that one but how do these things operate

208
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:06,870
so this is a government exhibit 113a

209
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:09,389
from the Ross Ulbricht

210
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,399
trial and it really gives us a good

211
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:13,349
clear picture about how these markets

212
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:16,019
operate so you've got vendors that have

213
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:18,149
a product they will place an ad on the

214
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:20,009
market and then you've got your buyers

215
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:21,120
on the left-hand side now the buyers the

216
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,589
first thing they need to do is they take

217
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,289
their real money and translate it to

218
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:27,240
fake money and then they go and browse

219
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:29,009
the dark web market for something they

220
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,719
want right so let's say it's drugs so

221
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,719
they'll go and find an ad they'll click

222
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:35,909
on the ad and then once they put in

223
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,250
their buy order they transfer some of

224
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:40,979
those bitcoins whatever the value of the

225
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,990
ad is the for that good into what's

226
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,600
called an escrow account now these

227
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,250
escrow accounts are how they they

228
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,810
attempt to build trust within these

229
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,339
markets so I'm not just going to give my

230
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,930
money directly to the person who's

231
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,060
selling me the drugs because he could

232
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,589
just take my money and run right so what

233
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,560
these escrow accounts do is they hold

234
00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:02,100
the money until the goods or services

235
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,560
have been delivered so until you can

236
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,750
signal to the market that yes I've

237
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,630
received what it is I'm looking for the

238
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,580
the vendor doesn't get any money

239
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,290
and where the markets themselves make

240
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,690
money is they just take a cut they take

241
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:16,579
a commission by brokering that

242
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,570
transaction in the middle and it's

243
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:22,100
usually somewhere from 2 to 6 percent so

244
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:24,080
that's really how they make their money

245
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,330
they just they're their facilitator and

246
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,240
they just take a cut along the way as

247
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:31,280
the goods and services flow through now

248
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:35,510
there's other ways of making money as

249
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,850
well they're actually rules if you want

250
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:40,310
to become a vendor on a darkweb market

251
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,440
and you've got to follow them and you

252
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:44,599
know there's the usual rules

253
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,020
specifically around things like those

254
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,060
child sexual exploitation material

255
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:52,250
murder-for-hire vers services and also

256
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,719
no doxxing that's that's a big one for

257
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,740
which is kind of funny on the on the

258
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,840
dark web you know everything's supposed

259
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,730
to be anonymous in private and so these

260
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,560
dark web markets like they go if you

261
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:03,170
dock somebody if you reveal somebody's

262
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,780
home address and their private details

263
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:08,209
you're pretty much banned from any

264
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:11,060
markets for life until you get another

265
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:13,910
identity and get back in there again and

266
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,050
then Empire which is one of the markets

267
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,569
that's out there right now actually

268
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,339
charges a fee to get on so there's a

269
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,830
vendor bond you can see sore underline

270
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,650
there's $300 which is non-refundable

271
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:26,750
so Empire market they just say basically

272
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,890
we want only serious vendors on here so

273
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,560
you got to put a little skin in the game

274
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:33,410
$300 not that much but they're trying to

275
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,300
keep scammers away and for them you know

276
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,819
securities is a top priority like you

277
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,130
have to have a PGP key and you must

278
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,140
enable 2fa on your accounts on the

279
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,850
market if you want to become a vendor so

280
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,890
they're doing that not only to protect

281
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,990
themselves but really to protect the

282
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:51,380
buyers that are coming to these dark net

283
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,670
markets and you know that night begs the

284
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,500
question like could you imagine if like

285
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,420
Facebook and some of these of his social

286
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,960
services had these kinds of rules as

287
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:01,250
well we might be in a better place

288
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,590
there's another market out there right

289
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:07,340
now called nightmare and they have very

290
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:09,800
similar rules the only charge a two

291
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:12,200
hundred and fifty dollar bond for new

292
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,650
vendors but they actually they will

293
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:18,290
refund that fee after three months if

294
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:20,270
you've got some what they call a 100

295
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:22,130
percent fair dealing rating so if nobody

296
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,550
complains about your service you haven't

297
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,839
dust

298
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,060
anybody you've delivered all your goods

299
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,450
on time and it's the right amount then

300
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:31,310
they will refund that $250 but the

301
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,110
number one rule for this particular

302
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,939
market though is that there's no

303
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,519
shenanigans against Russian citizens so

304
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,200
number one at the very top and they feel

305
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,570
really adamant about this because they

306
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,310
actually mentioned it twice right so I

307
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:47,060
wonder where these guys are operating

308
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:49,130
out of and then finally there's you know

309
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,849
other creative ways that some of these

310
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:55,490
markets generate funds this is from

311
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:57,500
empire market it used to operate it's no

312
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,790
longer the the lottery it used to

313
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,440
operates no longer around but basically

314
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,510
it was just that it was a lottery you

315
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,579
buy the equivalent of one u.s. dollar

316
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,050
through bitcoins you get into the

317
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:07,609
lottery and then you take a chance at

318
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,920
winning at the time was 8k for the

319
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,410
jackpot right and that's just that it

320
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,610
was just a money-making scheme and and I

321
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,110
don't know why they took it down this

322
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,480
there's never been any sort of you know

323
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:22,160
blog post about it but it doesn't

324
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,660
operate anymore all right so why do

325
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,949
these things get shut down why do they

326
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:29,930
come and go this is a an eye chart I get

327
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:33,560
it but the colors are what we're looking

328
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:36,589
for here so this is 87 markets that were

329
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:39,439
tracked over six years and the colored

330
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:41,930
bar indicates why it was shut down and

331
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,339
then the life of the bar indicates the

332
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,949
length of time that it operated right so

333
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:47,779
I've drawn some some lines that to just

334
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,950
connect them for you it doesn't matter

335
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:51,529
it I'll tell you where the nibs are in

336
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,970
left hand side here but basically at the

337
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:55,130
top of the chart we can see at the very

338
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,370
top of the chart we can see Silk Road no

339
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,810
Silk Road one which is in green and

340
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:03,649
green means that it was taken down by

341
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,819
law enforcement so that means any kind

342
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,560
of law enforcement action is going to

343
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,270
get coded green in this chart and then

344
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,670
after that you see something called

345
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:12,699
black market reloaded which is very the

346
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:15,380
very next line which is coated in gold

347
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:17,000
and that means that they allegedly

348
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,800
suffered some sort of a hack and then

349
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,329
force them to take it down and you see

350
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,370
that from time to time and there's a big

351
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:23,779
DDoS thing happening on on tour right

352
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,250
now with a lot of these markets and

353
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:26,390
sometimes the markets just kind of go

354
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,820
away because they can't be bothered to

355
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,130
deal with this kind of stuff and then

356
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:33,470
sheep market which is again the next one

357
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:36,439
down which is in blue that means they

358
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:38,720
exit scammed so and

359
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,040
exit scam is where the administrators of

360
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,780
the market we talked about that escrow

361
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,130
account where all the funds go into it

362
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:46,250
right and they don't get released until

363
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:48,320
this the buy order has been satisfied an

364
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,760
exit scan is very simply where the the

365
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,260
administrators of the market go thank

366
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,770
you very much and walk away with all the

367
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:57,140
funds and this happens quite often and

368
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:58,880
you know it's happened quite a few times

369
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:02,180
in the last sort of six years where

370
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,410
markets just just take your money and

371
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,819
run why not I mean these are criminals

372
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:08,810
right they're operating a criminal

373
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:11,390
enterprise so in the in the case of

374
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,829
these guys they took off with six

375
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,060
million dollars right so depending on

376
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,500
the size of the market and the amount of

377
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,000
transaction volume that's going into

378
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,310
that escrow account it depends on how

379
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,500
much stuff you can have in there and

380
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:23,869
then shortly after Silk Road one was

381
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,210
raided there was a Silk Road - that

382
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,700
opened up shop because it was it was

383
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:30,920
opened up by a moderator of the former

384
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,050
Silk Road one and they were just using

385
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,579
the term for marketing purposes right

386
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,990
everybody knew who Silk Road was it was

387
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,360
all over the news so they thought I will

388
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,860
just use that and it lasted about a year

389
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,980
before a law enforcement took them down

390
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:45,890
and then the pinky purple one is for

391
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,200
markets that voluntarily shut down so in

392
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,210
contrast to things like exit scams right

393
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,560
these guys actually they decided to shut

394
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,300
down for whatever reason maybe that

395
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,270
maybe the feds were knocking at their

396
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,229
door or they were getting too close and

397
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:59,420
what they do is they'll put it they'll

398
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,130
post a message on their on their market

399
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,800
saying we are going to be shutting down

400
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:06,200
we're gonna give you a week to take your

401
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,870
funds out of escrow both the the vendors

402
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,300
and the buyers right and everybody kind

403
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,310
of walks away with with all their money

404
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,740
and their reputation intact if you will

405
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:17,660
and Agora was one of these markets and

406
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,730
then finally there's evolution which is

407
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,339
the last line that I've highlighted here

408
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:24,230
in blue again and they exit scam to the

409
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:26,570
tune of twelve million dollars so you

410
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,980
can see as as time goes on these markets

411
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,870
are gaining more traction more

412
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,450
popularity and more transaction volume

413
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,670
and Agora and evolution we're in their

414
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:38,780
time two of the biggest and most popular

415
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:42,199
markets on the dark web and just as with

416
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:45,380
nature which pours a vacuum the dark web

417
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,870
also follows that same ethos so when

418
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,480
when evolution and the gora went away

419
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,920
there was

420
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,750
you needed you needed something to take

421
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,229
its place and this is really the moment

422
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:58,350
that alpha Bay was waiting for in the

423
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:01,810
three days following evolutions closure

424
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:04,420
alpha Bay gained 18,000 new members and

425
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:06,910
it was soon trading about 300 thousand

426
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:09,969
dollars a day so it was really ramping

427
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:11,769
up and taking a lot of the the customers

428
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,079
away from from these other markets and

429
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:16,029
it was like a lot of the the new Marta

430
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,930
that you know all the other newer newer

431
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:19,870
markets out there

432
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:21,699
I dealt in drugs but you could also get

433
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,500
yourself digital goods like you know

434
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:24,760
these compromised airmiles accounts if

435
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,769
you've ever wondered like if you get

436
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,750
fish for your Delta SkyMiles account

437
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:30,100
where it goes it very much ends up in

438
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,070
places like this not all the time but

439
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,720
this is a good place for it and then you

440
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:37,269
know you got luxury goods like all these

441
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,560
years ease now when I was doing this

442
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:44,139
research old guy had no idea what it was

443
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,689
you shaking yeah you nodding but anyways

444
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:48,880
apparently sneakers so but because of

445
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,160
the explosive growth of this particular

446
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,990
market I started drawing a lot of

447
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,910
law-enforcement attention right they saw

448
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:57,850
this flood of people going to this

449
00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:00,100
market and because of the amount of

450
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,949
drugs that were transacting it really

451
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,449
needed to be shut down and so the cops

452
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:07,688
kind of went to work and said I we need

453
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:09,579
to figure out who this person is or

454
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:11,949
these people are that are behind this

455
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:13,629
alpha Bay market and there were mentions

456
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:15,610
all over the site if you if you dug

457
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,530
through you know view source and other

458
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:19,569
places in the market that it was founded

459
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:22,928
designed and maintained by an individual

460
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:24,909
by the name of alpha 0 to alpha 0 2 also

461
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:26,620
did an interview with a website called

462
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,169
deep web where he admitted to being the

463
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:31,540
site's founder and owner and so the cops

464
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:32,830
now had a target you know alpha 0-2 but

465
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,309
they really didn't know who the

466
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:38,740
real-life identity of that person was so

467
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:40,450
they started buying drugs from the

468
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,280
market trying to think about what they

469
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,780
could deduce from any of the shipments

470
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,389
or the transactions right so they

471
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:48,160
ordered some marijuana and some heroin

472
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:51,580
and then some more heroin and some more

473
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,620
marijuana and some meth as well and then

474
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,530
they had some stolen driver's licenses

475
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:58,059
they ordered some ATM skimmer stuff but

476
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,500
nothing came out of all this they

477
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:02,200
couldn't really get any kind of clues

478
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,830
and it wasn't until they decide to

479
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,290
register and

480
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:07,389
count on the discussion forum that they

481
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,980
caught a break now most of these markets

482
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,210
do have discussion forums that are

483
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,830
attached to them so they'll have the

484
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,750
main market and in the discussion forum

485
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:16,090
and generally you have to register for

486
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,460
both and so that's what they did is they

487
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:21,790
registered for an account now one of the

488
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:25,210
features of the signup process is that

489
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:27,340
as when you're creating an account yet

490
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,870
to provide an email address and this was

491
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,550
for password recovery so forgot my

492
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:33,729
password it would email you a link to

493
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:36,460
reset and then the system sent that

494
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:37,900
automated email in the headers of that

495
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,720
welcome email saying thank you for

496
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:43,570
registering there was an address so pimp

497
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,740
Alex 91 at hotmail.com so that was

498
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,570
included in the header so the feds

499
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,880
basically just called up Microsoft and

500
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:51,970
said hey who's this clown right and it

501
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,340
turned out that this was a Canadian one

502
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:57,100
of my fellow countrymen apparently named

503
00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:01,510
alexavic Oz whose birthdate was 19

504
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:04,300
October 1991 so if you look at it

505
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:06,550
LinkedIn profile it indicated that he

506
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,230
was a software designer based in Quebec

507
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:10,750
that worked for a company called EBX

508
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:13,150
technologies this is a company that the

509
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,820
law enforcement eventually learned he

510
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:17,830
actually owned and controlled and EBX

511
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:21,220
technologies was really just a front

512
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:23,830
company that he used to launder all the

513
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,120
Alpha Bay money through and if you look

514
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,830
because they started looking at things

515
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,659
like government taxation records and all

516
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,399
sorts of other financial things and the

517
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,620
the company wasn't particularly

518
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,950
productive or successful but it was very

519
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:38,459
good at laundering money so they also

520
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:41,110
found mentions of that hotmail address

521
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:44,530
and an EBX technologies address

522
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:45,850
associated with a PayPal account so what

523
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,440
would these are in case you're wondering

524
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,600
these are all just snippets from the

525
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,160
indictment of Alexandre cause and this

526
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,219
is or if you're doing research like this

527
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,710
this is a really good way to figure out

528
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,660
what you know how stuff went down

529
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,590
because law enforcement will really tell

530
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,880
you what's going on during an

531
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,110
investigation but when the indictment

532
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,690
comes out you can find out a lot of

533
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:06,580
information so so they found this PayPal

534
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,610
account and then if you dig even further

535
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:11,830
you find a post on a French computer

536
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:14,469
help form like a bleeping computer style

537
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,570
forum that was dedicated to French

538
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,799
French Canadians and French speak

539
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:23,350
people and there was a post by user

540
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:25,210
alpha0 - and this might have been a

541
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:27,399
coincidence right because anybody could

542
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,690
pick that username if it hadn't been for

543
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:29,080
the fact that he actually signed the

544
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,000
post

545
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,158
Alex alma cause and had his email

546
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,230
address pimp Alex 91 at hotmail calm at

547
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,240
the bottom of the post actually if you

548
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,769
go to this you can still find this post

549
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,690
today but for some reason the sites

550
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:43,419
actually scrubbed that last bit where he

551
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:46,450
signed his name for whatever reason and

552
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:47,919
then if you do like most people when you

553
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:50,259
get an email address to go check have I

554
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,870
been poned right and of course his

555
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:54,429
address was leaked all over the place

556
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,408
just like the rest of our addresses

557
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:59,080
right so it was in the LinkedIn breach

558
00:20:56,409 --> 00:21:00,549
as most of us are but it's also in

559
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,918
something called triple zero web host

560
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:04,360
which is a well-known repository for a

561
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:07,299
very shady web script so he was

562
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:10,029
community was participating in in that

563
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:11,408
community as well and no doubt probably

564
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:15,909
using it for some of these other side

565
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:17,440
gigs as well so I want to clean the deep

566
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:18,789
top web interview that I mentioned

567
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,039
earlier he actually bragged about his

568
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:23,080
obstet right I am absolutely certain

569
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,539
that my OPSEC is secure and I live in an

570
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,879
offshore country where I'm safe hubris

571
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:29,440
will always take you down so at this

572
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:32,049
point the feds you know they they had

573
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,500
the individual in question it was just

574
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:36,580
now time to take him down around that

575
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,730
same time period there was another

576
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:42,580
market called Hansa which was getting a

577
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:44,200
lot of attention both from the users

578
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,149
basically you know the amount of

579
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,690
popularity it had if you will and again

580
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:51,399
law enforcement and like Alpha Bane and

581
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,710
again many of the other markets out

582
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:55,870
there it dealt with all sorts of illegal

583
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:58,750
goods and services drugs counterfeit

584
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:00,399
items stolen digital information like

585
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,990
the Netflix accounts again if you're

586
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:04,299
ever wondering where your fish Spotify

587
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:08,590
Netflix account end up it's over here

588
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:10,418
and and one day in late 2016 a security

589
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:13,379
researcher was kind of trolling around

590
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:15,610
the web and found something interesting

591
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:17,678
they found a server on the clear web

592
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:20,889
that had that appeared to be a

593
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,990
development server for the Hanson market

594
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:25,029
okay so that's interesting so the

595
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,440
researcher then looked at the IP address

596
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:28,299
and it looked like he was located in

597
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,000
Netherlands so he notified the Dutch

598
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:32,679
police and they

599
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,929
getting to work now the Dutch high-tech

600
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:37,780
Crimes Unit or HTC you might hear me say

601
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:39,460
that they quickly got a warrant went to

602
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,039
the data center install the network tap

603
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:44,289
and they wanted to see the traffic that

604
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:46,419
was coming to and from this server and

605
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:48,039
to their surprise they found that the

606
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:50,260
the development server was actually

607
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:52,658
really really chatty it was

608
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:56,679
communicating with tor protected servers

609
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:58,809
in the same data center as as that was

610
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:00,190
hosting the Hanson live site as well so

611
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:02,110
we're starting to see some OPSEC

612
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:05,650
breakdowns here and also a couple of

613
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:08,020
other servers in Germany so the HTC you

614
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,070
immediately made a copy of all of these

615
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,129
servers all the ones that could get

616
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:14,559
their hands on and what was on those

617
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:16,990
servers was every transaction record and

618
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,730
that the site had ever done to that

619
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,400
point and the entire conversation

620
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:24,400
history of the anonymized chat system

621
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,539
and since all the conversations in in

622
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,850
those chat systems usually use

623
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:29,950
pseudonyms it wasn't really possible to

624
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:32,080
determine exactly who all the

625
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:35,020
individuals were in real life that were

626
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,389
chatting but again I mean OPSEC mistakes

627
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,250
will always take you down and so in one

628
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,570
very old chat log as they were scrolling

629
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:44,350
towards the bottom they found both

630
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:46,870
admins full names like legitimate names

631
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:49,629
and the home address of one of these

632
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:50,709
guys so they went to the German

633
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,120
authorities because they had a couple

634
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:54,280
servers in there and these were German

635
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,750
individuals and they said hey we need to

636
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,908
have these guys arrested and extradited

637
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,919
and the Germans said hey we know who

638
00:23:57,909 --> 00:24:00,669
those guys are

639
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:02,530
apparently it turns out that they were

640
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:04,750
already under investigation by the

641
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:07,299
German authorities for running a site

642
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:08,770
that was called Lu LTO and this was

643
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:12,580
basically selling pirated ebooks

644
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:14,590
audiobooks and mp3s and when the the

645
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:17,080
Dutch police found they said they said

646
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:19,899
Wow okay well maybe we can use the

647
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,539
arrest of these guys for Lu LTO to kind

648
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:25,630
of spring a trap for another operation

649
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:27,039
that we're thinking about and it was

650
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,630
unfortunately at this time the Dutch

651
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,490
we're just getting ready to put this

652
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:33,850
whole operation into motion that

653
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:36,100
everything went dark all communication

654
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:40,719
stopped now the assumption here is that

655
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:43,209
the people behind this particular set of

656
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,190
servers this particular operation this

657
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,020
market

658
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,910
they had noticed something funny going

659
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,430
on they noticed the hard drive copy or

660
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:53,550
they they noticed something that wasn't

661
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:55,590
quite right and so they basically turned

662
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:58,440
everything off and then moved their

663
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:01,020
servers elsewhere so now there's kind of

664
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,460
left the HTC you with nothing they they

665
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,310
didn't know where these guys had gone

666
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,750
and it was basically back to analyzing

667
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:09,419
what they had which was the transaction

668
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:11,130
records and the chat logs and luckily

669
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:13,590
you know as they were going through the

670
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:16,320
chat logs they found in an April place

671
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:20,129
17 they found a Bitcoin wallet that was

672
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,899
buried in one of the chats using some

673
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:24,780
blockchain analysis they found that this

674
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,400
Bitcoin wallet was they found that the

675
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:31,139
payment was made through a provider that

676
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:33,600
was located in the Netherlands to to

677
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,670
another provider in Lithuania and so

678
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,219
they got a warrant issued they went to

679
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:39,900
lift-away India and basically they found

680
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,490
the Hansa servers once again so this is

681
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:44,550
actually one of the servers in the racks

682
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:46,680
okay so now they they got the people

683
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:49,889
again and this sort of big break okay we

684
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:52,320
can carry on with our operation and at

685
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:53,640
this time the FBI came over and notified

686
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,439
the HTC you because a lot of these guys

687
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,270
work together in the backend that they

688
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,340
had also found this servers hosting

689
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:01,379
alpha bay so you've got the Dutch

690
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,240
they've got control of Hanser at least

691
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,550
they know where Hansa is and then now

692
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,680
you've got the FBI saying we know who

693
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:10,379
alpha bay is who the founder is and who

694
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:12,630
the operator is and so they were

695
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,070
planning to take alpha Bay down and they

696
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:16,710
were just notifying the Dutch as a

697
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:19,830
courtesy and this gave the Dutch another

698
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:23,670
idea they figured that if alpha bay went

699
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:24,870
down then as happened many times in the

700
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:26,400
past with all the other markets you know

701
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:28,409
the users will flood somewhere else and

702
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,420
the likely destination for these guys

703
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:33,690
was the hanson market because hanson was

704
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:35,940
number 2 alpha bay was number 1 so on 20

705
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:40,560
June 2017 the Dutch police sent a couple

706
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:43,680
of agents to Lithuania and the Germans

707
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:46,260
sent the police to the homes of the two

708
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,640
individuals that were running the hanson

709
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,550
market and basically know in a very

710
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,950
coordinated Donst dawn raid they

711
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:54,450
basically broke into the the homes of

712
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,820
these two guys busted down the doors as

713
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:59,650
the the guys in Lithuania were

714
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:02,050
doing hard drive copies of those servers

715
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:03,070
and it turns out that under questioning

716
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,389
once these got you know they got the

717
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,980
police station they basically just

718
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:08,590
handed over all the credentials all the

719
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:13,030
PGP keys yeah it's us you know how about

720
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:14,740
it and the interesting thing was there

721
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:16,570
was a zero down time for any of this

722
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,400
because the cops

723
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,260
the Dutch cops had taken a copy of that

724
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,630
server and then spun it up immediately

725
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,100
in a Dutch data center that they

726
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:27,930
controlled and then did the cutover

727
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:30,639
without anybody noticing and that's when

728
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:33,670
the all the pieces for operation bayonet

729
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,520
was born and I'm 5 July 2017 the FBI

730
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:40,150
with the help of authorities in Canada

731
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,650
and Thailand they shut down alphabet now

732
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,610
the Canadian authorities took down the

733
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:44,620
service because they were actually being

734
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,929
hosted in Montreal at the time and the

735
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:49,750
Thai police went and arrested Alexandre

736
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:51,280
cos at his residence in Bangkok so this

737
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:53,440
is a picture of us one of his homes now

738
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,480
the Thai police this was interesting

739
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,330
they they they used an unmarked car to

740
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,700
stage a disturbance outside of his

741
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:03,189
residence what they did was they backed

742
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,740
his this car up into his like front gate

743
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:07,420
and hoping that he would notice that

744
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,980
something had happened out in the street

745
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:12,340
and then he would come outside because

746
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:13,630
they needed to get him and nothing

747
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,310
happened so then they had some other

748
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:17,230
undercover officers you know shouting in

749
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:19,120
Thai and making a commotion they moved

750
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,920
the currently randon and gate again and

751
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,949
eventually there was enough commotion

752
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,480
that he came running out of his house to

753
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:28,600
discover you have to figure out what's

754
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,950
going on and that's when they swooped in

755
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,389
basically tackled him to the ground he

756
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:33,040
had his apparel he was talking on the

757
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,510
phone and he was shirtless wearing

758
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,330
flip-flops they talked only grabbed his

759
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:39,970
phone they ran upstairs and when they

760
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:42,100
got to his computer he was actually the

761
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,630
session was open and unlocked and he was

762
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,860
logged into the Alpha Bay servers

763
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,390
because he was trying to figure out what

764
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,399
the heck is going on because his servers

765
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:51,730
were starting to come down so they kind

766
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,780
of had him red-handed and I mean well in

767
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,190
the Netherlands this is where it gets

768
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,750
really fun and interesting is the Dutch

769
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:59,530
police were fiddling with all the code

770
00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:02,140
on Hansa they rewrote the site's code so

771
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:04,690
that it would no longer store the

772
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:07,150
passwords of users in hashes but at just

773
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,860
plain text so they were able to do you

774
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:10,180
know basically get all the passwords

775
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,070
they could get their hands on that way

776
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,570
every

777
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:15,450
time you logged in that would get your

778
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:16,678
password they also made a mess change to

779
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:20,460
the messaging system the encrypted

780
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:22,169
messaging systems so that all before all

781
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,549
the messages went into the encrypted

782
00:29:22,169 --> 00:29:25,740
part of the system they would just take

783
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:28,009
a copy a plaintext copy so again they

784
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,809
could see all the identities they also

785
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:32,130
messed with a code that that stripped

786
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:33,899
out all the metadata from photos so

787
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:35,759
every time somebody uploaded a photo

788
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:38,518
event or uploaded a photo of their drugs

789
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,470
or their illicit goods or whatever they

790
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:41,880
the system would strip out the metadata

791
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,529
all the geolocation that kind of stuff

792
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,000
well they changed that so they would

793
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:47,309
keep that in they actually staged the

794
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,929
server glitch forcing resellers they

795
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:50,070
basically took down all the pictures so

796
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:51,779
though we had a server glitch we lost

797
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:54,090
all the images can you reload stuff

798
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:55,440
after they turned off that metadata

799
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,970
stripping functions and now they were

800
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,259
able to because of that they could they

801
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,480
could get you know the basically the

802
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:02,340
coordinates of 50 dealers that were

803
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,110
reloading their pictures and then they

804
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:07,049
also tricked a bunch of these vendors

805
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:11,100
into downloading and Excel off this an

806
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:12,840
excel file that was booby-trapped and it

807
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,850
was posing as a backup key for their

808
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,439
accounts and so when they brought that

809
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:19,289
file in and opened it up what it

810
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,940
actually did was just it pinged home but

811
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:23,179
through their clear net addresses as

812
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,860
opposed to their you know tour protected

813
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:28,590
circuits and this got them another 64

814
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:31,168
targets so shutting down alpha bay

815
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:34,019
actually had the desired effect more

816
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:36,690
than 5,000 users were registering on

817
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:39,929
hands to every single day after Hansa

818
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:41,789
was shut down and a week later once the

819
00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:45,509
news broke that alpha bay actually was

820
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:48,480
taken down by the police the influx of

821
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:49,919
users was so much on Hansa that they

822
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,960
actually had to shut down new

823
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,090
registration so I was actually just

824
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,889
doing my rounds and you know let's see

825
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:57,149
what's on handset today and I saw this

826
00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:58,439
I'm like oh that's interesting they're

827
00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:01,110
shutting down registration I wonder what

828
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,789
that's about and as a person not part of

829
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,590
law enforcement I didn't know that it

830
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:07,889
was being controlled by law enforcement

831
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:09,928
at the time now and the reason they did

832
00:31:07,889 --> 00:31:13,049
this was because unfortunately a Dutch

833
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:15,629
law states that you have to track and

834
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:19,080
report every single transaction that

835
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:21,570
goes through hand seller or any kind of

836
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,129
you know where these sting operations if

837
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,820
you're operating in the legal market or

838
00:31:23,129 --> 00:31:25,899
an illegal venture you have to try

839
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,870
and report everything that goes through

840
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:31,030
it and these guys we're dealing with a

841
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:32,199
thousand transactions a day minimum so

842
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:34,899
they had to do the paperwork on a

843
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,610
thousand transactions and after like 27

844
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,930
days they just couldn't manage it

845
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:41,110
anymore so they had to shut the site

846
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:43,450
down so that's when you know we got the

847
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:47,439
the takedown notice for Hansel and the

848
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:50,020
the results were fairly staggering you

849
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,300
the police obtained data on about four

850
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:54,639
hundred and twenty thousand users of the

851
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,440
the combined sites if you will

852
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,900
including a hundred thousand home

853
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,520
addresses of real-life people that they

854
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,020
were both buyers and sellers and they

855
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,490
basically just turned all this over to

856
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,490
Europol and other law enforcement

857
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:08,500
agencies worldwide and they also seized

858
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:10,480
about twelve million dollars worth of

859
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,460
bitcoins in the escrow accounts at that

860
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,410
time they actually did a bunch of what

861
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,900
they call knockin talks at that time so

862
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:18,190
basically they because they got people's

863
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,540
home addresses people that maybe had

864
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,280
ordered drugs they kind of went over

865
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,570
there and said hey we know you ordered

866
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,190
something cut it out

867
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:27,220
we're not gonna press charges but stop

868
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:28,660
it and by the time it was seized alpha

869
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,550
BAE had over a hundred three hundred

870
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,900
seventy thousand listings four hundred

871
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:34,030
thousand members and was trading about

872
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:36,760
six to eight hundred thousand dollars a

873
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:38,410
day so a really big operation now in its

874
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,000
heyday Silk Road just for comparison had

875
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:42,430
only 13 thousand listings and these guys

876
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,320
had three hundred seventy thousand and

877
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:46,570
it's estimated that alpha grossed about

878
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,760
1 billion dollars in roughly the two

879
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:50,679
years that was in operation which

880
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:53,230
basically was funding a good life for

881
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,360
Alexander cause this is and the

882
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:57,190
forfeiture document you can find out all

883
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,169
the stuff that he amassed and this is

884
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:00,640
one of his luxury villas in Thailand

885
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:03,280
which you could actually stay at for a

886
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,960
time if you go to the rental agencies

887
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,720
now this is not available for rent

888
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,430
anymore but basically he was buying

889
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,540
luxury properties all over the world and

890
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,670
he was trying to become an economic

891
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:15,070
citizen in many countries which is

892
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:17,200
basically if you buy a certain amount of

893
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:19,570
property or real estate in a country

894
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,220
then they will give you a passport and

895
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:24,700
so he was doing that and select

896
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:26,710
locations around the world if only he

897
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,150
had been at that earlier talk that I was

898
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:30,550
talking about becoming a darknet

899
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:31,630
criminal he would realize that he

900
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,710
shouldn't have gone to any of the blue

901
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,510
countries because those are the ones

902
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:37,930
that have extradition treaties with the

903
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:38,710
US in addition to his luxury properties

904
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:41,380
he had lots of

905
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:46,149
very fancy cars including this Aventador

906
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:49,120
LP 702 the Excel spreadsheet they found

907
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:50,799
on his computer was about 23 million

908
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,340
dollars so that's in property cash

909
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:56,139
bitcoin and all other assets now you

910
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:58,408
know this is this is all good news we

911
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:00,549
get to shut down some of these markets

912
00:33:58,409 --> 00:34:02,520
unfortunately the good news is quite

913
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:06,340
tainted because while he was waiting

914
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:08,379
extradition in to the u.s. in Thailand

915
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:10,659
he hung himself in his bangkok jail cell

916
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:12,190
so it's one of these cases where you

917
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:13,599
know he probably felt the weight of the

918
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:15,609
world crashing down on him and he

919
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,580
couldn't handle it and unfortunately he

920
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:20,290
took his own life

921
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:22,889
so with alpha Bay enhance agon it was

922
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:25,239
dreams turn to take the spotlight and

923
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:27,669
basically when those two markets went

924
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:30,339
away dream was number three it inherited

925
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:32,049
all of this information that all the

926
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:33,460
users and when I was starting to put

927
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:36,159
together the pitches we're talking about

928
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:37,300
how you know things happen I was doing

929
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,710
some research I was doing my regular

930
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,320
rounds and I saw this notice that

931
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:45,580
basically the market was shutting down

932
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:48,220
and that well that was it we didn't know

933
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:52,359
the the alleged owner and operator speed

934
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:55,060
stepper had I the rumor was that he

935
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:56,290
either been arrested or exit scam those

936
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:59,200
are basically the two things that

937
00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:00,490
happened on a darknet forum a bunch of

938
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,348
people vouched for him said no no take

939
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:06,189
him at his word he is just stepping away

940
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:07,930
for a minute and little red flag started

941
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:09,339
popping up because he wasn't PGP signing

942
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:11,740
his messages so again I thought well

943
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:13,000
maybe the law enforcement have him they

944
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:15,220
just don't have his you know they he

945
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,869
hasn't given up his password yet to this

946
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:20,500
PGP key so that's why they didn't sign

947
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:22,450
it but the site stayed up the only thing

948
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,580
was all the products were gone so if you

949
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:27,040
went to the site you could log in as I

950
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,480
did here but there were no more ads on

951
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,910
the site anymore you couldn't search for

952
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,099
anything now apparently you could still

953
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:34,990
withdraw your bitcoins from the escrow

954
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:36,400
account at this point but some people

955
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:38,439
were saying that there were some issues

956
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,980
with that as well so you know there was

957
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,599
a lot of there's just a lot of turmoil

958
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:46,410
and people weren't sure what was going

959
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,280
on and then 30 April came and went and

960
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:51,399
basically the site was still showing the

961
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,600
same message and then in May there was a

962
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,460
post on reddit

963
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:58,089
which is basically reddit for the dark

964
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:59,200
web that basically said they were trying

965
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:02,410
to set the record straight what they

966
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,319
said was is that the market had been

967
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,910
under sustained DDoS attack and that the

968
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,670
attackers were demanding a four hundred

969
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:11,140
thousand dollar ransom and this is not

970
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,640
new I've mentioned it earlier DDoS

971
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,440
because of the way the protocol works

972
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,799
you can actually launch edocs attack

973
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:20,020
fairly effectively to the point that the

974
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,070
people behind some of these markets a

975
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:23,730
lot of cyber criminals that are

976
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:26,680
operating here actually are funding

977
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:29,170
their funding the one basically CVE the

978
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:32,200
one you know the the the the bug tracker

979
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:33,940
code that is gonna fix this they start

980
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:37,270
piling a whole bunch of money and

981
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,620
begging the tor project to fix it but so

982
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:40,540
it's a systemic issue but basically

983
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,490
instead of giving up and paying the

984
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,630
ransom they just said we're gonna shut

985
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,490
down and prove the code we're gonna

986
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,600
harden it and then we're gonna make it

987
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:49,419
you know bigger and better than before

988
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,830
and then another notice happened right

989
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,510
after that saying okay we're gonna come

990
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:55,060
back in August with new infrastructure

991
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:57,570
and another post on dredit confirmed

992
00:36:55,060 --> 00:37:00,190
that this was going to be the case and

993
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:01,660
as of now all the mirrors are gone and

994
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:03,850
we don't know what that happened dream

995
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,930
and it's still well I shouldn't kind of

996
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,310
know what happened to dream there's

997
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:09,100
another market called samsara that

998
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:12,279
opened up just very recently which we

999
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:14,290
all assume is where dream infrastructure

1000
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,340
moved to but basically at the time when

1001
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,570
I was looking at this I was like I was

1002
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:19,570
going to talk all about dream and how it

1003
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:22,210
got taken down and I had nothing and

1004
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:24,160
then I was just again doing the rounds

1005
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:26,140
and I saw something really interesting

1006
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,029
valhalla and Wall Street Market were

1007
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,620
both taking down the German National

1008
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:31,660
Police took down Wall Street Market

1009
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:33,850
finished customs and French police took

1010
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:35,620
down Valhalla so Wall Street Market in

1011
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:37,180
Valhalla now were the up and comers in

1012
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,890
the darknet market world you can see how

1013
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:41,440
this just keeps moving from one market

1014
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:43,150
to the next as people are being shut

1015
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,790
down moving around and exit scamming and

1016
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:49,330
this really rocked the dark web

1017
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:51,009
community because again these these

1018
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:54,250
markets the biggest most popular ones

1019
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:56,290
were being seized and only five days

1020
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:58,270
later after those two seizures occurred

1021
00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:00,790
the FBI didn't want to be left out of

1022
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:03,400
the fun so they seized a very popular

1023
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:04,630
dark web news site called Deep Web now

1024
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,830
it was easy to understand why Wall

1025
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,370
Street invalid how I got taken down

1026
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,410
because they were

1027
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:11,049
markets but what's the deal with the dot

1028
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:12,670
web well prior to being shut down it was

1029
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:15,520
a new site that dealt with all things

1030
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:19,540
dark web and it focused a lot on dark

1031
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:21,160
web or darknet market activity it wasn't

1032
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:23,680
just a new site but it also kind of

1033
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,850
served as a portal to dark net market so

1034
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,460
if you look on the right-hand side

1035
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:29,080
that's just basically a status of all of

1036
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:31,330
the popular markets and their

1037
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,220
availability at the time and then it

1038
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:35,920
also had referral links so this was for

1039
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:38,200
dream markets specifically for each of

1040
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,660
these markets and so this was the bridge

1041
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,069
between if you didn't know you know how

1042
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,990
to get on a dark web market you'd go

1043
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,310
here first and then it would tell you

1044
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,810
what's the onion link and how you get on

1045
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:49,750
and all this kind of thing but these

1046
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:51,940
referral links as you can see with the

1047
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:54,340
well you can't see but it says AI equals

1048
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:57,430
1675 that was their vendor ID if you all

1049
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:59,410
the referral ID what it doesn't explain

1050
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:01,569
though is okay why did they take down

1051
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:03,520
Deep Web because it was just a new site

1052
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:05,290
and yeah it pointed to the dark web but

1053
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,390
it kind of left a lot of us kind of

1054
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:09,940
scratching our heads now as part of the

1055
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:11,830
press release the FBI published this

1056
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,410
really handy infographic which explains

1057
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:15,900
exactly how deep dot web was implicated

1058
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:19,060
and why all this stuff was illegal so

1059
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,350
the admins would create an account on

1060
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:23,529
each of the sites that they were

1061
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:25,270
monitoring and representing and then

1062
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,340
they would publish their referral links

1063
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:29,500
every time you open an account you get a

1064
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:30,520
referral link I have many of them from

1065
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,200
all the accounts that I have on these

1066
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,070
dark net markets and then what they

1067
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,569
would do is they would take that

1068
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,850
referral like as we just saw put it out

1069
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:39,310
in their clear web site and so if you as

1070
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:40,960
a user use that referral link to then

1071
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:43,390
create your own account on the dark web

1072
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,860
on that particular market what they

1073
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:46,900
would then do is they would receive a

1074
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:52,050
cut of all the transactions that you

1075
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:54,430
ever did in perpetuity so now we have

1076
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:56,050
basically the link right so they're

1077
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:58,690
receiving what they believe they call

1078
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:00,700
proceeds of crime from this referral

1079
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:02,020
activity and then finally they would

1080
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,410
launder the stuff through shell

1081
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:07,030
companies that you know they were using

1082
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:09,420
to take their bitcoins and translate it

1083
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:13,540
back to real money so according to the

1084
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:16,150
indictment of Deep Web the referral link

1085
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:19,960
was associated with about 24% of all

1086
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:20,230
alpha BAE transactions and almost 50% so

1087
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,390
for

1088
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:24,730
7% of all handset transactions so they

1089
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:26,770
were doing a very brisk business they

1090
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:28,840
received over fifteen million dollars in

1091
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:31,090
kickbacks payments in total from all the

1092
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:34,750
various markets that they were they were

1093
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:36,070
referring and and and I think this is

1094
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:39,160
the first time that I like a clear

1095
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:41,140
website was actually taken down because

1096
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,410
of its association with with cyber

1097
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:46,420
criminals and dark web markets now

1098
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:48,609
interestingly there were a bunch of

1099
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,260
sites like Deep Web at the time which

1100
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:52,359
we're doing this exact same thing and

1101
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:54,790
most of them have since disappeared from

1102
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:58,600
be clear web so I guess you know they

1103
00:40:54,790 --> 00:41:02,020
learned their lesson so like many of the

1104
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:05,080
predecessors of of all these takedowns

1105
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:07,300
you know a slew of OPSEC mistakes were

1106
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,940
to blame for the takedowns of both Wall

1107
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,830
Street Market and Deep Web

1108
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:13,150
III there's not a lot of public

1109
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:14,680
information on the ballot how it's

1110
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:16,690
starting to come out I have since done a

1111
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,310
couple indictments on valhalla that are

1112
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,960
starting to explain how that happened

1113
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:22,720
but at the time we didn't have that

1114
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,280
information but you know it really

1115
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,069
doesn't take much to bring your whole

1116
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:30,670
criminal world crumbling down so the

1117
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:33,040
Deep Web indictment identified tell pre

1118
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:35,830
har and Michael fan as the admins of the

1119
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,440
site and basically the cops just again

1120
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:40,029
followed the money to identify these

1121
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,090
guys and just used a bit of open source

1122
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:45,160
intelligence and so by watching some

1123
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:47,080
wallets you know doing some blockchain

1124
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,940
analysis they were able to see how this

1125
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:51,460
money was being transferred between Deep

1126
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:54,000
Web and some of the other the other

1127
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:56,170
properties that these guys owned and

1128
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,660
really it's what's funny is if you look

1129
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:59,890
at the just simple again o cent right

1130
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:03,069
open-source intelligence you go to

1131
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:04,779
LinkedIn you can find the the two

1132
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:07,210
profiles for these guys you've got top

1133
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:09,400
retar here who's the owner of biz tech

1134
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:11,530
and M&T marketing and then michael fan

1135
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,750
who's the owner at jazz coffee trade

1136
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:16,359
limited but then if you go look at the

1137
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:18,130
Facebook page of Michael fan you can see

1138
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:20,890
he also lists himself as an owner and

1139
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:22,119
beside the air of MNT marketing so you

1140
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:25,210
know the little pieces start to come

1141
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:27,369
together and they hide out it identified

1142
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,840
through this blockchain analysis through

1143
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:31,270
following the money that the cops

1144
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,520
identified ot SR and MNT marketing as

1145
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:34,420
the companies that were laundering money

1146
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,450
for deep

1147
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:39,160
web so there you go so you're you're

1148
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:40,990
broadcasting to the world that you're

1149
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:44,259
the owner of these companies and you

1150
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:45,970
were also using for criminal proceeds so

1151
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:48,160
starting with these shell companies

1152
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:52,118
basically that's how they were able to

1153
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:55,598
get them to the Deep Web admins another

1154
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:58,240
good example of how these OPSEC mistakes

1155
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:01,000
happen is the story of a senior dream

1156
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,339
market administrator who was arrested in

1157
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,170
the u.s. on his way to a beard growing

1158
00:43:03,339 --> 00:43:08,230
competition

1159
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:10,539
oxi monster was a very prominent member

1160
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:14,140
of the dream community he was also a

1161
00:43:10,539 --> 00:43:15,670
form admin and a vendor and his identity

1162
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:19,000
was actually pieced together quite

1163
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:22,180
interestingly by analyzing public posts

1164
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,890
on Instagram and Twitter from a an

1165
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:26,259
individual by the name of gal Valerius

1166
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:27,819
and they compared these posts make so

1167
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:30,549
he's probably already on their radar and

1168
00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:33,190
they compared these posts to to the

1169
00:43:30,549 --> 00:43:35,529
dream film's post of a individual by the

1170
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:37,450
name of oxy monster and basically just

1171
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:39,099
looking at the the grammar and the

1172
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:41,618
syntax of all these messages they were

1173
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:45,670
able to start putting together some some

1174
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:48,490
clues what really started to go wrong is

1175
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:53,410
when the feds were able to associate

1176
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:56,049
this Bitcoin wallet address which was a

1177
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:57,910
tip jar on dream to a person named gal

1178
00:43:56,049 --> 00:44:00,009
Valerius so a tip jar is basically just

1179
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:02,319
what it sounds like if you feel that the

1180
00:44:00,009 --> 00:44:04,660
the vendor provided excellent service

1181
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:06,609
you know the your drugs came on time and

1182
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:09,098
maybe gave you a little extra you could

1183
00:44:06,609 --> 00:44:12,910
tip him in bitcoins for the service that

1184
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:15,789
they rendered and so this was associated

1185
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:18,399
with gal Valerius and then on 31 August

1186
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:20,259
he was actually detained on his in

1187
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,869
Atlanta on his way to the competition in

1188
00:44:20,259 --> 00:44:26,380
Texas and the indictment states that

1189
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:28,450
during the search they found on his

1190
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:31,089
laptop they found login creds for the

1191
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:33,939
dream website and an encryption key tied

1192
00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:36,009
to oxy monster were both found on his

1193
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,390
laptops you know it's like these guys

1194
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:38,859
have never heard of tales or like burner

1195
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:41,618
laptops right they just keep this stuff

1196
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:44,799
sitting right there on their laptops now

1197
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:47,690
gävle is he was subsequently tried and

1198
00:44:44,799 --> 00:44:50,140
found guilty of distributing drugs and

1199
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:52,550
sentenced to 20 years in federal prison

1200
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:55,640
but you gotta admit it's a pretty sick

1201
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:56,060
beard he might have one you never know

1202
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,450
right

1203
00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:01,009
so as of April last year Wall Street

1204
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:03,230
Market was basically one of the biggest

1205
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:05,210
markets out there it had 5,400 vendors

1206
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:06,680
over a million customers and like all

1207
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:08,990
the other markets basically it was

1208
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:11,540
taking a cut of all the transactions

1209
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:14,149
that were going through it and Wall

1210
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:16,970
Street Market was also apparently the

1211
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:20,359
successor to German Plaza Market which

1212
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:23,359
exit scammed in 2016 and so by using

1213
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:25,098
again blockchain analysis so those of

1214
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,348
you that are still under the impression

1215
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:30,700
that blockchain is anonymous well it's

1216
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:33,380
not we can find you they were able to

1217
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:35,419
associate funds that were used in the

1218
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:39,619
German plasma market with wallets are

1219
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:41,540
being associated with Wall Street so

1220
00:45:39,619 --> 00:45:43,010
this this bust is still relatively new

1221
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:44,900
but again the indictments kind of give

1222
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:49,069
us some clues as to what went down in

1223
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:50,540
this particular activity they basically

1224
00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:52,310
the police discovered that several

1225
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:54,319
servers that were thought to belong

1226
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:56,000
belonging to Wall Street they found

1227
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,680
these servers on the clarinet and then

1228
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,970
they start imaging them and searching

1229
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,700
through them for clues just like the

1230
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:04,009
Dutch had done with the HTC U and there

1231
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,348
weren't any immediate smoking guns in

1232
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:08,030
the data but they actually found some

1233
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:10,160
pseudonyms that would they were later

1234
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:13,490
able to tie back to the defendants in

1235
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,109
this case who are behind this like if

1236
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:16,430
you're gonna use a pseudonym on the dark

1237
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:18,348
web you're gonna do illegal activity

1238
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:20,000
don't reuse this stuff on the clear web

1239
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:23,690
like don't use it for your Facebook or

1240
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,980
your Twitter account now the authorities

1241
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,690
were also able to analyze some network

1242
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,849
traffic and get some additional clues

1243
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:31,430
and in one case those three defendants

1244
00:46:28,849 --> 00:46:34,010
what his VPN connection actually

1245
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:36,740
betrayed him when it would drop it

1246
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:39,050
periodically an unmasked his real-world

1247
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:41,419
IP so he wasn't using a very good VPN

1248
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:43,550
because most of the ones that have that

1249
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:46,220
security kill switch you know they won't

1250
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:47,960
do that to you but basically he dropped

1251
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,759
and he was actively using the Wall

1252
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,170
Street Market infrastructure and it

1253
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,329
turns out that the address was

1254
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:55,579
associated with a mobile UMTS device

1255
00:46:53,329 --> 00:46:57,410
which was registered in a fictitious

1256
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:59,089
name but basically they just surveilled

1257
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:00,890
the stick they every time to stick a lit

1258
00:46:59,089 --> 00:47:01,880
up they figured out it lit up in two

1259
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:03,529
places that lit up

1260
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,090
this residential address in lit up in

1261
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:07,760
this corporate address well probably

1262
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:09,290
home and work right so just doing some

1263
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,700
good old gumshoe and detective work and

1264
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:12,980
surveillance they basically found this

1265
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:15,410
guy one of the other guys

1266
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:17,960
his VPN service was actually registered

1267
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:20,720
in the name of his mother so the cops

1268
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,220
just went to the house and questioned

1269
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,680
her and then basically he later just

1270
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:28,100
said yep it was me I I was running WSM

1271
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:30,730
and then looking at the images turned up

1272
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:34,009
some PGP keys and these PGP keys were

1273
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:35,630
associated with a wallet that was used

1274
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:37,700
to pay for some digital marketing

1275
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:40,550
services right so maybe they were

1276
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:42,169
actually paying for ads on Deep Web for

1277
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:45,230
example or some of these other places

1278
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:47,660
that that were were letting you

1279
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:48,980
advertise so basically looking at that

1280
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:50,830
they were able to piece together that

1281
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:53,450
this these PGP keys were actually

1282
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:55,759
associated with a person by the name of

1283
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:57,350
Klaus murder and frost at web de so

1284
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,390
cause Martin frost being the real Webb

1285
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:02,110
identity or the real world identity of

1286
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:04,279
the third Wall Street Market admin so

1287
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:06,260
upset mistakes all over the place but

1288
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,670
what's really interesting is that these

1289
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:10,220
guys were actually planning an exit scam

1290
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:12,620
when the cops started looking at the

1291
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:14,209
servers and a bunch of people actually

1292
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:17,450
started noticing if you look on dredit

1293
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:20,630
basically it says here like you know we

1294
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:23,270
can tell their exit scamming and we're

1295
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:25,580
now sure that the law enforcement have

1296
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:26,990
the IP addresses and user names for the

1297
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:30,350
admin panel how did they know that

1298
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:32,569
because some guy posted the his username

1299
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:36,950
and password to the admin panel of Wall

1300
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:39,710
Street Market on reddit and we weren't

1301
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:42,140
sure at this point who had done that and

1302
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:44,690
why until the indictment came out and

1303
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:46,609
this guy is a treasure trove of OPSEC

1304
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:49,070
failure you kind of almost feel sorry

1305
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:51,920
for him because he just really wanted to

1306
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:54,020
be part of this community and so this is

1307
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,380
a guy by the name of Marcos Paulo de

1308
00:48:54,020 --> 00:49:00,980
Oliveira on Bali and he was a WSM mod

1309
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:03,170
and a also a subreddit mod for WSM

1310
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:05,090
he spoke English and Portuguese and

1311
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:07,310
apparently he had interacted with the

1312
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:08,870
Dutch police on Hansa

1313
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:11,000
this is him actually having a

1314
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:13,130
conversation with the Hansa the Dutch

1315
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,690
police basically what they were looking

1316
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:15,340
for is they just wanted to find out his

1317
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:17,530
real world

1318
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:18,580
address and he was like no I can't

1319
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:20,650
really give that away because they were

1320
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:23,080
trying to get him a security like a an

1321
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:24,670
RSA security token or something to log

1322
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:27,220
on to the website I'm gonna mail him

1323
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,890
something and he's like no no but it's

1324
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:31,209
funny who basically says you know I I

1325
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:33,540
don't don't give my address to the

1326
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:35,830
police because I trust you guys right so

1327
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:37,690
if you start digging into this

1328
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:39,400
particular individual you can see that

1329
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:41,470
he had a Twitter account by the name of

1330
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:44,290
dark net citizen he had a github account

1331
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:46,089
under the name of coins of pixel and he

1332
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:49,779
had a custom PGP key that was registered

1333
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:51,670
to Marcos at Marcos and evilly com if

1334
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:53,890
you go look at his github account you

1335
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:55,600
can see it's also associated with coins

1336
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:58,290
of pixel over here oops

1337
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:00,700
did I go too far no all right yeah this

1338
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:02,950
personalized Bitcoin address of one

1339
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,839
Marcos blah blah blah blah right that

1340
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:07,750
was also registered as I said to Marco's

1341
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:09,460
an eval EECOM he had a reddit account

1342
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:11,950
that used the same name as his Twitter

1343
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:15,190
handle and he also had a key base proof

1344
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:18,520
for Marco's anabolic you could go to

1345
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:21,010
MSDN and find Marco sandy valley coins

1346
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,690
epistle but coins of pixel calm as well

1347
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:25,480
so this guy just basically spread his

1348
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:26,590
information far and wide and confused

1349
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,150
everything and just to make matters

1350
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:30,220
worse he had a Flickr account and a

1351
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:35,230
discusses account that was also in that

1352
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:37,509
name so if you look at one of his prior

1353
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:39,550
employment if you go to the you know the

1354
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:41,530
Wayback Machine you can find a page that

1355
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:43,180
lists a Marco sandy Valley who was a

1356
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:44,380
customer feedback supervisor and that's

1357
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:46,950
really what he did for a lot of these

1358
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:50,350
markets was he facilitated transaction

1359
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:52,569
disagreements if you will and it was

1360
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:55,150
what was really cool about this is the

1361
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:57,190
federal agent actually noticed a book on

1362
00:50:55,150 --> 00:51:00,820
the over his left shoulder there's a

1363
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:04,180
book called Gomorrah and there was I

1364
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:06,040
believe that the author's name but the

1365
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:09,129
author's name had been discussed in some

1366
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,240
forum posts by Marco sandy Valley and

1367
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,890
some other people he said I

1368
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,089
yeah I've read that book I have it it's

1369
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:14,259
really great have you read this other

1370
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:16,510
book and have you seen this and seeing

1371
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:18,100
that and so the federal agent that was

1372
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:19,420
looking at this picture actually notice

1373
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,130
that and basically that was sort of the

1374
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:23,530
smoking gun that yeah this is our guide

1375
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:25,510
this is what he looks like and just for

1376
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:28,000
good measure of course he was you know

1377
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:29,170
basically had his password leaked in a

1378
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,680
in a

1379
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:34,089
password breach for team fortress so the

1380
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,339
moral of the story is whether you're

1381
00:51:34,089 --> 00:51:38,200
doing good or bad on the dark web it's

1382
00:51:36,339 --> 00:51:41,078
probably not a good idea to you know

1383
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:43,328
start mixing up these identities and if

1384
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:45,010
you do in the course of your research do

1385
00:51:43,329 --> 00:51:47,799
find some interesting things like IP

1386
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:49,900
addresses and like real world identities

1387
00:51:47,799 --> 00:51:51,490
like contact law enforcement and help us

1388
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:59,829
clean up this part of the web so thank

1389
00:51:51,490 --> 00:52:07,500
you I don't know if there any questions

1390
00:51:59,829 --> 00:52:07,500
I'm happy to take some cool

1391
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,140
you
