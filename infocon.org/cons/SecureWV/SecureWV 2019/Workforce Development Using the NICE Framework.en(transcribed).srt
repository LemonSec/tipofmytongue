1
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:21,220
okay thank you everybody for coming and

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,848
attending this talk I call it Workforce

3
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:27,189
Development using the nice framework

4
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:29,619
this talk has multiple audiences I want

5
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:32,488
to give people some some hope with

6
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:36,040
regards to both finds work and both

7
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:37,510
finding people for work but mostly for

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,850
people that are in love with security

9
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,860
and can't find a way to work in the role

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,350
that would really make them happy

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,050
it's a paraphrase the abstract I truly

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:51,570
believe that this work can bring you joy

13
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:56,140
and I want to see everybody doing it so

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,120
so this is part of what I like to do in

15
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,800
my free time right I'll help people with

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,828
resumes really that's how this all got

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,620
started like going way back when getting

18
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,240
on say slack or talking to people saying

19
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,920
hey send me your resume and I'll take a

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,780
look at it and we'll walk through it

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,659
together and he would come up with some

22
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:17,620
improvements and then that sort of

23
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:18,970
evolved into I've run some online resume

24
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,470
review workshops right that was one of

25
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,039
the first thing I did is invited some

26
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,270
people we all got together on zoom'

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,590
people were willing to put the resume up

28
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,490
in front of other people and we just

29
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,159
sort of talked through it together

30
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:32,439
saying hey should you try this you

31
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,670
should try that and then I invited some

32
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:35,648
recruiters along and some hiring

33
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,920
managers to give some input and feedback

34
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:41,079
and say here are some of the things I

35
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,530
look for in a resume write not so much

36
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:45,908
don't do this or don't do that but have

37
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,770
them relay their experience if things

38
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:49,780
are really resonated with them and as

39
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:52,630
hiring managers that's some really solid

40
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,039
advice and then that grew into doing

41
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:57,189
mock interview and resume review

42
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:59,740
workshops there's a open source project

43
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:02,380
called them mock interview and resume

44
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,359
review workshop anybody can pull that

45
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,189
down taking materials and it's a really

46
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:09,070
good jumpstart on running that workshop

47
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:10,709
so I did that at b-sides Nashville and I

48
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,540
also volunteered to do that at Derby con

49
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,820
hax for pancakes and this is bat will be

50
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,700
I think like the primary authors of that

51
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,170
project it's supported right they are

52
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,570
always every time they run one they'll

53
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,160
feed back into a little bit whatever

54
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:27,459
they learn it's definitely a wonderful

55
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,629
project so I got to fall doing that and

56
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:32,180
then and then I started

57
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:34,760
really getting interested in how to

58
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,189
solve the bones the things that are

59
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,349
causing people pain but there's a lot of

60
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:43,010
like stress and anxiety around this

61
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:45,499
whole realm of of what we're doing or

62
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,599
what would you like our work getting a

63
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:49,700
job or even filling a position is really

64
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,339
stressful and so I started talking with

65
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,010
recruiters and I'm like okay what are

66
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,599
the things you see and what do you think

67
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,310
is causing that what causes these

68
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:01,159
problems and that's what I started doing

69
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,480
right when I would go to a conference I

70
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:05,599
would look around to the vendors and

71
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,459
take their stuff and I would ask them

72
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,260
questions and I'd be like yeah I'm sure

73
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,549
your product is wonderful but I'm not

74
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,810
really interested in buying that what I

75
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:15,590
want to hear is about your hiring

76
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,969
practices right so I'm like hey you work

77
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,650
there what was it like it hired

78
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:20,629
do you ever hire anybody how big is your

79
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,730
team what are you doing like I had one

80
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:25,069
experience with a company that builds a

81
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,599
cyber range so instead of going up to

82
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:28,638
them and saying like hey I want to buy

83
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,230
your cyber range or how do you get

84
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,030
engaged or get access to your cyber

85
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,280
range I'm like does anybody ever use

86
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,470
your cyber range to test prospective

87
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,150
employees and measure how good they are

88
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,739
at something and I actually added like

89
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,689
repeat myself three or four times before

90
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:43,129
they got what I was getting at and then

91
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:44,540
they're like no no no one would ever do

92
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:46,159
that because it's too expensive right so

93
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,569
but that's kind of what I've been doing

94
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,478
right I would talk the guy from secure

95
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:52,129
ideas Kevin Johnson he actually is

96
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:55,040
really active and involved with

97
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:56,780
mentoring his company gives training and

98
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,150
all different kinds of levels summer

99
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,340
which are like like extremely affordable

100
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,599
right and I talked to him about some of

101
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,889
these projects I'd walk up to their

102
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,619
tables at booths and that's how I got

103
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:08,650
started I just kept asking questions so

104
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,759
right now I'm in the middle of a survey

105
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,379
anybody could go take it if you find me

106
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:14,448
on Twitter it's pinned in the top of my

107
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:16,519
account you can go take a Twitter survey

108
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:19,280
it's a multi-part thing the first part

109
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,599
is what was it like getting hired and

110
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,940
what is it like where you work the

111
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:24,110
second part is for hiring managers all

112
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,580
right tell me a little bit about the

113
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,870
process you go through the hire people

114
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:31,520
right so these are these are a sample of

115
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,840
questions I'm asking people who are

116
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,299
going through the looking and hiring

117
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,919
process one of the things I was being

118
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,400
told is that training isn't done

119
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:42,440
consistently and when it happens it's

120
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,280
it's really done without a plan right so

121
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,320
I said I would go

122
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,820
I would talk to a recruiter I talked to

123
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,740
someone at a table and that was a common

124
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,690
thread so I built some of my questions I

125
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,580
try to pull out the root causes of that

126
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,139
I was told I was being told about people

127
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,060
getting into the interview process and

128
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:57,980
finding the job to be completely

129
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,690
different than what they expected right

130
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,240
or even get into the interview process

131
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,969
have everything go really well and that

132
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,260
was the last I heard of it forever right

133
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,880
no matter how hard they try to get back

134
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,950
in touch with those people so I started

135
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,260
building questions to try to get at the

136
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,820
root causes of those things that survey

137
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,289
is ongoing and I do have some lessons

138
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,090
learned already that I'll get to in the

139
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,500
next slides here but these are some of

140
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,159
the questions that I ask people who are

141
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,780
doing hiring and you're welcome to take

142
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,700
that survey share it with your friends

143
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,320
if you don't like it share with your

144
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,849
enemies but I want to get more and more

145
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,500
information and try to get at some of

146
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,810
these root causes right and that's

147
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,460
that's really who I am or what I'm

148
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,820
interested in right there there are

149
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:40,940
certain things that make people feel

150
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:43,190
really helpless right so getting hired

151
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,169
is so important right it's something we

152
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,419
stressed about a lot and it really hurts

153
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:49,849
me to see people go through that

154
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:51,859
suffering right I started doing resume

155
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,419
reviews and I'd get to know people and

156
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,390
have those conversations with them and

157
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:58,580
then hear that the they you know send it

158
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:02,120
out 40 times and then get any call backs

159
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:04,580
and I what I do resume reviews if it's

160
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,940
not a an area of work that I'm familiar

161
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,229
with

162
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,910
I'll go pair them with somebody who's

163
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:09,590
been through that process and hired and

164
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,090
try to get them something to look over

165
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,710
their resume and get it improved and

166
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:16,210
they still still nothing so that really

167
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:18,380
hurts and I think there are a lot of

168
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,479
systemic root causes that we're not

169
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,610
really sure of yet one that I'd like to

170
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,050
point out you know I like this one too

171
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,560
because it's from the other side of the

172
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:29,870
table think about this so even the

173
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,450
person that's doing the hiring it's

174
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,800
usually just one person and even if

175
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:37,099
they're not signing the check they have

176
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,710
to go to their boss and say this is the

177
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,570
one I really like this person now think

178
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,840
about how stressful that is from that

179
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:49,729
side of the table right how much would

180
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:51,590
it hurt your career if HR takes the what

181
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:54,650
you said was a great job description and

182
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,630
they add things to it like seven years

183
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,349
experience they pick seven it could be

184
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,080
12

185
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:04,998
seven years experience needs to have

186
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:07,008
this piece of technology and in for

187
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:08,059
whatever a college degree right those

188
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,169
are all things you must have they

189
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:10,969
weren't on your original job

190
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:12,710
descriptions they get at it now the

191
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:15,199
person comes in they're a great fit and

192
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,330
they don't have any of those things if I

193
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,569
like them I have to go to my boss and

194
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:23,300
say even though they don't meet the

195
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:25,759
requirements I want to hire them please

196
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,369
pay them money to come here and work if

197
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,430
that doesn't work out my credibility is

198
00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:33,589
done right I can I can maybe fight that

199
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,129
system a little bit but if I do and I

200
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:36,469
lose

201
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:37,999
I'm done right and so it's a really

202
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:40,069
stressful thing from both sides of the

203
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:43,819
table it shouldn't be that way that is

204
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:45,110
definitely one serious problem and then

205
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:48,830
one other thing I like to point out the

206
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:51,169
reason I like doing this talk is I call

207
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,849
it the Christmas rule all right you can

208
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:54,680
call it a holiday rule or any other

209
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:57,709
interaction where it's really important

210
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,899
that you do once a year that everyone's

211
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:03,499
stress is about that it affects everyone

212
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:04,879
around you but you never practice it and

213
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:06,499
it would be really hard to practice that

214
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,240
but the rule applies there are a couple

215
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:10,249
things in our professional lives that

216
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,740
really fall into that category one of

217
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:15,199
them is doing a resume and getting hired

218
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,729
another one could be the yearly review

219
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,830
all right those are both things that

220
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:21,610
fall into that category of they affect

221
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,839
our lives so much and we never practice

222
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,539
so I like to bring this up I've been

223
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,369
exploring the use of this tool because I

224
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,199
really think it would help some of the

225
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:32,360
lessons learned from my survey so far is

226
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,889
uh people don't get in it you know

227
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,829
people submit their resumes over and

228
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:38,120
over again they don't get interviews

229
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:39,679
what happens sometimes there is the

230
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,909
person thinks they want a position

231
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,739
they'll put up the Job Description

232
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,818
people will feed in their resumes

233
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,769
they'll see what they get back and

234
00:08:43,818 --> 00:08:47,449
they'll be like oh that's not really

235
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:49,040
what I wanted no one ever gets a call

236
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:50,899
back but people forget that the people

237
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,730
submitting resumes that that's a little

238
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:55,279
bit of hope in every single submission

239
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,600
and then it's gone right and I think

240
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,880
that's horrible

241
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,079
so one thing that that highlights is

242
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,269
hiring managers and the teams that build

243
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:08,089
job descriptions are kind of making it

244
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:10,550
up as they go right another lesson

245
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,170
learned is the whole process is kind of

246
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,349
a like a

247
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:16,060
bakbox right we like to think that if I

248
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,500
submit my resume and it really thinks

249
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,420
the person that reviewed it might give

250
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,880
me some feedback that happens really

251
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,229
inconsistency inconsistently that's

252
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,290
something I'm seeing my research to

253
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:28,360
write a lot of that has to do with trust

254
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,670
if I go in an interview and I bomb it

255
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,339
it's a risk for someone this give me

256
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,750
some feedback and tell me why I didn't

257
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,959
get a job offer

258
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:40,329
right there the liability questions I

259
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:41,949
can stir up some things and people just

260
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,719
to avoid it they don't give any feedback

261
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:49,660
but that makes the whole process closed

262
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:55,029
and it doesn't help anyone oh this isn't

263
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:58,060
going to having the right list of

264
00:09:55,029 --> 00:10:00,130
technologies on a job description and

265
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,189
look for people with certain kinds of

266
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,540
technology to me is an indicator of I'll

267
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,360
put it there the second bullet what got

268
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:10,269
you here won't get you there meaning

269
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:13,000
it's a throwback right when if I wanted

270
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:15,190
to hire for IT making sure someone had

271
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,699
experience with us my tech stack was

272
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:21,370
really important right because the

273
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:24,269
lifecycle of that stack of tech it was

274
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:26,410
more than two or three years maybe my

275
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:28,269
appreciation is five even and I try to

276
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,560
use that longer so what I'm hiring

277
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,910
someone I'm gonna make sure they're

278
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,099
coming in with a reasonable set of

279
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,329
skills to do that

280
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,070
someone's applying that same approach to

281
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:37,719
getting information security

282
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,540
professionals I want you to have worked

283
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,890
with this tech stack and I like my final

284
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,750
bullet there is one of my favorites in

285
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,220
the whole slide deck and like a lot of

286
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,620
times like what does this say about the

287
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,320
company if I'm going to make sure you

288
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,870
have a certain experience of a certain

289
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,279
kind of tech pros for one does that mean

290
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,720
that the company I'm looking to go to

291
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,279
right I'm reading a job description I

292
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,459
may want to apply for this if I read

293
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:04,000
that you must have experience with Palo

294
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:06,399
Alto firewalls what I mean is there a

295
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,990
part of that message that says like are

296
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,730
they keeping up on tech are they

297
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,839
planning on advancing do they know

298
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,209
what's coming next

299
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,160
are they not going to train me what

300
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:16,750
happens when I get there technology

301
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,819
evolves they get rid of Palo Alto

302
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,769
because technology or contracting of

303
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:22,000
some kind right and then what then what

304
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:23,529
am I going to do right are they going to

305
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,150
train me on the next thing maybe and

306
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:27,040
it's just interesting there

307
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,380
like there's a what I get to talk here

308
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,180
about getting at the root causes right

309
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,280
so a lot of people to take a step back

310
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,020
and think about like why would you hire

311
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,670
an information security professional and

312
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:40,750
a lot of the things in this whole realm

313
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:44,410
boiled down to understanding what you

314
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:48,190
need in your business and then knowing

315
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:49,990
how to ask for it and then get it right

316
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,460
it's not that simple it's simple this

317
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,590
would not be a problem at all people

318
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,330
would have no problems getting match the

319
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:57,100
work they want they would have no

320
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,320
problems training and then finding work

321
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,820
in that area so there are problems and I

322
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,710
think some of it has to do with people

323
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,320
losing focus on what they're actually

324
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:16,720
trying to do and matching the need of

325
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:18,280
the company to that so so so ok so in

326
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,110
some of my research in interviewing

327
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,630
people and some of my surveys the

328
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:25,900
problem seems to boil down to defining

329
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:28,000
specifically what a role is meaning day

330
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,520
to day I need a person to do these

331
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,550
things what are these things and clearly

332
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:36,430
defining that having the decisions made

333
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,650
to say here's what we're gonna pay the

334
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,000
process of interviewing and if they're I

335
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,760
have something I called measuring

336
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,280
competency which is an area I want to

337
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,710
research a little more as we look at the

338
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:50,770
tool it's got this section specifically

339
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:53,710
designed to build on called extensions

340
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:56,650
right this idea that you can define

341
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:59,560
information security roles but you still

342
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:02,470
need to have this concept of your

343
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,359
excelling you need help or your failing

344
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:09,970
like that's still a thing like we can't

345
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:11,500
get rid of Oh so the nice framework and

346
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,540
what I'm going to present here and talk

347
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,940
about so it's not going to solve all the

348
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,160
problems in information security hiring

349
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,720
right so for example one of my questions

350
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,060
I asked my survey it talks about

351
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,270
cultural fit and it doesn't matter how I

352
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,910
phrase it or different people I talk to

353
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:29,920
it's considered in the hiring process

354
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,939
your ability to work with the people

355
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,500
there in an effective way to produce

356
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,500
good results will always be part of the

357
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,010
hiring process and the the nice

358
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,380
cybersecurity work

359
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,959
course framework and the NIST 801 81

360
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:48,040
aren't necessarily going to help with

361
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:50,680
that there are also issues with let's

362
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,500
say diversity in the workplace diversity

363
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,870
in information security diversity in

364
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,240
corporate America overall and the

365
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,459
framework I don't know if it was on

366
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,990
purpose or not it seems to avoid that

367
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:05,229
altogether so there are certain things

368
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:06,579
that are real problems in information

369
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,560
security hiring that you're not gonna

370
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:11,500
get from this framework all right some

371
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,779
things about real issues and concerns

372
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,000
that are not going to be framework into

373
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:18,730
control are still going to exist and

374
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,459
still need to be tackled by people with

375
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,079
good practices good hearts so in some

376
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:24,729
cases and they're gonna have to address

377
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:26,138
some of those things that way having an

378
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,540
objective framework that helps you those

379
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:32,110
other things maybe can give you time to

380
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:36,579
work on those other those are like for

381
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:38,170
example here's in a situation where the

382
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:39,638
recruiters I talked to one of the main

383
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,349
thing that really irks them is when they

384
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:43,329
go to a business and say what do you

385
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,399
need they get a job description they

386
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:47,260
usually end up throwing it away sitting

387
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:48,910
down with a hiring manager working

388
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,439
through it again and really come up

389
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,750
coming up with what a person needs so

390
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,490
this is a pretty serious problem but in

391
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,889
the end the recruiter what they'll do is

392
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,449
they'll end up breaking down okay so day

393
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:00,010
to day we need this person to do what do

394
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:02,349
you need him to accomplish all right to

395
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,180
do that what do they need to know right

396
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,029
now you're gonna want them to have a

397
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,709
certain set of set of skills to maybe

398
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:10,089
make that a reality where they come in

399
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:11,138
you'll train them for some skills and

400
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:12,699
you want them to come in with others

401
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:14,680
what are they and they'll break this

402
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:17,079
down into task skills knowledge and

403
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:20,560
abilities which are nice framework

404
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:22,989
vocabulary so let's talk about the tool

405
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,089
right so I'm gonna break it down talk

406
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:28,660
about what it is and the different parts

407
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:30,819
to it so nice right it's a it's an

408
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,410
acronym which tells us right away if we

409
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:33,699
couldn't guess it has roots in the US

410
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,010
government

411
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:38,349
I've had people express the idea that

412
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:40,300
the nice framework really doesn't create

413
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,029
anything it just labels stuff that's

414
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,560
already there and lexicon is an

415
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:47,110
important part and if you read the NIST

416
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,380
801 81 they identify lexicon is a

417
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:52,960
serious underpinning cause to our hiring

418
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:55,689
problems but they do in their definite

419
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,010
come right out and say we want to create

420
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,510
something we want to energize and

421
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,980
promote a robust network and an

422
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:02,680
ecosystem of cybersecurity education

423
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,760
right so they do the goal and they want

424
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,020
to create something as much as any

425
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:10,300
framer creates anything the nist a twain

426
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,010
hundred one eighty one sort of just

427
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,459
defined the framework the framework

428
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:18,430
itself is delivered as a spreadsheet

429
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,480
right and the spreadsheet as we know we

430
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,760
use spreadsheets all the time they're

431
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,390
awesome they're it's a wonderful tool

432
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,950
spreadsheets have meaning

433
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,720
right there the rows and the columns the

434
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:30,100
relationships we try to meaning and

435
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:34,450
you'll notice over here on the side this

436
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:35,500
is going to zoom all right so you'll

437
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,610
notice over here on the side there are

438
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,140
links to other part of the spreadsheet

439
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,670
let's see if I can break out here and

440
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,780
just show it real quick I'm going to

441
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:43,270
show this two times

442
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,970
presenting a spreadsheet in a short talk

443
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:47,380
is not really super effective but I'm

444
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,360
going to do this real quick and then if

445
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,340
you can go check it out too you have

446
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,510
questions anybody can ask me any time so

447
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,480
they break it down into these high-level

448
00:16:52,510 --> 00:17:00,160
roles securely provision is our way to

449
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:03,280
say provision stuff securely operate it

450
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,010
maintains see your oversee and govern

451
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:09,160
and they break it down into specialty

452
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,660
area work role and then each of those

453
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,080
work roles they define into what you do

454
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:17,080
day to day so a privacy officer this guy

455
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,490
right here if I click on the tasks it'll

456
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:20,290
give me a list of what they might expect

457
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,589
the privacy officer to do on any given

458
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:25,990
day any me money mo work with the

459
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:27,879
general counsel yeah make sense so if

460
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,740
you're a privacy officer I would expect

461
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,590
you to be able to perform that task and

462
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:39,160
in terms of hiring I may write that

463
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:40,689
right in the job description so that was

464
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,770
just a quick view into what that is it's

465
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:46,060
a spreadsheet so in the spreadsheet you

466
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,700
saw on the left hand column there is

467
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,830
these ksas right knowledge skills and

468
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,870
abilities I mentioned the tasks so

469
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,129
knowledge is what it suggests and I

470
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,840
really like that they break this out

471
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:59,020
separately it's just things you know

472
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:04,720
related to the work right so for example

473
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:06,730
if you have the CISSP you have a certain

474
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,580
set of knowledge does that mean you can

475
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:12,910
two tasks no that mean you have the

476
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,439
skills to do the tasks no does that mean

477
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,330
you have demonstrated the ability

478
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,850
because if I get the definition ability

479
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,350
that's I've delivered something related

480
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,668
to what you want that's what ability is

481
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,840
in this definition does that mean you

482
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:24,429
can have the ability No

483
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,309
right it puts it right where you need it

484
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:28,630
it's a validation of a set of knowledge

485
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:30,220
right if you look at the the framework

486
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,570
it'll put these things out and it'll

487
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,610
separate here's what you need to know

488
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,610
here's the skills you need to have and

489
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:48,100
okay so skills is kind of like the one

490
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,129
where what is a skill versus an ability

491
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,480
when is a knowledge become a skill what

492
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,720
is it so this is the way they define it

493
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,700
right it's taking the tools and having

494
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,950
an impact on the security posture of the

495
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,330
organization or an individual and I say

496
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:04,360
tools because it's first but it also

497
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:06,370
means taking a process and having an

498
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,139
impacting ability to do that means you

499
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,000
have the skill that's how they define it

500
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,610
and if I come back to this I mean task

501
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,400
is the piece of work combined with other

502
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:19,330
tasks to compose a work experience or

503
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,190
role abilities abilities is it delivered

504
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,740
you have examples of deliverables and

505
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,340
this is how you use the nice framework

506
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,740
right super easy

507
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,730
combine these things look at the

508
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,830
framework and what you're trying to

509
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:32,260
produce you want to look at a human

510
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:34,120
capital planning and boom right so when

511
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,320
I put my notes here take the separate

512
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,270
parts turn them through the framework

513
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,850
produce your output that you're

514
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:43,750
targeting and profit right so I mean

515
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:45,428
it's not that easy this is the diagram

516
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:48,250
in there but they leave it open for you

517
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:49,870
to apply this however you'd like so I

518
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:54,480
want to give a mention to the extensions

519
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:58,709
here they they understand that in a job

520
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,710
role there are certain levels of

521
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,230
effectiveness for performance right and

522
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,580
they want to acknowledge that that you

523
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,710
can still work in the framework and

524
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:11,409
still measure performance it's a really

525
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:14,320
great paper and presentation from DHS

526
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,370
DHS took this and they layered over the

527
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,350
top of it

528
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,969
the idea of competency right and so they

529
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,408
use this what's built in the framework

530
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,620
for extensions and said okay we're going

531
00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:22,480
to

532
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:25,719
talk to experts and we're gonna come up

533
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,910
with a way to have people work in these

534
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,590
fields and know that they may not have

535
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,750
all the knowledge skills and abilities

536
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,309
right from the start right and then we

537
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,200
need to build up their competence and we

538
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:36,340
need to do that over time and that's

539
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,620
gonna be a great way where we can use

540
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,300
the framework but be practical about it

541
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:44,020
so you can go check that out that's a

542
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:45,010
really great add-on there so if I look

543
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,330
through that tool if I pull up the

544
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,620
spreadsheet and I start searching

545
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,990
there's certain key things that I don't

546
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,629
find right I don't find this requirement

547
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:56,380
for years of experience I don't find

548
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:58,780
this the terminology junior/senior right

549
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,400
tech 3 tech 4 like that's not in there

550
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,350
it doesn't mean anything here which

551
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,809
basically boils down to and why I like

552
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:07,330
this so much is if you can complete the

553
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:09,309
task and you can do it in a way that

554
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:11,169
demonstrates you have the knowledge you

555
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:14,559
can use the skills and you can produce

556
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:16,929
the result you can do the role it

557
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:20,530
doesn't matter now experience does

558
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:23,650
matter we know from our own work of

559
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:27,160
working in a lab failure teaches us a

560
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:29,050
lot and if I go to a class and I follow

561
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,390
the instructions and I get it right I

562
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,040
know something maybe even have a little

563
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,200
bit of skill but it is until I get it

564
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,620
wrong a thousand times do I really learn

565
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,260
something right so experience matters if

566
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:44,169
you have someone who's been faced with

567
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,429
obstacles over a long time they're going

568
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,250
to be able to deliver things more

569
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:53,140
consistently as problems arise right so

570
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:56,830
experience matters so yeah just to

571
00:21:53,140 --> 00:22:00,610
summarize it's a tool well I want to get

572
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:02,169
into this example here so here's how ok

573
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,360
suppose you were looking at a job

574
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:05,890
description and you want to hire someone

575
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,469
that I'm calling a web application

576
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:11,410
analyst right so taking a real job

577
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:13,420
description out there taking a real job

578
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,250
description I pulled out some things

579
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,290
that I thought could use a little bit of

580
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,800
work right we see things like this these

581
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:24,070
aren't bad responsibilities for this job

582
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:25,540
but it's also really like loose like you

583
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,280
can you can get many different

584
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,139
candidates as many different experiences

585
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,670
if you throw this out there but not

586
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,070
really ever get what you want right so

587
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:34,539
if I look at this first one

588
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:36,668
hands-on software development experience

589
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:37,959
you have developed applications and

590
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:41,199
understand application security

591
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:42,669
fundamentals not bad but if I go into

592
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:45,729
the nice framework and I start looking

593
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:47,949
at the software developer and what they

594
00:22:45,729 --> 00:22:50,529
would require from a software developer

595
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:52,749
in terms of daily tasks I can do a

596
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:55,570
little better I listed of them all and I

597
00:22:52,749 --> 00:22:58,239
bolded a few do you think maybe they

598
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:01,779
meant whoever created this this is job

599
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:03,879
posting that what I really want he is a

600
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:06,249
person who can work with analysts

601
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:09,158
engineers to do the design and obtain

602
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:11,709
the information and the requirements for

603
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:13,599
the interfaces of the product yeah like

604
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:15,129
that's that's a whole lot closer to

605
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,168
something real that might actually

606
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:19,418
happen in the workplace i bolded the

607
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:21,699
bottom one to perform secure programming

608
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:23,499
and identify potential flaws in code to

609
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:27,779
mitigate vulnerabilities so the first

610
00:23:23,499 --> 00:23:29,949
one wasn't bad but this one's nicer I

611
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:32,889
don't do I don't do jokes that was as

612
00:23:29,949 --> 00:23:35,349
close as I'm going to get anything so

613
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:38,609
this one here you see list some

614
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:42,968
languages having a deep knowledge oh

615
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:46,779
this the senior the junior role reads

616
00:23:42,969 --> 00:23:49,509
have knowledge and the senior role says

617
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:51,069
have deep knowledge so this is I mean

618
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:52,839
this is another example of a way where

619
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:54,819
if we take the framework look through

620
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:56,619
that that developer role and say okay

621
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:58,119
what do they really need to know what

622
00:23:56,619 --> 00:24:00,158
knowledge skills and abilities do they

623
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:01,569
need I listed some out here but is it

624
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,449
possible they really really are looking

625
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:06,539
for knowledge of application security

626
00:24:04,449 --> 00:24:08,469
threats and vulnerabilities and

627
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:10,629
injections race conditions and so on

628
00:24:08,469 --> 00:24:12,729
skill and writing code in a currently

629
00:24:10,629 --> 00:24:14,589
supported language I can even leave off

630
00:24:12,729 --> 00:24:16,929
the little parenthesis and it still has

631
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:19,239
a lot of meaning ability to develop

632
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:21,099
secure software according to deployment

633
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:22,959
methodologies tools and practices I'm

634
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:25,178
saying the same thing I'm using nice

635
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:28,209
terminology and I'm way more likely to

636
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:30,309
get a person that I might actually hire

637
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:31,839
give me their resume if I build a Job

638
00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:34,269
Description using these these last one

639
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,249
this one comes up a lot you have to be

640
00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:37,959
able to communicate well especially if

641
00:24:36,249 --> 00:24:40,299
you're a pen tester right because if you

642
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:41,979
give a report and that's your interface

643
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:43,389
to the customer and they have to like

644
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:45,819
your report and they have to act on it

645
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:48,370
so they hire us again next year and in

646
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:50,230
my web application analyst position here

647
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,939
have strongly written verbal

648
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,620
communication skills you will be

649
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,690
reporting on methodology findings of

650
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:58,479
recommendation but if I look through the

651
00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:00,220
nice terminology are the nice roles and

652
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,260
job descriptions and I say I can do a

653
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:05,050
little better i bolded one but these are

654
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:08,620
all translate requirements into

655
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:10,690
application elements tax services threat

656
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,699
modeling and defining any specific

657
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:15,700
security criteria nowhere in there does

658
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:18,220
it require that person to be able to

659
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,380
report that verbally or any specific way

660
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,760
but just let them know I'm gonna want

661
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,350
you to have be able to communicate and

662
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,080
if I get a person who's really good at

663
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,699
writing reports they still sort of like

664
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,020
pass my test and I might hire them I

665
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,000
don't really ever need them to talk to

666
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,620
anyone like it that's not something they

667
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,059
can do they have a lot of other skills

668
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,469
that are helpful to me in my business I

669
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:36,639
don't have to make that a limiting

670
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:39,790
factor that throws them out of the

671
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:43,660
candidate pool because I need this task

672
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:45,340
done but I don't have to prescribe how

673
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,960
it's done right and that's one of the

674
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:49,030
nice benefits of using this framework

675
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,760
right another thing that's nice about

676
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:54,899
the framework and job descriptions is it

677
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,490
can lead to more objective rejections

678
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:01,030
which goes back to my my research that

679
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:02,290
says it's a black box right if I can be

680
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:05,110
really more a little more objective

681
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:07,659
about what's going on when a person

682
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,590
comes to me and says like I I've done

683
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,870
this and this and this

684
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,030
right I first off now I have a little

685
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:14,590
bit of an avenue to sort of poke and

686
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,899
test for a specific skill under

687
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:20,159
knowledge but when I do rejections I can

688
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:25,120
also say things like I needed more

689
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:27,340
ability or well a000 for and I have

690
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,989
never seen you you be interviewed you

691
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,750
never talked about actually executing

692
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:33,460
anything that resembles tasks zero to

693
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:35,740
whatever but I can give the person

694
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,110
feedback I can be objective about it and

695
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:46,929
I can worry less about where that

696
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:48,639
interaction is gonna go so as we talked

697
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:51,190
about that it's the next part I like

698
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,360
that agility okay so last part of this

699
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,309
section so I'm doing to do three

700
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,070
sections I'm gonna do

701
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:58,870
hiring then I'm going to talk about hire

702
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,740
getting hired in Career Management at

703
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:02,020
the end I'll talk a little bit of

704
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,880
resumes

705
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,590
so we did a conversation about the

706
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,900
existing job description but what if we

707
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:10,360
wanted to start from scratch right I'm

708
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,320
going to build out a team and I'm going

709
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,879
to live I'm gonna build my job

710
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,770
descriptions using the nice

711
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,020
cybersecurity framework and here's how

712
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:19,270
you do it right you break down the job

713
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:21,370
description start with the tasks you

714
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:23,500
need the person to do generate the list

715
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:25,928
of knowledge skills and abilities and

716
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:28,870
build out the concept build out the

717
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:32,500
concept of competency later what if at

718
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:33,909
the bottom here to do this you have to

719
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,620
talk to people in the organization and

720
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:37,630
really get an understanding of what the

721
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,040
needs are and when it's time to actually

722
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,870
pay this person and bring them on board

723
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,730
right you'll be that much further along

724
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:44,139
than within the buy-in and I did it

725
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,090
right so I created something called an

726
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,230
IP security engineer I didn't come up

727
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:49,120
with a name I just use the nice

728
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:52,540
framework at the top here just for

729
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,399
demonstration I put the path sort of so

730
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,559
to speak that it's the securely

731
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,660
provision category the secant system

732
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,178
architecture role and then it's the

733
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,429
security architect sub role and I've

734
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:05,140
refined the list of tasks I cut it down

735
00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:07,000
because I didn't want to be a giant

736
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,400
slide but you could take something like

737
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,980
this you can go to the team and say okay

738
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,270
we got to trim this back a little that's

739
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,650
something that's practical and a

740
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,840
reasonable list but what does a person

741
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:18,550
need to know to be a security architect

742
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,629
this the framework thinks they need

743
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,580
knowledge of authentication

744
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:23,860
authorization and access control methods

745
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:26,020
everyone agree yes they need knowledge

746
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:29,889
of application vulnerabilities and some

747
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:31,720
people will go so I cut that one right I

748
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:34,600
mean we can have a conversation we can

749
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:39,190
work from this and then here's the rest

750
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:41,230
of that skills and abilities okay all

751
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:44,770
right so moving on to the next section

752
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:47,920
here this is about working in an

753
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:50,010
environment right so let's flip you have

754
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,720
flip sides the other side of the table

755
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,980
and some of the conversations don't just

756
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,590
have to happen during the hiring process

757
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,360
they can be considered when internally

758
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:59,678
when you're considering a promotion or

759
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,229
considering changing roles inside a

760
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,929
business so somewhere between hiring and

761
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,610
getting hired is a lot of work alright

762
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:10,450
these are just like little blips on our

763
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:13,449
career radars in terms of time retaining

764
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:15,450
people is very challenging a lot of

765
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:16,920
places where you

766
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,870
a lot of places where you might work you

767
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,490
have an animal review and it's rare to

768
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:23,790
find someone that can objectively show

769
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:27,660
you that you're doing a good job that's

770
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:29,970
a huge problem right I mean I'm if good

771
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,700
for you if you work in a place where you

772
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:34,170
have goals yeah someone that you work

773
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:37,110
with checks in with you on a regular

774
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:39,480
basis saying hey you have this goal and

775
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:41,370
you're falling behind here here you have

776
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,770
this goal and you're killing it either

777
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:46,709
way like some sort of feedback on how

778
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:49,730
you're doing is too rare right and

779
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:52,260
retaining people ends up being a game of

780
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:54,030
building a relationship and challenging

781
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,920
them to do work right pushing them to

782
00:29:54,030 --> 00:30:04,260
get better giving them the tools to get

783
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:06,180
better right so so I want to propose

784
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,850
that this is a tool that we can use as a

785
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:12,390
self-assessment so it'll be really great

786
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:14,010
if our managers and our bosses use this

787
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:17,670
and did this as their job right so it is

788
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:21,720
their job but you need to be a vector

789
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:23,400
right so I don't really know physics but

790
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,420
I am gonna I'm gonna borrow and stretch

791
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:31,290
one of the principles right my physics

792
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:35,640
teacher way back in with mr. Marley so a

793
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:37,470
vector is is force or work in a

794
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,640
direction so if you think about your

795
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:43,830
work and your career as a dot on a

796
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:47,940
coordinate plane and you have all of

797
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:51,300
this potential energy it's not really a

798
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:54,480
vector it's not really useful until you

799
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:56,340
pick a direction right I mean you have

800
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,130
all this learning you read blogs you do

801
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:02,340
CTF and if you're not working towards a

802
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:04,500
goal you have all of this stuff built up

803
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,270
in one spot but you're not going to go

804
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:11,160
anywhere it's not going to produce any

805
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:13,560
work and if I'm gonna beat this physics

806
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:16,230
analogy a little bit more right static

807
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:18,810
friction like static friction is is

808
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:20,490
horrible right we all experience that in

809
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:23,490
different ways but it's that thing that

810
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:26,640
makes it hard for us to move all right

811
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:29,370
so I'm gonna ask a question so name a

812
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,800
special role not typically defined very

813
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:34,199
well whose job it is to break the static

814
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,750
friction and get you moving we've heard

815
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,910
it a couple times throughout the day a

816
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:43,520
person in your life maybe not your boss

817
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:46,440
but it could be your boss so okay so

818
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,660
mentor right that's how I'm going to

819
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,970
define mentor in this context right a

820
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:54,030
mentor is a person that lives between

821
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:58,140
the static friction and the sliding

822
00:31:54,030 --> 00:32:00,210
friction right a mentor job is to start

823
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,830
you moving all right so if you again

824
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,600
picture yourself and your career as a

825
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:06,570
dot on a plane with all this potential

826
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,850
energy once you have a direction getting

827
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:10,439
moving really hard and that's the way I

828
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:12,209
like to characterize the really good

829
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,370
Mentors the really good mentors are the

830
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:16,260
ones that start you moving break the

831
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:17,760
static friction if you're sliding along

832
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,200
that's great they don't have to be

833
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,970
involved if you come to a stop again

834
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:26,970
maybe they'll help you move along again

835
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:29,490
right so the key here though is you have

836
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:31,260
to pick the direction but I think of

837
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:34,200
mentoring engagements and why they fail

838
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:36,960
but it's a can you imagine if you took a

839
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,490
tool like a nice framework and laid out

840
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,040
all the knowledge skills and abilities

841
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:43,950
and your gaps and the place you want to

842
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,540
get to right you pick a role or pick a

843
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:48,000
certain subset of knowledge skills and

844
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:51,050
abilities in a role and take that to a

845
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,110
mentor and say can you help me get here

846
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:56,639
now it really it can work by a person

847
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,928
might not be the right person to push

848
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,480
you in that direction but if you go back

849
00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:02,580
to my analogy you have mentors all

850
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,470
around you in a circle right in

851
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,210
whichever direction you want to go there

852
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:09,059
is someone who can help break that

853
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:10,980
static friction if it's related to your

854
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:12,450
job right and that could be your boss

855
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:16,500
and your boss would be the one who can

856
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:18,960
give you the push right but again you

857
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,760
have to pick a direction so I read I

858
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,000
really like this guy's book right he

859
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,379
wrote a book called extreme ownership

860
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,540
it's a it's a really great book and in

861
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:30,150
that book it's a it's directed towards

862
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:32,580
what he calls leaders and in this

863
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:35,460
context I want you to go first and I

864
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:37,139
want you to take the loop on this right

865
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:40,170
so if it's working with your boss or

866
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:42,300
planning career move or starting a

867
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:43,260
career at a school I truly believe that

868
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:47,940
leader

869
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:51,150
are about moments right so you can be a

870
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:52,470
manager or not but doesn't necessarily

871
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,429
make you a leader you can be not a

872
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:58,110
manager and you can be a leader right I

873
00:33:55,429 --> 00:34:01,350
think leaders are just people who act

874
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:04,918
differently during certain moments and

875
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:06,959
that's it right and you may not feel

876
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:08,820
like a leader but there is something you

877
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,879
can take control of in this context

878
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,889
which is you can be prepared right so if

879
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:15,929
you look at the quote right the main

880
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:17,340
difference there the thing that makes

881
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,750
the leader the person the thing that

882
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,889
makes the person successful and in his

883
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,389
contacts he's coming from a

884
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:25,320
special-forces background the thing that

885
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:28,020
defeats the enemy is being ready to act

886
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,760
I need you talk a read the book there's

887
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,770
this major theme and the special course

888
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,750
is about practice practice practice

889
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:36,119
check the gear check the gear check the

890
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:38,760
gear do it over do it over do it over

891
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,560
introduce chaos introduce chaos try it

892
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,770
again try it again try it again it's all

893
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,270
about being prepared so and since I'm on

894
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:47,190
this slide here and it's a little cliche

895
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:49,980
I'm gonna throw any one of my favorite

896
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,510
right so the best time to plant a tree

897
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,570
is 20 years ago

898
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:59,430
the second best time to plant a tree is

899
00:34:54,570 --> 00:35:01,590
now so you have to go and take a look at

900
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,720
where are you to know where you want to

901
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:04,920
go so back to this slide right so let's

902
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,529
take a look at how this can be done with

903
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,790
a nice framework so first off don't

904
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,850
start with the things you don't know

905
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:13,680
right that's an infinite list right

906
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:15,480
think about the circle again all these

907
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,000
directions you have infinite choices of

908
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,100
directions ago and wherever you are the

909
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,780
things you know there are infinite

910
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,180
things around you you don't you can't

911
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,410
start with that right imagine again if

912
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,660
you imagine you're a dot and surrounded

913
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:30,029
by those things it's okay to want those

914
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:32,339
things but if you self-assessment starts

915
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:33,600
there you're going to be sad but you're

916
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,869
not going to do anything if you're going

917
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:39,210
to be sad and I'm here to make things

918
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:40,590
nice right so that's that said don't do

919
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:45,570
that start with the things you're good

920
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:46,830
at did you do this things where you have

921
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:49,440
accomplishments maybe you've done

922
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:50,790
something right find those tasks in the

923
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,890
roles and match them up as best you can

924
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,660
to the framework right then take the

925
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:57,180
framework the framework might not match

926
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,578
your job title exactly you may have a

927
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:01,680
you may have four rolls that you do in

928
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:03,150
your work try to match up the ones that

929
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,509
are the most closely aligned to you

930
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:06,240
there

931
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:08,430
review the multiple roll right copy out

932
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,379
the knowledge skills and abilities now

933
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:12,149
you can make a choice right so now you

934
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,040
have some some information and you're

935
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:15,900
ready to move you can decide

936
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,550
y'all want to fill out this role because

937
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,780
it's very unlikely that you have all the

938
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,880
knowledge all the skills and all the

939
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,680
abilities that one's kind of nice too if

940
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,809
your decision is yeah I'm happy with

941
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,690
this I really like this it brings me joy

942
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:30,210
right you can go to your boss and say

943
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:32,430
hey I'm doing these roles and I want to

944
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,809
be better at this that should be the

945
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:35,549
person who move you forward in that

946
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:38,069
direction that's the person you can turn

947
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:39,329
to if not you can go searching here's

948
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:41,700
what I mean by searching this is the way

949
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:42,630
we can use the tool so take those lists

950
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,910
of ksas

951
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,440
and search other roles for the things

952
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:48,770
you already know you're strong at again

953
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,730
we're starting with what we have and

954
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:52,619
understand that we may have to move in a

955
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:54,089
direction that gets us new things but

956
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:55,880
our self of mess sessemann starts with

957
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:58,770
what we have searched the other roles

958
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,809
that you're strong with review the tasks

959
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:02,880
from that role and if you're interested

960
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:04,410
take note of the gaps you have alright I

961
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,660
want to move over to this type of role

962
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:08,490
I'm strong in some of these areas but I

963
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:10,410
need to fill these other ones out now

964
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:13,529
you can go to your boss and say hey look

965
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:15,750
we need to do this role here's the

966
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:18,540
things we need to know here's a training

967
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:20,940
right this training teaches us these

968
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,680
exact knowledge skills and abilities and

969
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,299
I have the money to go alright that's a

970
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,240
really good way to do it except instead

971
00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:30,030
of hey send me to Vegas is summer why

972
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:31,618
cuz training because CPEs

973
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,599
cuz whisper reason this is way more

974
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:34,740
effective and fill in the gaps this is

975
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,420
the other time I flash over to the

976
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:42,149
spreadsheet so if I go to the table of

977
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:44,400
contents I did this in advance so this

978
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:46,380
should be fine so securely provision

979
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,589
right if there was a system

980
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:53,190
administrator role here what's up oh

981
00:37:48,589 --> 00:37:55,589
yeah sure yeah thank you all right

982
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:57,030
so under securely provision if I scroll

983
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:59,040
down they don't call it Systems

984
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:01,440
Administrator they call it systems

985
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:07,079
development right and then the system

986
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:09,390
developer has different tasks that sound

987
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,690
and look a lot like cysts what we would

988
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,450
call it system admin

989
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:15,790
and if I look through the list of

990
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:30,310
knowledge skills and abilities I may

991
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:32,730
find one that I marked pick one yeah oh

992
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:36,640
I did okay skill no Marcus bill

993
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:38,619
all right so hey skill and discerning

994
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,750
the protection needs of information

995
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:43,030
security systems and networks hey I'm

996
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:48,550
pretty good that let's go look and see

997
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:49,750
what other roles may I can build off

998
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,950
that skill and I can get better at it

999
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,109
I've already done this so I know that

1000
00:38:50,950 --> 00:39:00,328
there's other roles don't make me a liar

1001
00:38:53,109 --> 00:39:02,578
mr. spreadsheet they find all of them in

1002
00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:13,780
the whole workbook

1003
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:17,230
just one quick find all places all now

1004
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:19,270
so here that particular skill comes up

1005
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,980
in other jobs I know I'm good at it and

1006
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:22,210
I want to build off of that all right

1007
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,810
well first one something called an

1008
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:28,060
author authorizing official next

1009
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:29,650
security control assessor hmm sounds

1010
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,630
interesting conduct independent

1011
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,980
comprehensive assessments of the

1012
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:35,710
management operational technical

1013
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:37,390
security controls they need to know the

1014
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,010
thing I'm already good at let me go take

1015
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,810
a look and see what are the other skills

1016
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:43,240
knowledge and abilities I need to build

1017
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:45,400
out to really go and do that role

1018
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,169
effectively I can go look at the tasks

1019
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,089
and say yeah that is actually something

1020
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:51,190
I'd be interested in right this is a way

1021
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:52,900
where you can take control and start

1022
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,410
preparing for whatever you want to do

1023
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,020
next

1024
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:58,770
alright that's one useful thing about

1025
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:01,930
this tool right and that's how you do it

1026
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:03,430
start with what you're strong at and

1027
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,839
decide where you want to go you want to

1028
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,669
get better at what you're doing or do

1029
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:10,509
you want to move on to the next thing so

1030
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:12,640
oh okay boom I transitioned see what I

1031
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:16,030
did there right from that to resumes and

1032
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,190
I did that for a reason right that's how

1033
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:22,510
it really happens in life but it goes

1034
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:24,230
from say my resume to oh my god I just

1035
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:26,600
got fired I need

1036
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:29,690
resume okay that's the way it happens in

1037
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:32,210
life so the problem there too is when

1038
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:34,340
that happens now you're worried you have

1039
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:36,140
a resume that's old you need to create

1040
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:38,570
crafted into a document that's going to

1041
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:40,040
get you interviews and you're worried

1042
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,810
about your bills you worry about your

1043
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,890
family you just got fired you already

1044
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:44,900
what your friends are gonna think about

1045
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:45,799
you you think your spouse your spouse is

1046
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,940
gonna have an opinion

1047
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,500
that's gonna be going through your head

1048
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,910
and now you have to come up with a

1049
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,150
resume that's going to get you

1050
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:54,879
interviews and get you another job so I

1051
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:59,619
just wanted to throw that out there like

1052
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,619
resumes it's like I mentioned before

1053
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:03,950
it's a like I said it's okay you don't

1054
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:04,759
practice doing it just like a lot of

1055
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,830
these other things remember the

1056
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,390
Christmas rule you should write the nice

1057
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:10,580
framework makes it possible to do that

1058
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:11,509
take the things you take the tasks

1059
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:13,369
you're doing and the things you're

1060
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,830
accomplishing and start writing that

1061
00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:18,020
into a document as you go that when it

1062
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:20,950
is time to update your resume you're

1063
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:23,300
ready also remember that the resume is

1064
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:24,500
even if you're not changing jobs keeping

1065
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,630
it up to date is something you can use

1066
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,340
it review time I'd say you do your

1067
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:30,200
review in January of the last year and

1068
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:32,210
you completed a really cool project in

1069
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,379
February like what are the chances

1070
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:35,600
everyone's gonna remember all those

1071
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:37,520
details right so it's a really good

1072
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:43,790
opportunity to say yeah I nailed that

1073
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:46,940
right so let's see two things I want to

1074
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:50,660
say about resumes I'm not sure how I'm

1075
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:51,050
doing on time I lost track hey we're

1076
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:58,520
doing all right

1077
00:41:51,050 --> 00:42:00,500
all right never never brag in resumes or

1078
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,530
interviews about security work you did

1079
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:06,530
that is right around the boundaries of

1080
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:08,420
legal or not legal so don't matter so

1081
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:10,600
that's one that comes up consistently

1082
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:13,430
and people I go and talk to recruiters

1083
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:15,109
hiring managers they still see that

1084
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,520
somewhere along the way people are not

1085
00:42:15,109 --> 00:42:18,049
getting the message that even though it

1086
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,780
shows a particular skill knowledge and

1087
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:22,609
ability you can't use that to get a job

1088
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:25,130
right now the other thing there is I'm

1089
00:42:22,609 --> 00:42:28,069
gonna point out just this this one is my

1090
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:30,970
favorite verb for benefit by modifier

1091
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:33,320
right and that's the that's a model of

1092
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:36,439
how to build the bullets in your resume

1093
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:38,270
and is the best right and if you do verb

1094
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,720
for benefit and benefit his numbers

1095
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:42,320
you get a bonus all right so that's not

1096
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,730
my idea

1097
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,790
that comes from a group called manager

1098
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:49,220
tools it's one of my favorite podcast

1099
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:50,600
resources they do this little side

1100
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:54,830
pendant called career tools and they do

1101
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:57,770
a lot of interview resume advice right

1102
00:42:54,830 --> 00:43:02,630
so verb for benefit by modifier meaning

1103
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:04,490
delivered the project reducing

1104
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:08,440
vulnerability in the Windows

1105
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:12,140
infrastructure by 22 percent by

1106
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:14,390
deploying Nessus reviewing the results

1107
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:19,640
and working with the team to fix the

1108
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:22,460
problem that is direct it is clear it

1109
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:25,100
shows your application of knowledge

1110
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,600
skills and abilities not just a list it

1111
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,640
doesn't say I was responsible for

1112
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:31,880
something but I don't you don't really

1113
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:38,990
know how good I did - hey you killed it

1114
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:41,210
okay so and then we can use the

1115
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:42,620
framework to build on the knowledge

1116
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:45,290
skills and abilities using the same

1117
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:47,509
vocabulary the last point I want to make

1118
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:50,660
there - is if we're using the framework

1119
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:53,030
to build our resumes this can be really

1120
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:55,370
useful for us in the interview process

1121
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:57,680
or the resume process because one thing

1122
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:59,120
that really comes out when interviewing

1123
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,120
and talking with recruiters and hiring

1124
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:04,009
managers is people need to be advocates

1125
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:06,319
for themselves it doesn't always come

1126
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:09,140
naturally to people and you need just

1127
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:13,360
it's nuts it's not sell yourself it's

1128
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:15,589
know how to correctly and accurately and

1129
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:18,770
mana forcefully depending on situation

1130
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:21,020
like communicate all the wonderful

1131
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:23,120
things you did people have a hard time

1132
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:25,220
with that one thing that you can get

1133
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,020
from using the framework is I'm going to

1134
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:29,330
build my resume I'm going to track how

1135
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:31,190
I'm progressing I learned this I filled

1136
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,930
out that role I filled out that role I

1137
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:35,660
studied this my home I didn't just do a

1138
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:37,759
home lab I did a home lab to acquire

1139
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:40,549
this knowledge and skill and it worked

1140
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,160
right being objective about it helps us

1141
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:44,570
be better advocates for ourselves so

1142
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,370
this is it

1143
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:47,720
this is pretty much the end of the

1144
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,109
presentation and I want to pull it all

1145
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,689
together

1146
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:52,099
so throughout the presentation I've been

1147
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:53,539
using chairs

1148
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:56,809
right that's just sort of a common

1149
00:44:53,539 --> 00:44:59,420
picture anybody here see the pun in this

1150
00:44:56,809 --> 00:45:01,729
one there's a pun up there

1151
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:04,369
maybe see it anyone give a shot shout

1152
00:45:01,729 --> 00:45:07,339
out the pun so we're talking about

1153
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:07,640
changing careers maybe those are musical

1154
00:45:07,339 --> 00:45:12,349
chairs

1155
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:14,479
oh I lied I do I've had one more joke

1156
00:45:12,349 --> 00:45:15,799
all right so making a change remember

1157
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:18,799
that when you're making a change it's

1158
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:20,119
not always between organizations right

1159
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,799
sometimes we're making a change it's

1160
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:24,079
about getting a promotion internally

1161
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:26,140
being ready is critically important so

1162
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:29,180
you know the piece this all together

1163
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:31,339
examine a job description and change it

1164
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:34,219
to be nice if you find something out

1165
00:45:31,339 --> 00:45:35,239
there you think you want it go through

1166
00:45:34,219 --> 00:45:36,829
the effort not that you're gonna throw

1167
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:38,269
this back in their face and said you did

1168
00:45:36,829 --> 00:45:41,690
a really crappy job description here's a

1169
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:43,308
better one no no no no but take the job

1170
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:46,009
description look at what they're saying

1171
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:48,650
match it up to this the NIST nice

1172
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:50,449
cybersecurity framework and break down

1173
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:52,819
here's the tasks here the knowledge

1174
00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:55,699
skills and abilities do I fit do I match

1175
00:45:52,819 --> 00:45:58,699
yes I do right and you can phrase your

1176
00:45:55,699 --> 00:46:00,589
resume in a way that emphasizes hey I

1177
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:04,160
can do the things you need I can do the

1178
00:46:00,589 --> 00:46:05,328
things you need right show that you have

1179
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,489
those knowledge skills and abilities

1180
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:09,829
where you fall short right you're ready

1181
00:46:07,489 --> 00:46:11,719
in an interview to say look I know that

1182
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:13,880
you need this task and here's the things

1183
00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:15,019
I need to learn to do that

1184
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,699
hey and even before this interview

1185
00:46:15,019 --> 00:46:18,198
kicked off I already started the home

1186
00:46:16,699 --> 00:46:21,529
lab on this it's gonna teach me these

1187
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:22,670
skills that's an amazing amazing and

1188
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:26,390
impressive thing to say to an

1189
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:28,779
interviewer these things can all help

1190
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:33,469
you be advocates for yourself so I

1191
00:46:28,779 --> 00:46:36,410
picked this tool because it has the

1192
00:46:33,469 --> 00:46:39,319
potential to both help people looking

1193
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:40,609
for work and hiring managers right if

1194
00:46:39,319 --> 00:46:43,038
you talk to people that actually doing

1195
00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:45,140
this the people that are hiring or

1196
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:46,880
having a better and more successful time

1197
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,319
going to their management and getting

1198
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,630
funding for positions because they're

1199
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:53,239
more clearly defined they're having less

1200
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:55,819
situations where they have to completely

1201
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:57,920
ghost candidate which really hurts

1202
00:46:55,819 --> 00:47:00,529
I got a scribed resume this like little

1203
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,989
darts of hope and every time those

1204
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:05,119
things just fall onto deaf ears it's

1205
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:05,870
like it's really hurtful to me to even

1206
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,090
think that it has

1207
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:09,920
so all right are there any questions I

1208
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:10,940
have some frequently asked questions if

1209
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,560
you don't have any questions I'll go

1210
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:22,010
through those but any questions about

1211
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:24,440
resumes hiring getting hired we got too

1212
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:29,330
many words too many words that don't

1213
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:32,630
mean anything right so the to the

1214
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:34,040
one-page resume is is okay here's the

1215
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:35,570
way I like to put it in the past you

1216
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,820
used to get penalized for having more

1217
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:39,290
than one page it's not necessarily

1218
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:41,270
better to have more than one page but

1219
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,620
you don't get penalized anymore but

1220
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:45,170
here's the other if the counterpoint to

1221
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:47,270
that is people don't really read the

1222
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:49,280
whole thing people mostly read the front

1223
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:50,960
page and the only page and sometimes

1224
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,550
they'll skim the other stuff but for the

1225
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,260
most part you know no one has the time

1226
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:55,970
to read all the resumes all the way

1227
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:57,800
through so the MiG that's one of the

1228
00:47:55,970 --> 00:48:00,560
biggest mistakes people make is one a

1229
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,420
lot of meaningless adjectives words and

1230
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,970
fluff talk about responsibilities

1231
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:06,020
responsibilities in giant paragraph and

1232
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:06,950
when you go look at it you really don't

1233
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:09,230
know how well they did there's no

1234
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:13,149
accomplishment so that's one big mistake

1235
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:15,410
the other one is contact information and

1236
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:17,540
contact information and not being ready

1237
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:19,940
for the automated systems it's not as

1238
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:21,650
interesting and there's no framework fix

1239
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:23,300
for that but some people put their

1240
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:24,890
contact information and headers and gets

1241
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,150
chopped off some people send in resumes

1242
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:28,580
with this intention of a cover letter

1243
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:29,720
and they get separated so the hiring

1244
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:31,460
manager doesn't have the contact

1245
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:33,140
information happens a lot the other

1246
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:35,300
thing is all of these automated systems

1247
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:37,549
are not ready for your table and your

1248
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:39,080
graphic and your maybe even your font

1249
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:41,000
alright so having a resume that's

1250
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:43,819
basically you can a version of it that's

1251
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,410
text only it's pretty handy for those

1252
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:47,300
situations too so people make those

1253
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:51,200
mistakes so those are those are common

1254
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:54,380
ones spelling mistakes uh-oh

1255
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,569
lying right

1256
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:59,230
and then that maybe there's different

1257
00:48:56,570 --> 00:49:01,580
kinds of lies right there's the I

1258
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:04,460
listing out of technology

1259
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:05,870
Ubuntu 1604 right if you want to be that

1260
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:08,120
specific and then when you get down to

1261
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:09,109
it did anyone did you what do you do

1262
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,150
with it

1263
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:13,610
I installed it and then uninstalled it

1264
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:16,040
installed Fedora like it's not a lie

1265
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:18,320
because you did you knew a little bit

1266
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,788
about a Muthu but but it's lie like

1267
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,349
those kind of things with with

1268
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:23,719
tech that comes into play and the other

1269
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:28,130
one is listing out technology that you

1270
00:49:23,719 --> 00:49:29,839
did a really long time ago right and you

1271
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:32,809
haven't used in an updated like me for

1272
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:37,279
example I have a GCF a right which is

1273
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:40,759
sands and forensics 508 sore a

1274
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:43,309
certification right I don't use it right

1275
00:49:40,759 --> 00:49:44,989
III did digital forensics for like a few

1276
00:49:43,309 --> 00:49:46,309
months and then life coincidences

1277
00:49:44,989 --> 00:49:47,630
brought me over to another job and I

1278
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:49,489
haven't done digital forensics in a

1279
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:51,409
while I dropped that from my resume I

1280
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:54,499
can include it it wouldn't be a lie

1281
00:49:51,409 --> 00:49:56,659
exactly but it'd be a lie because I

1282
00:49:54,499 --> 00:49:58,788
don't keep it up I don't do it and it'd

1283
00:49:56,659 --> 00:50:00,739
be disingenuous to say hey I'm a

1284
00:49:58,789 --> 00:50:02,239
forensics expert just because I took the

1285
00:50:00,739 --> 00:50:02,929
class and did forensics for six months

1286
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:06,049
okay

1287
00:50:02,929 --> 00:50:07,609
that's lies I mean obvious lies but then

1288
00:50:06,049 --> 00:50:08,989
there's those other like two other

1289
00:50:07,609 --> 00:50:16,029
questions are there thoughts comments

1290
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:16,029
horror stories yeah we got

1291
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:26,190
I'm happy to share this with anybody and

1292
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:28,019
I don't really have a clear delivery

1293
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,730
mechanism right now but I would be happy

1294
00:50:28,019 --> 00:50:35,879

1300
00:50:43,289 --> 00:50:47,700
where people are mentoring other people

if you want to check out that survey I

1305
00:50:53,849 --> 00:50:59,700
mentioned it's pin to that D psi book

1306
00:50:57,319 --> 00:51:01,288
and then I always like to emphasize at

1307
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:04,649
the end of this whenever I talk about

1308
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:06,869
this let's suppose you don't need

1309
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:08,450
resumes you're not hiring and you're not

1310
00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:12,210
looking to get hired

1311
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:13,828
check this out anyway like one everyone

1312
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:15,299
needs career management the two there

1313
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:17,180
are people around you who at the

1314
00:51:15,299 --> 00:51:20,910
beginning and I'm seeing in my research

1315
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:23,328
are so like victims of a process that's

1316
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:25,348
really broken so even if that's not you

1317
00:51:23,329 --> 00:51:27,029
knowing that you can go to that person

1318
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:30,839
and say hey I know you feel kind of lost

1319
00:51:27,029 --> 00:51:32,250
but why don't you go check this out pick

1320
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:35,430
something maybe you want to change to

1321
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:37,349
and then go find a mentor mentor to kind

1322
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:39,450
of get you go into that like take a

1323
00:51:37,349 --> 00:51:40,859
little bit about what you learn and try

1324
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:42,029
to help someone with it and and

1325
00:51:40,859 --> 00:51:44,069
hopefully it helped you a little bit to

1326
00:51:42,029 --> 00:51:46,319
hear this but even if it doesn't really

1327
00:51:44,069 --> 00:51:47,730
apply directly at least you know about

1328
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:50,250
this tool you know what's out there and

1329
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:52,049
use it to help somebody else maybe but

1330
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:54,349
are there any other questions or yeah

1331
00:51:52,049 --> 00:51:54,349
what do you got

1332
00:51:58,369 --> 00:52:01,670
okay yeah

1333
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:13,310
so no that is not what it's about it is

1334
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:17,390
about the organization needs a role

1335
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:20,150
filled it they classified in certain

1336
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:23,839
ways and sometimes there's a sub one but

1337
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:26,000
there is no concept of intro junior

1338
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:27,799
senior it's not a thing you do the task

1339
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,560
you get the job done I don't care if

1340
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:34,180
you're 14 years old or 65 I don't care

1341
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:38,210
if you have one hand or two right that's

1342
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:40,848
it's it's disingenuous and doesn't match

1343
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:43,070
the real process for how we get people

1344
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:45,380
to do work and how we work as a team and

1345
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:47,359
how we get two people working together

1346
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:49,040
to accomplish something that four people

1347
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:50,839
alone would take like those are real

1348
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:54,680
things that this doesn't address but in

1349
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:56,920
terms of like levo and intro you can go

1350
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:59,810
after anything on here that you want and

1351
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:03,890
if you read the descriptions there is

1352
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:05,960
something here that sounds like C so in

1353
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:09,589
the operating govern section overseeing

1354
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:11,500
govern and if you look to test the

1355
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:15,980
knowledge skills and the abilities

1356
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:19,369
they're difficult to learn practice and

1357
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:22,250
achieve because it would take someone

1358
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:24,349
with the experience in both like project

1359
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:26,960
management and technology to combine

1360
00:53:24,349 --> 00:53:28,670
them to fill the role of C so so you can

1361
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,589
read them over and say like that looks

1362
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:34,579
really cool let me look at something

1363
00:53:30,589 --> 00:53:35,480
else under overseeing govern and what do

1364
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:37,280
you know the knowledge skills and

1365
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:39,349
abilities tend to overlap a little bit I

1366
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,609
want to work my way up to C so but I'm

1367
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:42,109
going to do it on the start managing

1368
00:53:40,609 --> 00:53:44,660
some project let's do that first

1369
00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:46,970
right it's up to you to pick that path

1370
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:48,980
that's also another situation where a

1371
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:50,930
mentor would be it would be a big help

1372
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:52,400
right I saw a hand over here to a little

1373
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:56,560
bit someone else have another thought

1374
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,560
comment concerned horror story

1375
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:16,890
yeah yes that is coming out of my

1376
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:18,180
research is something I heard in

1377
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:21,170
conversation it's coming out of my

1378
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:24,149
research happens way too much I blame

1379
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:27,870
the resources they have available to

1380
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:29,850
create good job descriptions or to know

1381
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:31,620
what they really need right so that's

1382
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:33,950
why I like this tool right if a person

1383
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:39,060
that situation said I need these things

1384
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:41,220
they can go to this tool and validate

1385
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:43,259
that for verify it then they'll have job

1386
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:44,970
descriptions that are way closer to what

1387
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:47,370
they need and that fishing expedition of

1388
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:49,980
let's get a let's get four analysts and

1389
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:51,330
then just say they they start getting

1390
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,830
some resumes and then the budget gets

1391
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,960
cut the revenue was down and then it's

1392
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:57,120
like I'll never mind I forget it like

1393
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,320
that'll happen less of it but you're

1394
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,319
right it happens and it happens a lot

1395
00:55:15,689 --> 00:55:22,678
okay so the recruit their crew ting in

1396
00:55:19,299 --> 00:55:27,669
InfoSec has a variety of approaches

1397
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:31,059
right and not all the recruiters act

1398
00:55:27,669 --> 00:55:35,469
like that a lot of some recruiters will

1399
00:55:31,059 --> 00:55:38,169
write they will there again okay so back

1400
00:55:35,469 --> 00:55:39,699
to my root causes what got you here

1401
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:42,729
won't get you there meaning they're

1402
00:55:39,699 --> 00:55:44,709
applying a legacy approach to a new

1403
00:55:42,729 --> 00:55:46,118
thing and it's causing everyone a

1404
00:55:44,709 --> 00:55:49,198
disservice they're taking an approach

1405
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:51,640
for filling positions in jobs where

1406
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:53,049
there's maybe a lot of people who could

1407
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,919
do the job so you want to keep it secret

1408
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:57,969
who it's for and what it includes or

1409
00:55:55,919 --> 00:56:00,969
last thing here I guess it's gotta be my

1410
00:55:57,969 --> 00:56:02,819
last point some recruiters will take and

1411
00:56:00,969 --> 00:56:09,039
they'll try to build a bank of resumes

1412
00:56:02,819 --> 00:56:11,410
without any jobs right and then one they

1413
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:13,869
have you committed to them and two they

1414
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:15,699
have some ideas I mean they talk of jobs

1415
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:17,709
that are gonna come up company X is

1416
00:56:15,699 --> 00:56:19,509
about to ramp up on project Y and

1417
00:56:17,709 --> 00:56:21,189
they're gonna need some people soon and

1418
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:23,859
they're gonna be ready and all those

1419
00:56:21,189 --> 00:56:27,729
practices hurt people I would I would

1420
00:56:23,859 --> 00:56:29,679
advise not to participate or to have the

1421
00:56:27,729 --> 00:56:31,899
correct level of expectations if you

1422
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:33,159
want to participate you understand what

1423
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:35,369
you're getting yourself into when you

1424
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:37,959
work with recruiter who works like that

1425
00:56:35,369 --> 00:56:40,319
but you're right that happens and it it

1426
00:56:37,959 --> 00:56:43,169
really ends up just hurting people yeah

1427
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:46,479
