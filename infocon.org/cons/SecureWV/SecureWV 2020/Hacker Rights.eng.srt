completely dedicated to all the hackers

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,360
who've been scared to disclose

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,480
to all the hackers who've been

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,160
prosecuted for trying to do something

11
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,039
good

12
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,960
or doing their actual job like they're

13
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,519
actually hired to do these things

14
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,880
and to all the people who are in the

15
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,560
fight to bring rights for hackers

16
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,240

17
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,160

security

40
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,560
and also the founder we are hackers

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,680
formerly known as

42
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,680
woman hackers and when i'm not doing

angela and basically

49
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,400
we read books um every month reading a

50
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:30,960
new book

51
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,680
and every week at 5 pm pacific time on

52
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,960
tuesday

53
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,360
we gather around and talk about the book

54
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,960
but also those that are mentioned in the

55
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,000
book and the author

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,399
does the 10r sessions which is fantastic

57
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,920
because you can actually ask all the

58
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,439
other questions that are between the

59
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,880
lines of the words

60
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,119
um so it's a lot of fun anyone can join

61
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,799
uh one thing that's not on there

62
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,240
is that i'm also the co-founder of

63
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,479
hacking is not a crime

64
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,040
with brian he's my co-founder and we'll

65
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,840
dive a little bit

66
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,920
more about how he's not a crime in this

67
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,680
talk so you have a better understanding

68
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,040
of what we're trying to do

69
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,600
to help out the hacker community if you

70
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,200
have any questions about me

71
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,479
at all about what i do in infosec or

72
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,400
outside of infosec you can find all of

73
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,720
that

74
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,760
on my website at climate.com

75
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,599
my twitter and instagram my dms are

76
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,080
always open but feel free to follow too

77
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,599
all right now let's dive into the good

78
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,200
stuff the real

79
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,800
reason why you guys are here we're going

80
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,959
to talk about the current landscape

81
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,720
and i know this is a really really

82
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,800
really scary subject

83
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,640
but we're going to do this together and

84
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,480
i'm hoping that i can make you laugh

85
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,599
once in a while

86
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,360
even though my jokes are terrible most

87
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,680
of the time but let's do this

88
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,599
so first things first you may have

89
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,680
remembered the equifax breach

90
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,440
well it impacted 147 million americans

91
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,560
but did you know about six months before

92
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,120
the breach

93
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,239
occurred a secure researcher or like i

94
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,760
like to use the term

95
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,120
hacker reported this vulnerability

96
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,159
to equifax but it was ignored and so it

97
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,319
wasn't fixed and so when that breach

98
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,920
made major headlines

99
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,159
the upsetting part was that this could

100
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,120
have been avoided

101
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,440
if they just listened to what was being

102
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,280
disclosed thanks siri

103
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,360
um all right we'll keep going on this

104
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,440
the other thing is capital one so

105
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,400
capital one

106
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,480
in general if you did hear about this

107
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,319
bridge uh back in the day was that the

108
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,519
federal complaint it

109
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,959
showed that the breach took places

110
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,760
across march and april 2019

111
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,000
but capital one was not aware of this at

112
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,920
all until a secure researcher

113
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,599
once again also known as a hacker uh

114
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,959
basically reported this situation that

115
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,120
he or she saw on july 17th

116
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,319
and july 17th is uh

117
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,040
when a public github page was displaying

118
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,840
something that looked

119
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,200
awfully like private data

120
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,159
for capital one so the one thing is to

121
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,400
note is that if the secure researcher

122
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,920
never actually like uh notified capital

123
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,280
one they would have not known that this

124
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,560
was out there for

125
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,120
you know however long and that's one of

126
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,798
the things that we have to talk about

127
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,320
today

128
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
is that what happened if no one actually

129
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,240
reported the breach

130
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,639
and the reality of it is that it happens

131
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,280
all

132
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,320
the time because right now

133
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,479
one thing you should know about is that

134
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,000
sixty percent of researchers don't

135
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,759
report vulnerabilities

136
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,240
um and this came from um a discussion

137
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,720
that amit elizari was doing when she was

138
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,320
researching about the possibilities of

139
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,919
having safe harbor for the hacker

140
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,759
community

141
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,280
now one of the things with that you need

142
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,880
to also understand

143
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,080
is that it wasn't just her research

144
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,960
about 60

145
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,800
researchers don't report vulnerabilities

146
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,199
but is to note that the reason why is

147
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,080
because they're afraid

148
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,680
of being prosecuted another report that

149
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,600
came out was hacker one

150
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,160
so hacker one came out report in 2018

151
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,919
that stated that one out of four

152
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,560
hackers are afraid to disclose a

153
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,080
vulnerability if they don't have

154
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,199
vulnerability disclosure policies but

155
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,120
those that did end up reporting the

156
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,479
vulnerability

157
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,199
um ended up doing it through you know

158
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,199
social media channels

159
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,440
and the one thing to note is that those

160
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,120
that run the social media channels are

161
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,720
usually marketing

162
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,400
so marketing doesn't really have

163
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,240
communication too much with security so

164
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,919
they probably don't know what to do with

165
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:32,320
it

166
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,639
however they do see pr situations

167
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,840
forming

168
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,720
so the thing is is that so that that one

169
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,000
out of four

170
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,360
that do report it and they send a dm

171
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,400
through linkedin or through twitter

172
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,639
it ends up becoming a really really

173
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,400
difficult situation

174
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,479
because what ends up happening is it's

175
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,560
either ignored

176
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,120
which you know that's way better than

177
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,000
the other one

178
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,840
which is being misinter interrupted

179
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,280
now one thing you need to know about

180
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,759
that is that then there becomes the

181
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,319
threats

182
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,639
the legal threats that does occur so

183
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,240
remember that 60 percent raters don't

184
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,440
report vulnerabilities because they're

185
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,160
scared

186
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,680
of being prosecuted it's very much a

187
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,000
reality because right now there is no

188
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,960
laws that protect you

189
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,520
so why are hackers scared besides the

190
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,919
constant fear being prosecuted the other

191
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,039
thing you need to know

192
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,919
about the hacker community is that even

193
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,919
when we try to disclose something

194
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,240
sometimes it takes hours days weeks and

195
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,360
then we get to a point where

196
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,039
is it even worth it because it's gonna

197
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,600
put me in jeopardy regardless

198
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,000
but i want to do my job which is the

199
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
reason why i'm in this field still

200
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,280
is that i want to protect people that's

201
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,960
why i do what i do

202
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,639
it's because curiosity of course but

203
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,800
also i like to protect people

204
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
and so that is the thing we need to

205
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,639
think about is the fact that hackers are

206
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,759
scared because of

207
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,199
outdated laws and the lack of having

208
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:01,759
rights

209
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,919
is the other one when trying to disclose

210
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,000
something it's a nightmare

211
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,039
and so that's why we need to

212
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,720
understand this situation a little bit

213
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,800
further because the thing that you need

214
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,759
to understand

215
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,639
at this very time is that the laws that

216
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,199
are

217
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,240
used to prosecute hackers in the u.s

218
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,120
the ones you have to worry about is the

219
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,319
fact that

220
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,440
they themselves are so outrageously out

221
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,240
of date

222
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,039
that it hurts you but it's being used by

223
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,479
companies

224
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,360
so companies are using it to prosecute

225
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,800
hackers

226
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,400
it's not really federal government

227
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,800
anymore since 2013 they've been

228
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,560
uh the doj has been doing whatever they

229
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,000
can to protect ethical hackers

230
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,560
but the thing is at the end of the day

231
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,599
it's happening

232
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,479
across our country and it's happening in

233
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,080
local

234
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,280
counties also state but

235
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,759
big companies are the number one abuser

236
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,960
of this law

237
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,000
called the cfa now if you don't know the

238
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,919
cfa we will dive into it but it's

239
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,240
the computer fraud abuse act it is the

240
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,280
law used to prosecute hacking

241
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,120
even though it does not state hacker or

242
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,039
hacking anywhere in it

243
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,800
but the thing you need to note is about

244
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,440
this case so this is an example of how a

245
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,639
company

246
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,000
can abuse and use a hacker

247
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,560
so the dji as you know is a really

248
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,800
really well-known uh manufacturer of

249
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,840
droids

250
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,599
um the things that you need to

251
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,200
understand about this one

252
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,880
is that um so kevin he basically

253
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,120
came across a bug bounty program that

254
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,559
was run by dji

255
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,080
meaning it was run by them in-house not

256
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,160
through like bug crowd hacker one no

257
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,360
third party

258
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,800
so that's already letting you know there

259
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,040
might be a problem here because

260
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,920
managing a bug bounding program is

261
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,519
really really hard

262
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,160
you need to have at least one person to

263
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,120
manage it all

264
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,640
unless you work with those platforms now

265
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,320
there were signs throughout the whole

266
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,839
thing at the beginning that this could

267
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,200
be a bad thing

268
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,440
but cji they created their own blood

269
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,880
boundary program

270
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,000
and kevin he saw the scope and

271
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,839
he wanted to make sure that that scope

272
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,240
is correct so he sent an email to them

273
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,959
and it took them two weeks get this two

274
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:21,600
weeks

275
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,279
to respond say yes that is all in scope

276
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,480
even though it was just something that's

277
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,640
already on their website what's in scope

278
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,120
it took them two weeks to confirm what's

279
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,959
already on their website

280
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,760
boom that is your major red flag that

281
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,000
this

282
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,880
could be a problem the fact it took two

283
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,800
weeks that means they're not managing

284
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,480
this right

285
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,000
anyway so then he then proceeds to

286
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,120
submit his disclosure and it ended up

287
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,760
being

288
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,720
him getting well an award of thirty

289
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,800
thousand dollars for his fighting

290
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,720
and when it came to the contract for him

291
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,440
to sign to receive the funds

292
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,160
it offered absolutely zero protection

293
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,279
for him

294
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,120
at that moment kevin had to make the

295
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,560
decision of

296
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,760
do i risk at all for thirty thousand

297
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,360
dollars

298
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,440
or do i walk away from thirty thousand

299
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,519
dollars knowing that at least i will be

300
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,120
safe from being prosecuted if ever

301
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,839
and so he did the probably the most

302
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,040
logical choice

303
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,959
which was not take the money

304
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,040
he didn't take the money but dji

305
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,959
immediately saw him as a threat

306
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,200
because he didn't want to take the money

307
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,720
or sign the contract

308
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,399
they were worried that this could become

309
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,640
a really really bad pr situation for

310
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,120
them

311
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,720
if he were to disclose it publicly so

312
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,040
what they did was that even though he

313
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,320
basically was like okay

314
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,560
fine all right you guys fix that

315
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,399
vulnerability i'm not taking your money

316
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,760
walks away moves on with his life

317
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,200
he gets something which is basically

318
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,320
a lawsuit saying that he went

319
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,760
out of scope and even though he

320
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,240
confirmed okay he had a paper trail he

321
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,760
confirmed it

322
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,959
that he was within scope that basically

323
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,160
that he broke the cfa so computer fraud

324
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,279
be stacked

325
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,680
so he himself then was like okay fine

326
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,279
you want to play this game i didn't want

327
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,959
to do this way i didn't want to be dirty

328
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,360
i didn't want to disclose anything here

329
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,000
but here you go so he puts on a blog

330
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,720
everything

331
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,440
i mean all the communications he's ever

332
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,920
had with dji and you can look through it

333
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,079
and some of the responses from dji

334
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,519
itself

335
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,760
are within the chain of the email which

336
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,360
is hilarious to read

337
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,519
at the same time really scary to read

338
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,000
because they legitimately just called

339
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,320
him

340
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,120
out saying he is a problem he's going to

341
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,000
be a pr

342
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,920
nightmare when he said he wasn't going

343
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,760
to sign that contract

344
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,920
so the takeaway from that story you

345
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,440
should know is that

346
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,760
even when you're doing the right thing

347
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,639
and you're doing

348
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,880
all the right things companies will

349
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,360
still take advantage of you for pr

350
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,600
purposes

351
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,120
now the other thing is to note that

352
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,440
sometimes it's also when you are

353
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,760
hired and you work for a company that

354
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,680
you can also be prosecuted

355
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,519
such as the coal fire case that happened

356
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,760
last year if you don't notice that in

357
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,120
september of last year

358
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,760
the iowa state basically asked coal fire

359
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,160
to do some penetration testing to see

360
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,320
if you know if the staff could gain

361
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,720
access to sense of data or equipment

362
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,279
so two coal fire employees then

363
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,160
proceeded

364
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,880
to try to get into the dallas courthouse

365
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,320
but they found the door was actually

366
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,839
open so then they decided to close the

367
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,480
door

368
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,880
to check to see if it would lock and if

369
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,839
an alarm would go

370
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,160
off and so when they attempted to open

371
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,920
it the alarm did go off which is great

372
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,160
that means they have security there

373
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,399
the problem is is that is that at that

374
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,600
moment of course there's a follow

375
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,240
protocol

376
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,839
and the protocol is that they wait for

377
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,920
the police to show up

378
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,399
and they have their papers paper showing

379
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,680
that they were hired

380
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,880
to look into this situation

381
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,399
now most of the police were like oh

382
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,920
that's really cool how did you do that

383
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,240
oh that's such a cool thing that you do

384
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,399
the bad thing is that a local sheriff

385
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,160
showed up and was like

386
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,720
no you're going to jail so they actually

387
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
had to spend a night in jail

388
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,560
because of basically

389
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,120
the sheriff wanted to play his own role

390
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,000
book

391
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
um you should note that the charges were

392
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,240
later dropped this year in january

393
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,000
but the thing is it's another example of

394
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
even when you are hired

395
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,760
and doing what you're you're doing all

396
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,600
the right things you can still have to

397
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,399
deal with this situation

398
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,760
because the reality is is that still to

399
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,120
this day

400
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,279
everyone knows that you need the hacker

401
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,240
community to help

402
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,839
out to protect you to become more secure

403
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,920
but the reality is it is that we're also

404
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,320
battling this idea of what is a hacker

405
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,959
versus an

406
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,680
attacker and the unfortunate bit is that

407
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,440
most of the public perception still sees

408
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,000
hackers

409
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,240
as devious people and thus organizations

410
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,560
and also program managers are a little

411
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,399
bit afraid to work with the hacker

412
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,040
community

413
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,440
because they are afraid of us but the

414
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,639
other thing is they need to understand

415
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,519
is that we are

416
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,600
terribly frightened of them because they

417
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,880
have more protection

418
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,959
than we do when we try to disclose

419
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,880
something so even though they're like oh

420
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,720
please disclose something to us

421
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,600
we're also scared to disclose something

422
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,560
to you

423
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,880
um but also a lot of organizations still

424
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
don't have disclosure policies and this

425
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,680
becomes a huge

426
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,880
problem now i've set the scene for you

427
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,639
to know what the current landscape looks

428
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,839
like and we're gonna go a little bit

429
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,600
more in detail but i know this is a

430
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
really scary subject

431
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,320
so here are some puppies to lift your

432
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,120
spirits

433
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,760
there is a cat in there and i would say

434
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,279
it's kind of like a where's waldo game

435
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,480
but in reality of it

436
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,199
it's pretty obvious where it is but you

437
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:55,680
know

438
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,440
for all the cat lovers here you go and

439
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,600
i'm sorry for all the dogs instead but i

440
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,680
am a dog lover and i have two shivas at

441
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,639
home so

442
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,440
and they're not on here all right let's

443
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,639
continue deeper at you guys

444
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,240
so i'm gonna dive a little bit more into

445
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,600
that public perceptions perception

446
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,800
situation

447
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,959
about the hacker community now the one

448
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,880
thing you should note is that the public

449
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,839
perception of

450
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,040
us is based around imagery

451
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,720
but also language but the thing you

452
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,800
should know is that anytime you type in

453
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,320
criminal hacker versus

454
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,279
ethical hacker you get the exact same

455
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,399
images

456
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,839
dark hooded figures it's supposed to

457
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,279
wear a ski mask

458
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,440
which is very interesting but the thing

459
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,399
is to understand

460
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,199
is that because of these images that are

461
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,399
out there

462
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,160
the public doesn't know that there's two

463
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,240
very very different groups here

464
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,320
there's hackers and there's attackers

465
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,600
and this might be the good time to

466
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,560
explain to you the differences

467
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,959
and what it does it comes down to one

468
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,160
part

469
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,279
what is the goal or the intent of the

470
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,079
person

471
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,120
they use the same skills both parties to

472
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,120
get what they need to get to

473
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,240
but their ill intent is different

474
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,120
so ill intent is for those that are

475
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,480
attackers

476
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,759
attackers goals are to collect money

477
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,199
or data that is their goal

478
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,079
is to have some sort of power in a sense

479
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,040
to utilize

480
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,959
and abuse it for their own needs

481
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,160
now when it comes to a hacker their

482
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,720
intent

483
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,240
is to serve and protect meaning

484
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,480
wanting to help out and be the everyday

485
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,120
heroes behind scenes

486
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,600
so the intent is very different from two

487
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,720
parties

488
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,360
and though sometimes we like to compare

489
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,720
the two parties as

490
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,160
one is a locker the other one is a

491
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,320
burglar because the reality of it is

492
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
that they use exact same skill sets to

493
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,480
get to their goal

494
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,399
but the one thing you should take away

495
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,240
from that is that one does it with

496
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,440
permission or doesn't and also doesn't

497
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,399
exploit

498
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,839
so even so for example if i'm looking at

499
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,520
vulnerabilities i'm going to do what's

500
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,280
within the scope and i'm only going to

501
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,160
exploit

502
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,520
if you give me permission now the other

503
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:13,919
thing

504
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,640
is that if you are an attacker you're

505
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,280
not doing

506
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,000
any of that what you're doing is i'm

507
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,280
going to find that vulnerability i'm

508
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,720
going to utilize that vulnerability and

509
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,480
i'm going to get to my goal

510
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,319
now another thing to think about is that

511
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,960
the uh hackers are the ones that are out

512
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,520
there

513
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,200
trying to prevent the attackers from

514
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,280
taking advantage and having their own

515
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,039
gains

516
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,120
that is the differences of the two but

517
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,720
if you see in those images they look

518
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,919
like the exactly the same

519
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,160
people and this is a problem that we're

520
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,039
facing

521
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,960
because it's not just images that's

522
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,039
interfering here but also the language

523
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,240
as well

524
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,200
we still use the terms hackers instead

525
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,240
of using the term

526
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,679
attackers when we're talking about

527
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,360
someone who's committed a com

528
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,480
like a criminal act and this is the

529
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,160
thing that we're dealing with is that

530
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,559
the media doesn't know

531
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,400
or i want to have high hopes that they

532
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,039
don't know that there's a difference

533
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,720
but the thing i want you to take away

534
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,960
from this is that the language

535
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,240
and images themselves they impact

536
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,320
us because public perception basically

537
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,559
allows us to have rights and not have

538
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,600
rights

539
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,039
it's public perception that challenges

540
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,080
us to be able to move forward

541
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,720
because they don't know and how to

542
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,760
spread that knowledge

543
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,080
is the one thing that is the hardest

544
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,120
thing to do

545
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,400
because that means we have to get

546
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,480
certain parties to agree with us

547
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,400
but we want to talk about right now at

548
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,320
this point of this conversation

549
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,480
is there's this thing called socially

550
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,919
constructed beliefs

551
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,400
and a socially constructed belief is

552
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,480
basically the idea

553
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,799
that well it's not an idea it's actually

554
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,240
a research and it's a

555
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,799
term that's used but basically it's the

556
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,760
idea

557
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,280
that whatever that you look at

558
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,320
or read or watch you're

559
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,640
taking in knowledge and information

560
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,400
about how the world works

561
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,320
so socially constructed beliefs are

562
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,840
these beliefs that you have

563
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,440
created based of your surroundings

564
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,360
and this could be watching the news this

565
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,720
could be reading a book this could be

566
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,160
reading an article this could be reading

567
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,280
tweets this could be having a

568
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,480
conversation

569
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,799
the thing is is that these beliefs that

570
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,480
you have

571
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,120
can become really strong because it's

572
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,880
letting you know how the world works so

573
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,799
you're processing information

574
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,960
to see you know how to play the game

575
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,480
the life game of how the world works

576
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,000
but the thing you need to note is that

577
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,760
socially constructive beliefs can also

578
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,160
be false

579
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,280
they can very much be false

580
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,200
many times and so it's really important

581
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,960
to understand how these socially

582
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,480
constructed beliefs

583
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,840
play out when it comes to fear

584
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,160
and for those that know every time i

585
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,760
give a talk i do talk about the brain

586
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,480
because the brain

587
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,400
is really cool because if we know human

588
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,000
behavior then we know how to work

589
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,799
it so let's first dive into the brain

590
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,720
now i want you to know is that socially

591
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,159
constructed beliefs

592
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,880
tend to be stored in your temporal lobe

593
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
which takes sensory information and

594
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
inputs it into long-term working

595
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,080
memories

596
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,400
so this is where you start understanding

597
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,159
how the world works around you

598
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,360
but the thing you need to know is that

599
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,600
within your temporal lobe itself

600
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,240
it's also where your amygdala lays now

601
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,919
the amygdala you may have heard of it is

602
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,919
a fight versus flight mechanism but you

603
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,480
maybe

604
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,960
not know that it's also your mechanism

605
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,799
that shot stranger danger

606
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,640
in other words who's like me who's not

607
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,480
like me so if you never met

608
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,880
someone who is a hacker

609
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,640
you would never know what the real story

610
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,320
is because the reality is everything

611
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,000
that you know about the hacker community

612
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,840
is stuff that you see in the news or

613
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,640
in movies or in books or from other

614
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,559
people gossiping so the thing is

615
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,280
is that that is why a lot of people are

616
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,320
afraid of us

617
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,600
it's because of these socially

618
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,039
constructed beliefs that we are

619
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,720
criminals because that's what's

620
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,840
being told and shared all over the place

621
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,240
and because of that they stored us as

622
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,200
not like me

623
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,919
so stranger danger now i want to take

624
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,440
this a little bit further so you have a

625
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,159
better understanding of how fear works

626
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,480
so what i'm going to do is talk to you

627
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,840
about an example

628
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,799
so imagine when you're growing up that

629
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,400
you turn on the tv

630
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,080
and the person with pink hair you

631
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,080
automatically will always assume

632
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
is a criminal because the person with

633
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,320
pink hair always plays the criminal

634
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,640
or even when you turn on the news you

635
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,919
see someone with pink hair

636
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,720
and you know that person's guilty or any

637
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,000
time there's a criminal

638
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,720
story out there the person has pink hair

639
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,720
so you have this belief now

640
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,760
that every single person that has pink

641
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,720
hair

642
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,120
is a possible danger and it's not like

643
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,000
you because you don't

644
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,919
have pink hair and you don't talk to

645
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,120
anyone with pink hair

646
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,200
so how would you know so

647
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,640
say for example you're walking down the

648
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,159
street and when you're walking down the

649
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:08,880
street

650
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,559
there's someone with pink hair behind

651
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,000
you now

652
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,760
at that point you usually do is you

653
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,120
cross the street

654
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,960
you clutch your bag a little bit closer

655
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,559
or you go into the

656
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,320
closest store to get away

657
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,520
because of this fear but the thing to

658
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,240
note about

659
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,799
fear is that it has to be verified so

660
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,799
going back to the pink hair example is

661
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,720
that so

662
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,240
when there's a person with pink hair

663
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,320
behind you your amygdala is setting off

664
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:38,960
a signal

665
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,200
saying warning warning stranger danger

666
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,799
person would be cares behind you

667
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,679
criminal be careful you should take

668
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:46,480
action

669
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,400
so the amygdala which is completely

670
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,080
subconscious by the way

671
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
then sends a signal to the prefrontal

672
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
cortex and the prefrontal cortex of your

673
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,400
brain works as a ceo it basically uses

674
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,520
logic and rationale to decide whether or

675
00:22:59,520 --> 00:22:59,919
not

676
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,400
it is a threat or what actions to take

677
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,679
if it is

678
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,440
it then would send a signal back to the

679
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,440
magnet to calm down

680
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,480
or to react now

681
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,640
the prefrontal cortex at this moment

682
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,960
with a person with pink hairs behind you

683
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
that may delicious that message saying

684
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
warning stranger danger pink hair behind

685
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,919
you

686
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,520
so the thing is is that now at this

687
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,960
point you're thinking of your three

688
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,520
actions

689
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,960
they usually take cross the street

690
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,039
uh clutch your back or go into a store

691
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,559
now but there's this one moment that

692
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,559
you remember that you came across a

693
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,760
youtube video

694
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,440
and this youtube video itself was

695
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,960
something with pink hair

696
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,120
and this person with pink hair is on

697
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,559
camera basically saying

698
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,840
how hard it is to be someone pink hair

699
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,640
that everyone sees them as a criminal

700
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,960
and that it hurts them

701
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,120
because every time they're walking

702
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,480
sometimes they'll see people clutch

703
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,159
their bag across the street

704
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,679
because they're right behind them and

705
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,520
they're afraid of them

706
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,000
and how much that hurts them because not

707
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,200
only does that

708
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,840
criminal title come up you know come up

709
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,559
every time

710
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,360
the person walks into a room the thing

711
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:11,600
is

712
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,320
is that even that that also prevents

713
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,840
them from being able to do

714
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,880
a lot of things such as getting certain

715
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,440
jobs

716
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,559
or um being able to go in a store

717
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,919
without someone following them in the

718
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,279
store making sure they're not stealing

719
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,559
something

720
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,200
the reality is is that that story

721
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,159
touched you

722
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,360
in a sense that you realize you ask

723
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,400
yourself

724
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,440
huh i wonder if i ever did any of that

725
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,080
or maybe you goes through mine and like

726
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,760
i think i have

727
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,120
or wait

728
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,360
i had definitely done that before oh my

729
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,640
god i'm a terrible person

730
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,279
um so that's what will go through your

731
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,640
mind when you see a video

732
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,520
not everyone but people that um like to

733
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,000
practice

734
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,960
empathy and feel comfortable being wrong

735
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,080
which a lot of humans

736
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,320
don't we don't like to be wrong we are

737
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,279
insecure

738
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,720
beings that are like all over this

739
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,279
planet and we don't like being wrong

740
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,760
but the reality is is that that socially

741
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,520
constructed belief of someone with pink

742
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,799
hair as a criminal

743
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,440
has now been questioned so now let's go

744
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,360
back to our example

745
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,799
so that makes the sense of signals

746
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,159
improved frontal cortex saying warning

747
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,360
more stranger danger

748
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,960
person will take care you have your

749
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,039
three actions which is across the street

750
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,919
clutch your bag going to a local store

751
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:28,720
but this other

752
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,480
new one pops up which is hey friend

753
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,480
hey remember you watch that video on

754
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,880
youtube and that story of the person

755
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,760
with the pink hair

756
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,240
and how it hurts that person every time

757
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,679
they see them do those things that

758
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,000
you're thinking about doing

759
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,159
maybe you shouldn't act this time maybe

760
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,440
you should just trust the stranger

761
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,960
and you take that one as going forward

762
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,640
because let's be real we don't want to

763
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,200
be terrible people sometimes

764
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,720
and so you send a signal back to your

765
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,360
amygdala saying simmer down we are not

766
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,880
going to act on this this person is not

767
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,440
right

768
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,039
the only thing that's different between

769
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,400
me and that person is just that they

770
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,200
have pink hair

771
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,120
this is ridiculous i don't believe into

772
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,200
this socially constructed belief anymore

773
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,640
boom and that's the thing i want you to

774
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,080
understand

775
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,880
is that right now we all have the

776
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,679
ability

777
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,000
to question our socially constructed

778
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,120
beliefs

779
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,880
and these socially constructed beliefs

780
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,960
does hurt other people

781
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,080
and that's why it's important that we do

782
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,039
every single day is question our beliefs

783
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,880
get outside of our comfort bubble to

784
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,000
understand the other

785
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,720
party because the reality is that we're

786
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,960
not intermingling with each other enough

787
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,279
we kind of stay within our bubble and it

788
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,480
does make us feel

789
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,640
safe and secure and makes us feel like

790
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,240
okay i'm not wrong

791
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,640
so i feel comfortable in my own skin but

792
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,600
the reality is

793
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,760
is that the more you know about the

794
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,200
world that you live in

795
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,960
the more you don't know about the world

796
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,640
you live in and so

797
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,320
and that's what we're dealing with right

798
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,559
now is that people

799
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,799
don't know about hackers they've never

800
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,039
met them they've never had

801
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,279
heard their story so how are they going

802
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,559
to question

803
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,960
the beliefs that they have of the hacker

804
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,919
community

805
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,640
because once we figure out how to change

806
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,679
people's perception

807
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,880
of us that's when we start winning here

808
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,799
that's when we start getting to push for

809
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,320
legislation changes

810
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,760
it's when we start getting companies

811
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,679
have disclosure policies

812
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,600
because right now where we're standing

813
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,200
right now is that

814
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,360
this has resulted in some serious

815
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,640
situations here

816
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,399
that 94 percent of the forbes global

817
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,000
2000 list still doesn't have a

818
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,600
vulnerability disclosure policy

819
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,039
can you believe that it's kind of

820
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,200
ridiculous so think of all the

821
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,320
the hackers out there that are

822
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,399
disclosing vulnerabilities and they're

823
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,559
either being ignored and then later it

824
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,320
becomes breaches for you

825
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,720
and your personal data getting out there

826
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,480
this is the thing we need to be serious

827
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,120
about

828
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,960
and have companies understand is that if

829
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,240
you don't have vulnerability disclosure

830
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,039
policies

831
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,559
you're gonna basically you're opening

832
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,159
the door for the attacker to do whatever

833
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,200
they want

834
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,440
because the hacker who saw it earlier is

835
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,120
scared to report it to you

836
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,600
or you threatened that person because

837
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,200
they are trying to do the good thing

838
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,399
here

839
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,159
and that 60 percent of hackers don't

840
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,840
report those vulnerabilities

841
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,039
because they're afraid of being

842
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,960
prosecuted because the public's

843
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
idea of who we are has been

844
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,120
life-threatening for many of us

845
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,000
not just that the laws right now are so

846
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,039
out of date

847
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,880
and it prevents good hacking the same

848
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,960
way that it prevents bad hacking

849
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,960
because they didn't know the difference

850
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,039
because they don't know these things

851
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,640
especially back then they really didn't

852
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,480
know those things also

853
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,240
the prosecuting ethical hackers is a

854
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,000
real situation that we're still dealing

855
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,159
with to this very day

856
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,799
and not just that because how the public

857
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,240
views us

858
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,039
it doesn't also make us want to always

859
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:51,760
be the

860
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,159
that person who's like well i will do

861
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,159
everything legally correct

862
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,799
and i because the thing is at the end of

863
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,200
the day

864
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,279
is that you see this with kids if you

865
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,480
tell a kid that

866
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,760
they're terrible that they're stupid

867
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,960
or that they basically are bullies they

868
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,240
do act it out

869
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,240
because everyone believes that they are

870
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,840
so they just basically like fine

871
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,640
then i am i will be that type and this

872
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,559
is one of the reasons why we have

873
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,480
a good number of bad actors still

874
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,320
because if we change the legislation how

875
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,520
it is today

876
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,200
i'm pretty sure we'll get a good number

877
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
of attackers switching over

878
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,039
because the reality is if i didn't have

879
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,880
to be worrying about being prosecuted

880
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,760
all the time

881
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,799
and get paid for the stuff that i do you

882
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:35,279
are

883
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,200
sure right that i would definitely want

884
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,279
to make sure i'm on that side

885
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,760
now of course there are folks out there

886
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,200
in this world that don't feel

887
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,799
guilt so those ones we don't re

888
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,640
you know they they could stay as

889
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,080
attackers but the reality is we want the

890
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,440
ones that feel guilty

891
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,039
about what they do to bring them over

892
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,640
now i want to talk about worldwide

893
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,399
legislation here because the thing is is

894
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,159
that you need to know about this few

895
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,799
things so worldwide legislation you'd

896
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,399
find that there's anti-hacking laws

897
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,399
anti-circumvention laws and acceptable

898
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,600
use policy

899
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,440
now the thing to note about here is that

900
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,200
yes this looks very us-centric

901
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,960
but there's a reason why it's because

902
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,240
the u.s set it

903
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,279
up in a way that they started tackling

904
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,880
the anti-hacking

905
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,000
sphere and so other countries followed

906
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,360
and that's what happens when you're kind

907
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,279
of like a superpower i guess people

908
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,559
will follow you in your direction so the

909
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,320
thing is is the anti-hacking laws so the

910
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,000
computer fraud abuse act

911
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,679
um we'll dive into that in the next

912
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,360
slide but the thing is to know is that

913
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,679
it was enacted in 1984.

914
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,159
what came about was this was that ronald

915
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,760
reagan he watched this movie called war

916
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,520
games which we've all seen and

917
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,000
maybe of us some of us love it but that

918
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,360
movie made him

919
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,880
scared out of his mind to a point where

920
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,520
he was like

921
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,559
we gotta do something about these

922
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,960
hackers they're evil people i gotta do

923
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,000
something about this

924
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,919
and that's how the cfa was created was

925
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,159
because he watched war games

926
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,679
remember those socially constructed

927
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,000
beliefs

928
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,440
a movie can also do that too so

929
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,519
the cma was created and basically what

930
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,720
it does is that

931
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,480
if you basically um access a computer

932
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,480
without authorization or ex

933
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,120
you know an excess of authorization

934
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,200
basically this could be used against you

935
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,360
and usually it happens anytime a

936
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,360
researcher goes out of scope and the

937
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,120
company wants to prosecute you

938
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,200
this is used to prosecute hacking the

939
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,320
cfaa

940
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,960
we haven't really seen it in the dmca at

941
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,360
all

942
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,960
and to my knowledge i don't know of any

943
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,279
cases that have but it does produce a

944
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,039
chilling effect and anti-circumvention

945
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,600
laws are copyright laws basically

946
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,159
basically uh seeing reverse engineering

947
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,919
as a

948
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,559
breach of property so that's why you

949
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,240
have to still be a little bit careful be

950
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,320
aware of it and then you have your

951
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,080
acceptable use policy which

952
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,480
some of us know about which is basically

953
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,519
think about this

954
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,880
how many of you guys ever actually read

955
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,720
your terms and conditions say for an

956
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,760
apple product

957
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,600
i did it once um it was 50 pages long

958
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,120
and it definitely was written for an

959
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,960
attorney to another attorney to

960
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,000
understand it

961
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,480
which is the problem here because the

962
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,679
reality is

963
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,120
is that hackers aren't attorneys

964
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,600
and usually but the other thing is to

965
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,880
note is that

966
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,919
not only are hackers not attorneys but

967
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,480
some of us are english learners too

968
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,360
so yeah we got that going on for us so

969
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,039
the thing is is that miscommunication

970
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:35,679
can happen

971
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,640
all the time and acceptable use policy

972
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,279
could be

973
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,720
way better if they broke it down into

974
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,919
being more exact and less verbage

975
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,840
so then the everyday person around the

976
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,919
world could be able to understand it

977
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,080
so then they stay within scope and there

978
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,559
is no miscommunication but the thing you

979
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,760
need to know is that

980
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,480
all those laws that you just saw right

981
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,120
before

982
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,799
this slide were are completely out of

983
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,360
date

984
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,080
all right this was before y2k we're in

985
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,600
2020

986
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,399
and yes i do realize we're still in 2020

987
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,200
this is one

988
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,919
hell of a year but the thing is to note

989
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:16,960
is that

990
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,519
that it's 2020 and that was in 84

991
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,799
the cfa so it doesn't it doesn't seem

992
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,360
right that there has been no reform of

993
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,320
this

994
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,919
not just that the thing you need to know

995
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,320
is that there was no representation at

996
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,840
all of the hacker community

997
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,960
one that was being created and that is

998
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,640
something you need to know

999
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,159
is that when we don't have proper

1000
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,519
representation on any legislation

1001
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,559
we have a problem because those parties

1002
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,039
that are

1003
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,360
impacted by that legislation that wasn't

1004
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,080
taken into consideration or their

1005
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,240
their sharing of how this was going to

1006
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,159
impact their lives

1007
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,399
you've made a terrible legislation

1008
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,240
decision

1009
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,159
because the best legislation out there

1010
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,600
is when they take all the different

1011
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,960
parties and make sure they're in the

1012
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,760
same room

1013
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,679
to talk about what is needed at this

1014
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,320
time that could help everyone at that

1015
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,760
table

1016
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,239
and that's the thing we didn't have and

1017
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,320
unfortunately i hate to be the breaker

1018
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,599
of like

1019
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,879
more bad news in this whole talk but a

1020
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,399
lot of legislators don't know anything

1021
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,000
about cyber security

1022
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,280
they don't even know a difference

1023
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,520
between a hacker or attacker

1024
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,520
but the scary thing is a lot of them

1025
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,719
don't know about

1026
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,480
cyber security and because they don't

1027
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,480
that puts us in a very bad situation

1028
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,599
because laws are now being created or

1029
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,280
have been created

1030
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,599
that basically prevents good things from

1031
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,440
happening

1032
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,040
because they're trying to fix a bad

1033
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,199
situation from occurring

1034
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,199
so the laws right now they prevent good

1035
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,800
hacking in the same way they prevent

1036
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,520
attackers

1037
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,040
and we need really good hacking

1038
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,200
so i want to dive into the cfa and i do

1039
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,400
have plenty of notes so

1040
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,240
you'll see my eyes going a little bit

1041
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,680
more south here

1042
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,400
but the reality is is that the cfa is

1043
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,079
one of those things that needs a real

1044
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:10,880
reform

1045
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,119
at this time because the computer fraud

1046
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,079
abuse act was basically passed in 1984

1047
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,960
and is very out of date at this time but

1048
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,760
it also

1049
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,599
offers prosecutors discretion to

1050
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,440
threaten huge potential fines

1051
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,839
and jail sentences for relatively

1052
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,839
underserving violations of the computer

1053
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,440
policy

1054
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,800
first the cfa azran punishes exceeding

1055
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,200
authorized access to a protected

1056
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,079
computer

1057
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,560
a phrase very vague enough to inspire

1058
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,880
some broad interpretations

1059
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,800
another flaw in the cfa is the redundant

1060
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,079
provisions that

1061
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,160
enable a person to be punished multiple

1062
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,160
times for the exact

1063
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,200
same crime these charges can be stacked

1064
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,320
on top of one

1065
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,359
another resulting in much

1066
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,960
higher jail time but also fines

1067
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,160
for the exact same violation and we saw

1068
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,680
this with aaron schwartz case which

1069
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,680
we'll dive into next

1070
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,359
this also allows prosecutors to bully

1071
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,800
defense into accepting

1072
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,640
a deal in order to avoid facing

1073
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,160
multitude of charges from a single

1074
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,320
solitary act

1075
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,160
it also plays a significant role in

1076
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,000
sentencing the ambiguity

1077
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,240
of a provision meant to toughen

1078
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,760
sentencing for repeat offenders of the

1079
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,800
cfa

1080
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,040
may in fact make it possible for defense

1081
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,000
to be sentenced based

1082
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,480
on what should be prior convictions but

1083
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,760
we're nothing more than multiple

1084
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,280
convictions for the exact same crime

1085
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,520
once again i want you to understand as

1086
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,800
the cfa

1087
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,320
is it gives the right to sue for

1088
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,200
basic companies gives the right to sue

1089
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,720
the hacker community

1090
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,040
um but also is to note that you have

1091
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,280
more to fear from companies

1092
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,720
than states and and also st

1093
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,240
your federal justices so but just note

1094
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,599
that states are still a problem

1095
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,760
but companies are your number one fear

1096
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,400
and i want to talk about aaron swartz

1097
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,160
because aaron swartz

1098
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,200
is an example of how much the cfa is

1099
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,040
needed a reform

1100
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,119
so if you don't know about his story

1101
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,560
this is

1102
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,720
a very sad one so in 2011 carmen

1103
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,320
ortez which was the u.s attorney's

1104
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,079
office charged wards

1105
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,560
for hacking into the mit computer

1106
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,960
network to download millions of jstor

1107
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,800
articles the thing you need to know is

1108
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,520
that this was an

1109
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,240
act of civil disobedience meant to

1110
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,400
basically protest the restricted access

1111
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,359
to

1112
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,640
research funded by taxpayers but i don't

1113
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,280
think he knew

1114
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,119
what could have happened in the end

1115
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,480
because of it

1116
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,320
so the u.s attorney brought charges that

1117
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,200
carried a maximum penalty of 35 years in

1118
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,480
prison

1119
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,200
i want you to understand something he

1120
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,920
was facing

1121
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,119
35 years in prison for one act

1122
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,560
one thing you need to know is that a

1123
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,960
first degree murder in this country

1124
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,480
is a minimum of 25 years

1125
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,839
atmosphere was not hurting anyone

1126
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,800
but yet he was looking at 35 years in

1127
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,320
prison

1128
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,920
not just that but one million dollars in

1129
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,000
fines and they were able

1130
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,160
to do that because the way that the cfa

1131
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,520
is written that they get stacked

1132
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,040
on top of stacking um and that is the

1133
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,160
problem here

1134
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,760
because what happened was that it was a

1135
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,079
17-month

1136
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,240
legal battle that he was dealing with

1137
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,920
and there was no set trial

1138
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,960
date at all

1139
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,720
and so through source perspective it

1140
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,520
must have been so overwhelming

1141
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,599
imagine that your life right at that

1142
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,520
moment you have no control of it

1143
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,640
and you're being used to set an example

1144
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,160
but they don't understand is that when

1145
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,160
you use someone by an example you are

1146
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,480
damaging that person for the rest of

1147
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,520
their life

1148
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,720
not just that but the people around them

1149
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,119
so every time someone is using a hacker

1150
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:03,839
for

1151
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,440
busy to demonstrate this is what will

1152
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,560
happen to you if you do this

1153
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,400
i i cannot say this even stronger than

1154
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,599
anything ever

1155
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,640
is that you're being a horrible person

1156
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,320
because you do not know what that's

1157
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,240
going to be for other people

1158
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,800
using people as an example to show how

1159
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,280
bad

1160
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,359
this can be for you if you do these

1161
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,200
things

1162
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,280
that's there's no heart in that

1163
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,079
and that's the problem here because the

1164
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,640
unfortunate bit because of the situation

1165
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,160
using him as an example to set the scene

1166
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,200
it cost him his life he hung himself

1167
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,520
in his apartment on january 11

1168
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:51,680
2013. of course i dropped the charges

1169
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,920
but you can't how do you go to a family

1170
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,560
and be like we dropped the charges

1171
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,320
his family pretty sure stated that

1172
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,200
it was because of this situation that he

1173
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,560
decided to take his own life

1174
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,760
how do you go to a family and basically

1175
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,560
be like i dropped the charges or sorry

1176
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,880
about your loss

1177
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,040
when in reality they were the reason for

1178
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,079
it they pushed him

1179
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,880
way over the end he had no future at

1180
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,880
that moment in his life

1181
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,040
so he took his own control the only

1182
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,040
control that he had left at that very

1183
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,560
moment

1184
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,680
and he took his own life

1185
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,800
it's his story that still motivates many

1186
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,000
of us to keep fighting

1187
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,880
for rights it's his story that pushes

1188
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,440
for reform to occur

1189
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,000
and this is his story that basically

1190
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,640
wanted to change the situation

1191
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,079
so aaron's law which was created in 2013

1192
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,119
was a response to this

1193
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,680
but it didn't pass unfortunately because

1194
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,880
there were some major

1195
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,880
tech companies with some really big

1196
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,960
pockets that were lobbing heavily to

1197
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,640
make sure it didn't pass

1198
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,240
but the thing is to note is that it

1199
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,560
would have changed the phrasing

1200
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,119
of it so instead of just saying like

1201
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,319
exceeds authorized

1202
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,960
access to access without authorization

1203
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,839
just keep it

1204
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,760
very simple that permission was granted

1205
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,119
or that it wasn't exploited the other

1206
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,960
thing is that allowing those stacks to

1207
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,319
stop doing it

1208
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,359
where if they did one crime they only

1209
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,240
are charged with one crime not multiple

1210
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,520
crimes

1211
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,560
for that one act

1212
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,079
because that's what was going on with

1213
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,079
him and we see that

1214
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,960
all across the world when hackers are

1215
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,800
being prosecuted is that these things

1216
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,000
are being stacked against

1217
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
them and they spend a long time in

1218
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,839
prison or a huge

1219
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,079
amount of money as well to pay for the

1220
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,359
penalties

1221
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,359
and this seems really terrible

1222
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,400
now besides the cfa you need to know

1223
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,599
about the dmca

1224
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,079
even though i don't know of any cases of

1225
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,000
any hacker being prosecuted used

1226
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,599
with this but the thing is to note is

1227
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,359
that the dmca basically

1228
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,440
puts in that reverse engineering is seen

1229
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,040
as a breach of companies and this gives

1230
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,560
the rights for companies to come

1231
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,280
after you if you basically do something

1232
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,160
to their product that

1233
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,079
it wasn't designed to do or something

1234
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,560
they don't like you to do

1235
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,240
it does create a chilling effect so it's

1236
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,439
important to note about them

1237
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,640
now with improvements of legislation we

1238
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,520
can change

1239
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,560
where we stand today imagine every

1240
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,440
single company

1241
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,480
around the u.s had disclosure policies

1242
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,119
like it was

1243
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,480
embedded that if you are practicing

1244
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,119
any business that your compliance

1245
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:47,760
checklist

1246
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,359
had to include a vulnerability

1247
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,280
disclosure policy

1248
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,599
wouldn't that be amazing that bilateral

1249
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,599
trust amongst organizations and hackers

1250
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,599
could finally close that gap

1251
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,520
and we could work so much stronger than

1252
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,640
ever before

1253
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,240
that we could prevent attackers from

1254
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,920
doing so much damage that they do right

1255
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,000
now

1256
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,319
but also not just that it would

1257
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,079
encourage more good hacking in this

1258
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,400
country and we need that because

1259
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,200
i tell you there are people out there

1260
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:15,680
that

1261
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,319
do want to do practice better hacking

1262
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,839
and whatnot but the problem is

1263
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,200
is that they're only seen exactly the

1264
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,720
same by the public

1265
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,960
and so the shifting over it's not

1266
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,880
logically sound for them to switch over

1267
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,040
but i do want to say once again that

1268
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,160
those are the people that feel

1269
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,319
guilty about what they do the ones that

1270
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,000
you know wake up in the middle of night

1271
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,560
and are freaking out the thing is is

1272
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,240
that there are people out there

1273
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,000
that don't feel guilty about the crimes

1274
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
that they commit they don't feel guilty

1275
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,200
if they steal money they don't feel

1276
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,720
guilty of taking personal data and

1277
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,440
selling it they don't feel guilty at all

1278
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,280
then those i will always frame as

1279
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,560
attackers

1280
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,640
because you gotta have a conscious i

1281
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,839
would say to be a hacker

1282
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,520
but i want to talk more into influence

1283
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,599
in the public cycle because in reality

1284
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:08,160
is is

1285
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,800
we want to get rights for hackers we

1286
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,960
have to work with these three groups

1287
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,880
organizations we need them to have

1288
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,400
disclosure policies

1289
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,720
and to push for disclosure policies but

1290
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,319
also to help

1291
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,319
try to bring in the conversation for

1292
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:26,560
legislation to do some sort of reform

1293
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,040
but also we need the media to join us

1294
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,880
because we cannot change the public's

1295
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,560
perception of who we are unless the

1296
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,200
media starts reporting correctly

1297
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,000
reporting you know the right terms

1298
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,880
hacker

1299
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,599
or attacker which one is it you gotta be

1300
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,240
very

1301
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,680
specific also changing the imagery

1302
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,720
not all of us wear hoodies 24 7. i love

1303
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,520
a hoodie

1304
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,839
but i don't walk outside with a hoodie

1305
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,520
the thing is is that's the whole thing

1306
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,200
is that the public has a weird

1307
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,800
perception of who we are they think they

1308
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,400
know us but they really don't because

1309
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,240
they've never heard our story

1310
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,920
and so that's why it's important is that

1311
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,359
we have to work with the media

1312
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,319
organizations and legislation to change

1313
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,280
where we stand

1314
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,160
at this point

1315
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,160
but the good news is that we can do that

1316
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,839
and here are some simple things the

1317
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:16,960
first thing we need to change the

1318
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,319
language and imagery

1319
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,440
of what's being reported in infosec we

1320
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,880
need to work with the media

1321
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,960
remember the media is our friend they

1322
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,640
don't know the difference

1323
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,599
so we have to tell them the difference

1324
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:30,000
but

1325
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,440
kindly i want to just reiterate that

1326
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,520
be kind you do not know where they come

1327
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,440
from or you've never been in their shoes

1328
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,160
before

1329
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,800
they don't know better so we have to be

1330
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,800
kind when we correct them

1331
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,240
we also need a society to know as the

1332
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,240
everyday heroes we need people to hear

1333
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,520
our stories

1334
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,200
if they saw our images like those

1335
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,119
youtube videos like in that example with

1336
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,040
the person with pink hair

1337
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,280
think of how many people we can change

1338
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,599
of their perceptions of who we are

1339
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,040
we can challenge their socially

1340
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,119
constructive beliefs granted we can't

1341
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:01,599
change

1342
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,160
everyone because like i said if you were

1343
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:04,960
someone who's

1344
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,960
insecure about yourself or you don't

1345
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,160
like being wrong

1346
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,920
you're gonna have a hard time doing that

1347
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,200
but at least

1348
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,880
then you could get the people around

1349
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,960
that person to start pushing

1350
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,000
that person in the right direction

1351
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,640
see social engineering also we need

1352
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,760
organizations to have vulnerability

1353
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,640
solution policies

1354
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,160
i'm sorry at the end of the day every

1355
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,240
organization should have one

1356
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,160
it's important because then we avoid

1357
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,079
situations from occurring which hurts

1358
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,440
both parties

1359
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,520
um we also need our representatives to

1360
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,200
update today's legislation the thing is

1361
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,640
like i said they don't know too much

1362
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,079
about cyber security and because they

1363
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,440
don't we're still running into the

1364
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,119
situation

1365
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,720
but the first step that you can take

1366
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,480
right at this moment is go to that

1367
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,560
website and sign that petition

1368
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,400
this petition basically is everything

1369
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,319
that i talked about and how all of us

1370
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,839
need to understand that

1371
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,560
we need to change something so go ahead

1372
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,000
and sign it share it with your friends

1373
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,599
and family you don't have to be a hacker

1374
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:58,560
to sign this

1375
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,880
it's anyone out there who believes that

1376
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,680
we should have

1377
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,880
rights that is for you now the thing to

1378
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,480
know is that when this petition kicked

1379
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,680
off at the end of february

1380
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,640
i wanted to take action and because i

1381
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,319
was like okay i don't want to just do

1382
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,400
the talk i want to take action

1383
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,560
and so i need to find someone a partner

1384
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,319
in crime to help me on this

1385
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,960
front so um i came across hacking is not

1386
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,240
a crime

1387
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,960
which was basically um this guy named

1388
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,440
brian

1389
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,800
and he created a bunch of stickers

1390
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,559
hacking is not a crime based around the

1391
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,400
skateboarding

1392
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,119
uh image and so i would see these at

1393
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:36,079
conferences

1394
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,440
so i reached out to them saying hey um

1395
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,720
do you want to partner on something

1396
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,240
because i created this petition and i

1397
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,079
think you and i are aligned on this

1398
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,839
i didn't know it was brian at the time i

1399
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,280
didn't know it was just brian doing

1400
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,599
everything at the time

1401
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,280
so we got on the call and we started

1402
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:51,880
talking and

1403
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:52,960
[Music]

1404
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,520
we decided let's partner up and let's

1405
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,280
bring actions here now

1406
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,200
so hacking is that crime was born

1407
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,160
recently and so hacking is thatcrime.org

1408
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,440
you can visit the website

1409
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,119
what we're trying to do is change the

1410
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,640
public perception of the hacker

1411
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,839
community

1412
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,960
but not just that but also to change our

1413
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,240
current legislation

1414
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,480
by working with organizations and

1415
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,079
politicians to bring about a change

1416
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,359
the other thing you should know is that

1417
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,000
we just did uh we just launched a

1418
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,640
project that you can participate called

1419
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,400
hacker stories

1420
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,160
um and you can see this on twitter on

1421
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,480
our handle which is hack not crime

1422
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,559
um and in it it's basically people

1423
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,000
starting to do their own youtube

1424
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
videos basically two to eight minutes

1425
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,680
i'm talking to the camera

1426
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,040
i'm telling what it's like to be a

1427
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,119
hacker the good and the bad

1428
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,480
with it and why we need a change and

1429
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,920
those are the stories that we need to

1430
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,839
get out there in public not just that

1431
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:49,520
we've also been contacting

1432
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,760
various large media outlets to correct

1433
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,760
them on their terminology and their

1434
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,480
imagery

1435
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,319
and we've had some great conversations

1436
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,000
so far

1437
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,200
and next step is talking with

1438
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,640
legislators so you can get part of it by

1439
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,839
the way we're always looking for

1440
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,599
volunteers and advocates so if you are

1441
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:06,240
interested

1442
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,040
you know reach out um the second step to

1443
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,000
note is that

1444
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,119
anytime you see the press reporting um

1445
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,640
hacker instead of the term attacker um

1446
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,640
let them know remember be kind and doing

1447
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,319
it and we see this happening a lot on

1448
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:21,119
twitter

1449
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,079
so if a news outlet basically has a

1450
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,359
story about a

1451
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:28,000
um an attacker doing something terrible

1452
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,760
a hacker in the community does respond

1453
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,839
and retweets it out and also

1454
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,160
cr like dms i'm letting them know hey

1455
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,680
you got it wrong this is the correct

1456
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,640
term

1457
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,520
um these terminology is important for

1458
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,119
you understand because it's hurting us

1459
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,680
in the community because it's it's

1460
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,920
preventing us from getting rights

1461
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,319
so that's one thing you could do also if

1462
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,800
you're someone who talks to the press

1463
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,960
always let the reporter know the

1464
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,720
difference between a hacker and an

1465
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,400
attacker so when they're writing and

1466
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,920
drafting the story they have a better

1467
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,040
idea of

1468
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,280
how to actually write it in a way that

1469
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,040
is a lot more reflective

1470
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,079
of also the hacker community

1471
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:07,920
the third step that you can do is make

1472
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,200
sure that every

1473
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,200
company that you work at or organization

1474
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,720
you partnered up with have

1475
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,599
a vulnerability disclosure policy set

1476
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:16,960
because vulnerability disclosure

1477
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,760
policies

1478
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,520
basically opens the door for

1479
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,440
communications between hackers and

1480
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,640
organizations

1481
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,559
to be more secure because with that

1482
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,720
vulnerability disclosure policies

1483
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,240
the thing you need to know is you

1484
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,319
already know all the other stuff

1485
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,000
but something you should note is that

1486
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
not every secure team is going to catch

1487
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
every vulnerability

1488
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,559
and that's the reality of it you're not

1489
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:39,760
always going to catch things so

1490
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,079
sometimes you have to rely on

1491
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,880
the outside world to help and it's

1492
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,319
always good to do that because

1493
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:47,839
when you rather find out about your

1494
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,440
disclosure from a hacker someone who's

1495
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,640
trying to do it in good faith

1496
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,119
versus an attacker who doesn't tell you

1497
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,040
at all and then utilizes for their own

1498
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,079
gain

1499
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:57,200
that's why you need vulnerability

1500
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,359
disclosure policies it's a lot better

1501
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:02,319
communicative form of uh making sure you

1502
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:03,920
have that door open for

1503
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,240
hackers to report something and if

1504
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,200
you're an

1505
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,680
it's like well we can't do that because

1506
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,920
if we do that then we get more attention

1507
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,240
to ourselves and they're going to do a

1508
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,359
lot of things and we're

1509
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,480
we don't want to deal with that i hate

1510
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,520
to tell you

1511
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,400
this but that is a false claim the

1512
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,440
reality is that

1513
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,440
any time zone goes to your website

1514
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,040
they're looking for vulnerabilities

1515
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,480
whether or not you are

1516
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,960
stating that you allow disclosure

1517
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,800
they're already looking for it

1518
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,480
so it's better in your interest to just

1519
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,400
do it at this point

1520
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,640
also if you are working at an

1521
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,079
organization that wants to push for

1522
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,119
hacker rights

1523
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,640
connect with us because we are working

1524
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,480
with other companies because we need to

1525
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,319
work with companies to change

1526
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:48,800
legislation believe it or not and also

1527
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,160
to change people's perception

1528
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,800
of the hacker community the fourth step

1529
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,960
that you can do at this time is contact

1530
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,119
your local representatives

1531
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,040
know who your local representatives are

1532
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,480
because it's so important

1533
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,160
is that we have to let them know they

1534
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,680
need to update their current legislation

1535
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,000
because

1536
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,760
it's hurting you not just you your

1537
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,280
family your friends too

1538
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,119
because if anything happens to you who

1539
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,240
is that going to impact

1540
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,960
exactly so it's important that we stop

1541
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,280
are

1542
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,200
talking about it and you could set up a

1543
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,800
call basically with them

1544
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,119
but the remember that the angle isn't

1545
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,480
telling them

1546
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,040
how to do their job the goal is to find

1547
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:25,920
out what

1548
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,920
is the thing that they're they've been

1549
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,280
wanting to fix

1550
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,280
and how can the hacker community help

1551
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,040
them with that so you want to find a

1552
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,640
common ground of pain

1553
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,680
to help each other out don't go at this

1554
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,960
alone

1555
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,800
if you have set up an appointment with

1556
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,400
your legislator

1557
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,240
contact me or hack not crime on twitter

1558
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,200
dm us or

1559
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,480
email us from hackinessnotacrime.org

website you can put it in you can send a

1561
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,880
contact

and we will join you on that call so

1563
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,599
you're not by yourself don't go by

1564
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:58,319
yourself on

1565
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,480
anything in reality whenever you have to

1566
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,079
change something you need to have more

1567
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,760
presence in the room

1568
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,040
or the virtual room um also keep a note

1569
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,960
of the van buren case because the van

1570
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,040
buren case is going to be revisited not

1571
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,400
revisit it's going to be visited on

1572
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,680
november 30th

1573
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,839
at this time of course that might change

1574
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,000
because of the election that's going on

1575
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,359
but the thing you need to know is that

1576
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,040
this is the first time in a long time

1577
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:21,680
the cfa

1578
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,480
is going to be revisited but the thing

1579
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,400
to note about it is that

1580
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,680
under this um expansive interpretation

1581
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,599
of the cfa for this case

1582
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,319
it become a federal crime any time a

1583
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,079
person violates a website's term or

1584
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,359
services

1585
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,680
it finally in terms of services is a

1586
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,520
crime you need to understand this this

1587
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,599
is the most important part right now

1588
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,000
private companies then get to decide who

1589
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,119
goes to prison

1590
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,520
and for what which then puts us at a

1591
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,800
huge risk for everyday online behavior

1592
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,400
so it's really important is that we keep

1593
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,000
an eye on it and if you want to get

1594
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,599
involved to make sure

1595
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,400
um you know we have a voice in the

1596
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,000
hacker community when this is happening

1597
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,240
i'll reach out

1598
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,000
the fifth step that you can do is always

1599
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,720
volunteer your time or resources

1600
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,040
to support i'm the calvary disclose dot

1601
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:11,920
io

1602
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,920
uh cert coordination center also known

1603
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,480
as cert cc eff and cti league these are

1604
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,160
great organizations that are trying to

1605
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,079
change the situation that we're in

1606
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:23,920
or to provide some sort of rights or

1607
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,200
advocacy for you

1608
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,119
so the main takeaways from all this is

1609
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,119
that hackers deserve

1610
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,880
protection and rights period

1611
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,520
it should not have taken this long to

1612
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,000
even

1613
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,640
have this type of conversation that

1614
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,880
should have happened a long time ago

1615
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,880
and it has been but the thing is we

1616
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,960
haven't been able to move more forward

1617
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,040
but now is the time for us to move

1618
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,559
forward

1619
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,960
we need to update our current language

1620
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,079
and also

1621
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,480
our imagery that's being used by working

1622
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,440
with the media

1623
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,319
we also need to work together to change

1624
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:01,440
public perception

1625
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,559
because we got to influence

1626
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:04,640
organizations legislators

1627
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,960
and the media so working together is a

1628
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,240
beautiful thing

1629
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,319
and that's why hack is not crime.org is

1630
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,079
exists because it's a grass-rooted

1631
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:12,960
efforts to

1632
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,240
change the situation um but

1633
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,920
of course with as much empathy as

1634
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,599
possible too

1635
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,040
feel free to sign and share that

petition push for change share this talk

1637
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,559
these are all things that you can do

1638
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:25,040
right now

1639
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,160
also go to hack.crime

1640
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,640
on twitter if you want to follow find

1641
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,400
out what we're doing our latest things

1642
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,680
also get involved we're looking for

1643
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,599
volunteers and advocates

1644
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,079
but i just want to first remind you once

1645
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,280
again over and over

1646
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,760
because it's so important is that change

1647
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,599
starts with you and me

1648
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,240
and we cannot give up on this fight

1649
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,119
because

1650
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,359
i never ever ever want to read another

1651
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,520
story that's similar to aaron swartz and

1652
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,079
i'm sure

1653
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,960
you don't either i think it's about time

1654
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,799
that we start

1655
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:59,200
being a lot more protective of the

1656
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,960
people in our community

1657
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,119
but also being part of the community to

1658
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,480
work together

1659
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,760
to bring about a change

1660
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:09,760

seriously that was a great uh great talk

1676
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,839
chloe uh and very timely

1677
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,480
um you know i was on the board advisory

1678
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,359
board for

1679
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,520
hackers for charity for a long time and

1680
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,720
um

1681
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,079
you know one of the things that johnny

1682
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,880
long uh and us always struggled with was

1683
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,760
how do you take the name hacker back

1684
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,760
and john had spoken about that many

1685
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,000
times uh you know and there's no more

1686
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,280
compelling story about hacking than his

1687
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,440
story of how he started his mission at

1688
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,960
uganda

1689
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,319
uh you know and how he used uh hacking

1690
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,160
to support that charity

1691
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,280
uh over there and you know so many times

1692
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,160
i would wear a

1693
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,240
ihack charities t-shirt into a

1694
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,079
restaurant and you know the

1695
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,359
conversations that those would start was

1696
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:29,839
always

1697
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:32,960
uh interesting and engaging but uh you

1698
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:33,280
know

1699
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,960
i know i personally loved your talk i

1700
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,920
think it's very timely and

1701
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,240
very necessary for the community thank

1702
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,319
you and you did make a valid point it's

1703
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:43,680
very hard to take back

1704
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,760
a name that you want to use or a label

1705
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,599
but we've seen it happen

1706
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,720
throughout history for myself um

1707
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,760
for example my family is iranian but the

1708
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,000
thing

1709
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,240
is that we don't support the regime at

1710
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,359
all we

1711
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,920
left before the revolution and during

1712
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,960
the revolution

1713
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,720
because we don't want to have anything

1714
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,480
to do with that government so we use the

1715
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:04,880
term

1716
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,680
persian so you may hear this is that

1717
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,440
iran's will use the term persian

1718
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,760
instead of iranian to reinstate that

1719
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,760
they supported the

1720
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,599
um they don't support the regime at all

1721
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,119
and what has happened

1722
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,720
so it's it's always important to note is

1723
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,040
that you can always reclaim a title

1724
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,599
a name or whatnot it just it's simply

1725
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:27,599
just taken the first step forward

1726
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,720
well we really appreciate your talk and

1727
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,160

1728
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,319
