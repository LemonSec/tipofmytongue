1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,000
okay so my name is brandon storytime

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,120
and the reason why i'm

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,040
doing this talk is because uh

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,559
a lot of times at conferences you only

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,920
hear about the you know the successes

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,039
the things that went

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,960
right um so for a while now

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,039
i've been teaching at marshall

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,160
university

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,960
and my students come up to me and and

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,599
they feel

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,079
you know sometimes like uh they're just

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,840
not doing as good as they can

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,760
and so i always have to explain to them

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,280
you know especially whenever

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,600
you're at conferences you're really kind

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,360
of watching a polished view

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,760
right you're watching that couple of

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,360
hours worth of

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,559
of polish in the hundreds of hours worth

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,840
of failure

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,960
so uh a few years ago in

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,320
uh hackercon i did a

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,879
non-technical presentation on prepping

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,199
and so now whenever i get the chance i

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,800
try to do some non-technical

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,080
presentations

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,680
and i usually do it uh you know

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,840
highlighting my own failures just

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,240
because

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,000
you know people typically come up to me

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,840
afterwards and they say

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,479
number one uh thanks for being honest

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,680
and number two

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,000
i can't believe you recovered from that

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,520
that was pretty dumb

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,560
uh but congratulations so here i am

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,079
and uh welcome to story time

39
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,479
so me i've already touched on this a

40
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,560
little bit but i'll go into a little

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,400
more in depth so i am a christian i

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,920
always say that up front

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,119
um uh

44
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,200
there are plenty of conversations we can

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,399
have about that i'll just

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,240
leave that there for you i'm also a

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,159
husband and father i've been married

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,200
more than 25 years my oldest daughter

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,840
is 20 and she was at uh moorhead state

50
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,560
but due to co bid she came back home and

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
i can't wait for morehead state to

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,600
to start back up um

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,479
i'm also you know i have three other uh

54
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,040
kids

55
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,080
uh 20 years old 17 14

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,959
and 5. and yes there's a there's a

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,879
significant gap there

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,480
um yeah pushed back my retirement a

59
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,400
little bit but i'm still happy

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,040
um speaking of retirement i've already

61
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,959
retired once which is why i'm still

62
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:25,680
happy

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
so i spent 20 years in the navy as a

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,280
cryptologic technician

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,160
most of that was doing maintenance um

66
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,720
and then

67
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,680
some of that was doing network analysis

68
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,080
in

69
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,519
a intelligence analyst role which is a

70
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,040
pretty cool

71
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,400
um job that i had it gave me the best of

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,760
both worlds i got to still

73
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,800
remain technical but also get a better

74
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,160
understanding of specific

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,200
targets not as technology but as

76
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,440
the people that use them which that was

77
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,200
that was pretty fun

78
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,800
i am a uh project starter

79
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,000
and rarely a project finisher so if i

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,720
was to take you downstairs in my garage

81
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,920
you would see half

82
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,640
you know completed projects everywhere

83
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,360
every surface of my garage

84
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,599
usually the only projects i finish are

85
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,680
some type of hardware hacking on my

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,800
motorcycle

87
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,200
so i'm really into that lately whether

88
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,920
it be

89
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,440
you know adding of components modding or

90
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,560
just building things myself that i would

91
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:30,959
add

92
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,920
to to my motorcycle i'm an adjunct

93
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,760
instructor for marshall university i

94
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,400
have been

95
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,760
for what this is my third semester

96
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,680
i started out teaching just a

97
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,120
intro to open source intelligence course

98
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,000
and then now i teach as well as that a

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,480
intro to linux course

100
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,080
um and then most importantly

101
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,840
i'm a storyteller i learned a long time

102
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,400
ago

103
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,239
you know attending these conferences

104
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,920
that people

105
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,200
remember the stories that you tell

106
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,239
rarely do they remember the details

107
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,319
and whenever i started doing my own

108
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,760
presentations

109
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,560
it seemed like uh everybody was asking

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,839
me for my notes

111
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,040
i was having to manage you know github

112
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,240
and and uh my own blog and things of

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,759
that nature writing up

114
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,479
you know like after a conference i call

115
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,000
them after action reports because i was

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,880
military

117
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,000
um and things of that nature so

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,800
i decided to start switching i slowly

119
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,360
switched

120
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,600
i don't do very many technical

121
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,280
presentations anymore if i do it's

122
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
usually associated with

123
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,170
uh hardware hacking um

124
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,400
[Music]

125
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,919
and more so

126
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,160
lately i've been really focusing on my

127
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,040
kids

128
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,320
so i love secure west virginia and um

129
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,360
hackercon because both my

130
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
uh my my 20 year old daughter who was

131
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,800
then 14

132
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,840
they welcomed her as a presenter and i

133
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,320
really appreciate that and it actually

134
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,759
got to the point where at

135
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,120
15 years old she spoke at schmuten so as

136
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,479
a dad

137
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,880
really hit me in the chest right um so

138
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,120
then i started you know i focus on my my

139
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,000
second daughter

140
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,520
she's now 17. neither one of them

141
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,600
want to follow in my footsteps but both

142
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,520
of them love to tinker and do things

143
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,479
like that

144
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,840
um but anyway and then my my 14 year old

145
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,199
has pretty much told me to leave him

146
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,560
alone so i gotta

147
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,080
figure out how i can get him speaking at

148
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,800
a conference um and once again shout out

149
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,280
to

150
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,759
uh now secure wv uh for letting my

151
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,639
my second child my other daughter speak

152
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,639
so i really appreciate that

153
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,680
i'm always trying to push them and

154
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,199
this con is one of the best environments

155
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,000

156
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600

157
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,800
all right so what are we here for um

158
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,960
once again story time i'm gonna tell you

159
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,800
about my career

160
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,000
uh starting in high school and falling

161
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,400
flat on my first you know facebook

162
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
before my even career started

163
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,360
um and then we're gonna we're gonna go

164
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,400
all the way up to

165
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,160
i think 2017 is where i stopped um

166
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,560
but basically each slide is going to

167
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,600
give you some

168
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,919
some milestones so some significant

169
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:28,960
events

170
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,000
are significant failures in my life how

171
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,240
i

172
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,440
recovered from those lessons learned

173
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,360
and then i'm going to talk about

174
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,520
imposter syndrome because that led to a

175
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,360
lot of my failures

176
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,479
one of two things earlier in my life

177
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,160
it was that i'm very type a and

178
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,240
back then it was it just oozed from me i

179
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,479
mean from every core

180
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,639
and then as i got older a little calmer

181
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,280
then i started with the imposter

182
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,199
syndrome and that that led to some of my

183
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,560
later failures

184
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,479
uh but like i said i always like to talk

185
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,800
about my failures and the hopes that

186
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,199
um you can actually pick something up

187
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,280
and and learn it from me

188
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,880
um and i won't say so that you won't

189
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,680
fail um the purpose of this talk is

190
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,880
actually to help you

191
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,080
understand that failure is necessary

192
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,039
it is a necessity in life and what you

193
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:27,759
need to do

194
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,960
is like i said learn from it um

195
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,199
do it again i mean you know people

196
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,800
always say learn from it the first time

197
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,479
so don't make that mistake over

198
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,520
no because no failure is the same

199
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,880
um the lesson may be the same but what

200
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,560
led up to the failure is completely

201
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,759
different

202
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,800
and so

203
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,960
my first milestone was in 1990

204
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,080
i was uh 17 years old

205
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,160
um oh the 90s if you lived through the

206
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,919
90s in my opinion

207
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,560
it was great so we had people like green

208
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,360
day

209
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,680
right they introduced their own brand of

210
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,560
punk

211
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,280
and then you got to watch them traverse

212
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,080
into the

213
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,840
whole concept of they weren't actually

214
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,520
punk they became popular

215
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,840
so they were pop punk which they hated

216
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,599
and that forced them more to the punk

217
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,479
side but

218
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,599
whatever um we had the triplets

219
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,599
were in their second year they were

220
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,879
actually starting to win

221
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,440
right dallas cowboys go cowboys uh

222
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,080
aikman

223
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,199
emmett smith irvin um they

224
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,559
went seven and nine i think uh in in

225
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,200
1990

226
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,440
and then after that they started winning

227
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,200
and that was that was exciting for me

228
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,039
growing up in texas

229
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,160
but mostly i was a borderline genius

230
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,240
and i mean you know i don't have the

231
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,880
scores to support that

232
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,279
but in my mind i was one of the smartest

233
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,880
people i knew

234
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
i knew just about everything just just

235
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,000
asked me

236
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,120
and um you know typical teenager

237
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,839
at least teenagers in my household uh i

238
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,839
was in the top 10 percent of my class

239
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,519
um you know i was because i was a texas

240
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,720
resident top 10

241
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,800
i was guaranteed to see at any texas

242
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,920
state university

243
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,000
which in my mind of course right because

244
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,440
i'm so brilliant

245
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,680
uh and then um so i applied to texas a m

246
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,279
computer science program or actually at

247
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,880
that time it was computer engineering

248
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,760
program

249
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,360
and um lsu penn state purdue they all

250
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,880
accepted me for their

251
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,680
for their engineering schools and the

252
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,519
problem is

253
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,480
is my parents sat me down my my divorce

254
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,440
parents who were then

255
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,720
living together again weird and they sat

256
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,640
me down and explained just how poor we

257
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,519
were

258
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,760
and the fact that uh neither one of them

259
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,160
had paid taxes for a while and they

260
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,399
would greatly appreciate

261
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,480
if i wouldn't fill out those federal

262
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,839
forms

263
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,920
that that would actually put into

264
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,320
context how much they actually made

265
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,560
and because of that uh

266
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
financial aid just wasn't an option for

267
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,279
me and for someone who had their

268
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,760
their entire life planned out you know

269
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,600
that was kind of a shocker

270
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,959
and so i immediately uh

271
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,600
drove to my uncle's house told me you

272
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,120
were in the military take me to some

273
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,399
recruiters

274
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,680
and um he was a marine and that was the

275
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,519
first branch he talked to me out of was

276
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,040
the marine corps

277
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200
um he talked me into the navy or air

278
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,360
force air force office was closed

279
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,680
so that was my first failure is the

280
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,839
inability to read

281
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,839
the opening hours of the business i was

282
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,120
trying to go to

283
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,320
and uh so i joined the navy my lesson

284
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
from this actually was

285
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,720
control those things that you can

286
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,160
control

287
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,519
make a plan and work the plan

288
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,959
so i had this this dream i was one of

289
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,120
those people that truly believed that

290
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,079
you only have a plan a because you know

291
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,920
if you have a plan b

292
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,920
you're you're inviting failure and

293
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,680
like i said now looking back on that

294
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,240
is absolutely wrong mindset if you go on

295
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,800
the link in

296
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,640
linkedin you'll see this everywhere

297
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,399
never have a plan b

298
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,160
um okay i mean it may work for you in

299
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,800
your one

300
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,839
instance uh plan b worked for me uh

301
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,160
granted it was a plan b on the fly um

302
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,440
so that brings me to my second milestone

303
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,560
so um the we had such

304
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,360
uh great movies as the last detail this

305
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,200
is one of my big influencers early in

306
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,440
life and if you've seen the movie you're

307
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,560
probably thinking

308
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,920
your parents were idiots if this was

309
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,279
what really uh uh set your your mood for

310
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:51,760
life

311
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,160
and looking back yeah that's that's a

312
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,839
valid statement they probably should

313
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,360
have never let me watch that movie

314
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,959
whenever it first came out

315
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,160
uh all right so um

316
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,440
but like we said i just wanted to enlist

317
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,320
so i went to maps i took the nuclear

318
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,200
power school

319
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,760
or the nuclear power engineering test

320
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,720
and as i was being presented the test

321
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,839
the nuke that was actually the uh giving

322
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,800
handing the test out cautioned me about

323
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,160
pursuing that rate

324
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,760
because and his sailor

325
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,040
words basically was it sucked

326
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,000
don't do it um so i signed up to be an

327
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,120
air traffic controller

328
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,160
why no no it was available uh

329
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,279
i'm a part of the top gun generation so

330
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,720
i know i couldn't fly planes because i

331
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,240
was going to be enlisted so hey air

332
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,440
traffic controller

333
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,680
uh the problem was they signed me up to

334
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,480
go to boot camp

335
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,279
in january now if you recall from my

336
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,399
first milestone

337
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,760
i was still in high school and i wasn't

338
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,440
going to graduate until may

339
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,240
so i had to get back on the bus head

340
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,600
back to houston

341
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,720
and pick a different job so my solution

342
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,519
was

343
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,160
they handed me a sheet that had all the

344
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,839
careers on it

345
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,279
and i saw two things number one was

346
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,800
that the school was uh eight months

347
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,760
in pensacola florida which i'd been to

348
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,320
before

349
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,279
and i loved uh the beach there and then

350
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,839
mostly worked in air-conditioned spaces

351
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,279
so whenever i say i fell into security i

352
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,240
literally just by the grace of god was

353
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,760
handed a piece of paper

354
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,440
out of a stack by the way this one just

355
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,200
happened to be on top um

356
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,600
and that's how i picked uh to be a navy

357
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,880
cryptologist

358
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,639
i knew nothing about it um yeah

359
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,880
so my lesson here is sometimes your your

360
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,240
plan just sucks

361
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,360
i have a backup plan um this was my you

362
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,519
know the second time learning this in

363
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,440
just a couple of months and we're

364
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,560
actually going to talk about that later

365
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,040
i'm going to come back to that

366
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,399
so uh i joined as a us navy

367
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,639
cryptologic technician and my focus was

368
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,440
going to be on

369
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,360
maintenance all i knew at that time like

370
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,880
i said pensacola florida

371
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,959
mostly works in air-conditioned spaces

372
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,480
and that i was going to get a security

373
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,279
clearance that's

374
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,279
that's really it that brings us

375
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,399
you know to the middle and yeah the

376
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,160
middle of 1991

377
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,880
all the way up through 1992 because that

378
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,120
was just a long string of failures in my

379
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,920
life

380
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,360
and um once again i survived so

381
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,440
what we had going for us that time fresh

382
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,560
prince of bel-air

383
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,240
was putting out some of the best comedy

384
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,199
genius on on tv at the time

385
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,320
we had uh the gulf war had kicked off in

386
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,279
1991

387
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,120
interesting story my brother was

388
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,360
actually on his way to deployment he was

389
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,399
a tanker

390
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,199
in the fourth infantry division and he

391
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:47,600
got

392
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,199
what was his first dui so instead they

393
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,079
sent him to

394
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,880
fort irwin california which if you look

395
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,440
is one of the hottest places in america

396
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,040
and he actually helped train the

397
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,720
mississippi national guard who never

398
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,920
deployed

399
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,639
um so he was one of two people out of

400
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,279
almost a

401
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,160
thousand in his unit that never actually

402
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,519
deployed

403
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,959
um so uh if you look at this picture

404
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,480
this is my graduation

405
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,399
picture from my my what they call a

406
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,800
class a school or your basic school

407
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,920
it was uh eight months um what you'll

408
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,399
notice

409
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,399
though is i'm actually not in this

410
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,959
picture and that leads me to my next

411
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:27,920
failure

412
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,199
so i literally almost flu flunked out of

413
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,120
this of this navy school

414
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,800
which um if when you join the navy

415
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,440
and you have what's called a rating or a

416
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,079
career

417
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,759
field if you flunk out of that school

418
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,839
they usually send you out to the fleet

419
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,120
undesignated

420
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,600
what that means is you're the lowest of

421
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,560
low

422
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,839
you do basically whatever you're told

423
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,680
you usually work debt division which is

424
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,360
painting and scraping and

425
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,160
you know uh doing all that kind of stuff

426
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,519
not saying there's anything wrong with

427
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,040
that but i'm just going to draw your

428
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,560
attention back to the

429
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,120
mostly works in air conditioned spaces

430
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,680
is

431
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,880
what brought me to this field so uh this

432
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,959
special shout out to a man named terry

433
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,480
chimsky um ski actually

434
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
helped me through the module that i

435
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,639
failed more than once called

436
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,880
a special circuits and if you know

437
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,839
anything about

438
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,880
jk flip-flops or logical functions um

439
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,920
i just couldn't do it

440
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,600
couldn't do it so i was 17 of 17

441
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,839
once i actually graduated from my from

442
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,040
my class

443
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,000
and then i went on to an advanced school

444
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,399
for some reason the navy decided to give

445
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,040
me

446
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,680
an advanced school right out of the gate

447
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,480
there

448
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,240
during the first half of the course i

449
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,639
was number five of six in the second

450
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,000
half of the course i was six

451
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,160
of six so i'll just say that my

452
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,759
priorities weren't necessarily in the

453
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,480
right place

454
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,680
right order uh my lesson from this is

455
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,839
always trudge forward um make

456
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,400
deliberate baby steps if i was to look

457
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,439
at the complete big picture during this

458
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,640
year of my life it would have sucked

459
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,280
but because i really focused day to day

460
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,720
you know this is what i have to do

461
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
tomorrow to stay in school

462
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,480
this is what i have to do tomorrow to

463
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,760
stay in school

464
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,599
that's what actually helped me get

465
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,000
through this time

466
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,039
um 1994 is my next biggest failure what

467
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,720
we had going here was a

468
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,240
tlc i mean come on if you were alive in

469
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,280
in 1994 tlc was where it's at

470
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,799
um but my problem was at this point

471
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,400
after my advanced school i was on

472
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,520
submarines

473
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,600
and i was doing maintenance we would

474
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,760
bring our equipment on

475
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
we would fabricate the materials that

476
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,679
would hold it in place

477
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,600
we would install it we would maintain it

478
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,360
i was really good at that

479
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,480
i was still an idiot who was 20 years

480
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,200
old

481
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,160
and had problems with the other parts of

482
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,039
my life

483
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:07,039
such as uh i was laid a lot

484
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,160
so i almost actually

485
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,320
um was arrested under use ucmj article

486
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,520
87

487
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,919
and i still remember with this ucmj is

488
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,160
the uniform code of military justice

489
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,080
and it's basically the legal or the laws

490
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,760
above and beyond our federal and state

491
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,799
laws that govern u.s military

492
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,400
and missing movement literally means to

493
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,520
jump from a vessel uh or miss

494
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,720
the deployment of the vessel um any

495
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,919
person subject to this chapter who

496
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,440
through the neglect

497
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,320
or design misses the movement of a ship

498
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,919
aircraft or unit which the

499
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,679
person is required in the course of duty

500
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,120
to move um shall be punished as a quartz

501
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,440
marshal made direct i still remember the

502
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,640
language of that

503
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,720
because of all the dumb things i'd done

504
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,160
before and all the failures i'd had

505
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,039
before this was

506
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,080
really the one that really had me you

507
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,520
know it was a wake up moment and the

508
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,240
reason for

509
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,640
that is because you could get a

510
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,400
dishonorable discharge

511
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,799
uh you could get confinement for up to

512
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:15,919
two years

513
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,160
and loss of pay for that whole time

514
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,679
you're confined

515
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,240
luckily i had a commanding officer who

516
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,200
had actually

517
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,799
missed ship's movement as a young sailor

518
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,400
he had i think at that time 26 years in

519
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,880
he dismissed all the charges which

520
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,160
everyone

521
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,600
uh and it was a closed-door session that

522
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,240
we had

523
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,520
meaning that it wasn't uh public

524
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,919
the only outcome that was made public

525
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:44,559
was

526
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,960
i was gonna have to deploy on that same

527
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,600
ship

528
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,520
for 90 days so

529
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,320
uh what i learned from this is you can

530
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,880
you can

531
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,480
pretty much survive almost anything

532
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,120
for 90 days because i'll tell you once i

533
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,080
got on that ship

534
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,799
i understand why you know i thought he

535
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,400
was lenient

536
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,080
but that was probably the biggest

537
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,600
punishment i've ever had

538
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,559
because i really had to grow up and

539
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,840
basically

540
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,720
uh you know i had 112 people i think on

541
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,000
on that submarine

542
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,640
who were all relying on me uh for

543
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,360
deployment

544
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,440
and i screwed that up for him so that

545
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,559
was a big one

546
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,280
so more on that later because even

547
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,679
though i learned a lesson

548
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,440
i didn't necessarily learn how to apply

549
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,799
the lesson

550
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,520
all right next milestone 1999. i mean

551
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,799
the highlight of this

552
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,039
britney spears and christina aguilera

553
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,919
hello

554
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,760
this was right before they both went

555
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,280
absolutely nuts

556
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,320
and um uh fight club was ruling the

557
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,200
theaters

558
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,400
uh one of my favorite movies um

559
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,880
fight club and less than zero favorite

560
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,679
movies

561
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,679
and then we have this little thing

562
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,720
called y2k that we had to work with

563
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,919
at that time i was doing long-haul

564
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,520
communications for the navy

565
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,320
i was uh stationed in suitland maryland

566
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,400
and we were responsible for well over

567
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,200
500 circuits i'm talking everything from

568
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,919
satellite

569
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,600
dial-up which was uh like none 9.6

570
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,960
bod um all the way up to yeah

571
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,840
i said broad not not like kilobits per

572
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,799
second was just

573
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,919
9.6 bonds we had several

574
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,919
uh t1s which at that time was a 1.544

575
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,760
megabits per second so we're starting to

576
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,640
get to some

577
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,120
modern day speeds and then we had a

578
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,080
single oc 48 pipe which were i think was

579
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,880
2.5 gig gigabits per second

580
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,799
so we had like i said well over 500

581
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,159
circuits

582
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,280
um y2k was coming there was a lot that

583
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,640
we had to do

584
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,640
if you weren't around for y2k uh

585
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,039
we were told anything from the lights

586
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,080
would flicker

587
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,679
to airplanes are going to fall out of

588
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,520
the sky was going to happen

589
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,480
it was really depending on who you

590
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,600
listened to

591
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,840
it was either going to be nothing or the

592
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,120
end of the world

593
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,840
um so we're making preparations for this

594
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,000
i was told i specifically was told

595
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
because i was a team leader at that time

596
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,840
i had six maintenance people working for

597
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,120
me and

598
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,360
what we were supposed to do was shut

599
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,640
down all

600
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,360
non-essential equipment and then shut

601
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,480
down the breakers

602
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,559
for those uh for all of those racks in

603
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,320
the communication center

604
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,679
um it was easy we had multiple panels

605
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,960
they were color coded uh if it was red

606
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,880
it was emergency in other words those

607
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,039
had to operate at all costs

608
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,640
um if it was gray or blue

609
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,159
then it was uh you know not uh necessary

610
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,440
equipment

611
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,039
so my boss told me to to

612
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,919
you know prove to him that everything

613
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,000
was turned off that was non-essential

614
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,679
so after we had done the shutdown

615
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,520
closed all the breakers i'm sorry opened

616
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,600
all the breakers uh he said that's

617
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,039
whenever he came in and said i approved

618
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:07,360
me

619
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,240
so i walked over to the panels i mean

620
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,679
these were huge panels in the

621
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,360
communication center she had to use two

622
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,320
hands and blow

623
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,400
you know throw that main breaker so

624
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,159
throw the breaker pop

625
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,400
go to the second one throw the brick pop

626
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,000
go to the third one throw the breaker

627
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,159
pop hey what happened to our linux

628
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,080
servers

629
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,400
the voice i didn't recognize and the

630
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,840
reason was

631
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,960
is because unbeknownst to me so we were

632
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,679
a secure area secured from the rest of

633
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,240
the building

634
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,880
that was a secure area and then they had

635
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,760
carved out

636
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,400
space from our secure area to set up

637
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,200
another

638
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,919
communication center that communication

639
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:46,480
center

640
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,080
was so secure

641
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,760
that they whenever they installed all

642
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,919
their equipment they didn't want

643
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,799
labels on our breakers to give you know

644
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,799
give a clue what they did

645
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,000
so they removed the labels uh not only

646
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,360
that

647
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,600
our emergency panel the one that had to

648
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,919
stay up at all times

649
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,679
it was full so they went to one of our

650
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,240
non-essential or non-emergency panels

651
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,279
uh wired in their circuits took the

652
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,960
label off and whenever i threw that

653
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,080
breaker

654
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,240
all 100 105

655
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,919
uh unix and

656
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,080
other types of servers crashed

657
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,000
so what i learned from this is um

658
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,240
always approach your procedural

659
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,120
documents

660
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,240
as incomplete or flawed

661
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,520
um we're humans we're the ones tasked

662
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,200
with keeping up with procedure and

663
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,440
policy and things of those nature

664
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,440
um sometimes they just get

665
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,480
left behind not updated

666
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,679
so also i learned that unix servers are

667
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,080
really

668
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,440
hard to recover from a from a

669
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,480
shutdown and

670
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,279
always provide ups support for your

671
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,480
servers

672
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,159
all right on top of that i also

673
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,360
learned that you can do anything for 90

674
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,720
days because that's about how long it

675
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,600
took us to

676
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,320
completely recover from shutting down

677
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,799
the other communication center

678
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,080
that was fun all right so my next

679
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,240
milestone was 2002.

680
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,880
uh at this time i mean nickelback was

681
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,640
absolutely killing it

682
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,720
and if you're laughing about nickelback

683
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,919
you should know

684
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,200
that they are on the top five album

685
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,559
seller list of all time so

686
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,640
go look it up if you don't believe me

687
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,240
they rock

688
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,080
i i tried to say that with a straight

689
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,159
face some other music i do like

690
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,039
uh the other thing hey leo leonardo

691
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,039
dicaprio he could actually grow a beard

692
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,400
at this point in his life or

693
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,000
at least the makings of a beard um

694
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,799
and then uh this is also where i learned

695
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,080
my alter ego

696
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,440
uh it was sally mae so at this time i

697
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,799
actually was stationed

698
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,679
at a royal air force base in uh digby

699
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,480
england uh

700
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,559
lincolnshire was the county and um

701
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,600
so because of my role there once again

702
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,279
i'd gone from a

703
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,440
communication center with over 500

704
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,640
circuits

705
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,600
the communication center at digby for

706
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,640
the us

707
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,080
navy was two circuits and despair

708
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,080
so three total um so i had a lot of

709
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,400
you know idle time on my hands and what

710
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,360
the military is

711
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,279
really good at doing is making sure that

712
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,039
you have no idle time

713
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,640
so in addition to being the

714
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,320
communications guy

715
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,080
they actually made me the um

716
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,279
uh system administrator for

717
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,720
for our network and yeah

718
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,919
but the first thing i'm going to tell

719
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,480
you my first failure here other than my

720
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,600
choice of wardrobe was um

721
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,440
the fact that the us military uses a lot

722
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,559
of hardware encryption devices um

723
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,279
and in doing so they have to share uh

724
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,120
pre-shared keys

725
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,120
uh for this particular encryption that

726
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,440
we were using the pre-shared key

727
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,799
came in a plastic canister and

728
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,279
it was a paper tape that had been you

729
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,799
know holes punched in it

730
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,480
and it was an optical reader that you

731
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,919
would pull it through

732
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,679
you would load it into the reader then

733
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,360
you would load it into the crypto device

734
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,279
you would do what we call a bump

735
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,760
which means you simply interrupt the

736
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,279
circuit for a second

737
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,399
and then as long as the other end had

738
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,200
loaded theirs within a certain window it

739
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,080
would just come back

740
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,559
up and things were good the problem is

741
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,320
is if you're not paying attention

742
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,559
whenever you're pulling that paper out

743
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,279
you get to a perforated edge that's

744
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,120
supposed to be a tear edge

745
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,120
i was talking cutting up carrying on

746
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,320
like i normally do

747
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,120
so i'm just pulling tape and i pulled

748
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,600
past that mark well you can't push back

749
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,240
in

750
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
so if you pull past that mark where you

751
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,159
can read the first character of the

752
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,960
title of that next script

753
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,600
that's called a double pull and you have

754
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,279
to fill out a lot of paperwork

755
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:26,080
now interestingly enough because of

756
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,679
in in the early 90s we had a former

757
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,679
sailor that actually was selling a lot

758
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,240
of

759
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,039
uh uh crypto the pull tape to the

760
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,799
soviets at the time

761
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,799
um we had something called two person

762
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:39,919
integrity

763
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,840
and uh the fact that i pulled this tape

764
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,640
further

765
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,840
was actually more of a you know

766
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,240
an issue than missing ships movement

767
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,360
previously

768
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,840
so there was an investigation to that uh

769
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,520
you know to make sure i wasn't trying to

770
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,480
sell this

771
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,760
crypto tape to the russians

772
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,799
and and um once i was cleared

773
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,320
um they actually uh you know

774
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,120
it was a non-issue uh but yeah that was

775
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,760
uh

776
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,679
that was three months of my life that i

777
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,520
wish i could have gotten back

778
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,760
so what i learned from this basically is

779
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,880
attention to detail

780
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,559
it's fundamental i mean there's 99 you

781
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,279
know 90

782
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,440
of our life you don't have to be paying

783
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,240
attention uh your brain is gonna

784
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,360
you know do things on its own uh but man

785
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,720
that other ten percent

786
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,039
is truly important so make sure you

787
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,000
figure out

788
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,039
especially within security um what that

789
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,640
ten percent is

790
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,880
all right uh next milestone 2003 so the

791
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,760
next year

792
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,320
uh basically i was still in england and

793
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,679
um

794
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,520
sorry and uh you know once i got cleared

795
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,000
uh then the navy allowed me to re-enlist

796
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,200
because i actually had re-enlistment

797
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,919
paper

798
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,279
paperwork put in um so

799
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,320
we made a little jaunt down to

800
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,840
uh london and um i was i was allowed to

801
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,440
reenlist

802
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,360
but this gets me back into my next story

803
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,880
so like i said i was also the system

804
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,559
administrator because

805
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,200
i knew nothing about active director i'm

806
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,480
sorry um

807
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,279
uh i was a network guy and a

808
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,279
communications guy but they wanted me to

809
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,240
maintain the

810
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,240
the primary domain controller and the

811
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,159
backup domain controller

812
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,799
and whenever we got back from this trip

813
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,000
actually

814
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,240
this was the people in this picture were

815
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,000
literally about 75 percent

816
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,520
of the people that that were in our

817
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,200
command i think

818
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,000
we left like four people back uh just to

819
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,279
stand the watch

820
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,039
but now whenever we got back uh

821
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,799
immediately i was approached and i was

822
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,840
told that our

823
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,200
primary domain controller had failed and

824
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,399
um as a hardware

825
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,039
failure and i needed to promote the

826
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,720
backup domain controller

827
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,240
then you got to remember this is

828
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,600
pre-active directory if you know

829
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,120
anything about active directory you have

830
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,960
some well-established peering that

831
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,679
happens

832
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,919
one goes down the other one takes the

833
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,000
load and you're good to go right you

834
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,039
just

835
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,279
fix the primary one or replace it or not

836
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,039
the primary it's pure

837
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,159
well back in the day you had to actually

838
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:16,880
promote

839
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,000
the backup domain controller everything

840
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,960
went well

841
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,559
we had checklists in place we had um

842
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,799
you know practiced the problem was

843
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,559
because we only had a primary and a

844
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,080
domain and a

845
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,600
backup nobody ever wants to do a full

846
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,840
function test you know they don't want

847
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,880
to say

848
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,640
yeah sure just shut down the primary

849
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,159
we'll stop operations

850
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,559
the business won't be affected too bad

851
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,600
and we'll go ahead and

852
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,799
promote that backup um even though that

853
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:49,200
was

854
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,039
actually in our procedures we were

855
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,960
supposed to do that annually

856
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,360
we had never done it because it always

857
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
you know the mission is too important is

858
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,640
what we kept saying

859
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,279
so what we discovered was our procedures

860
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:01,919
for

861
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,679
doing this uh primary uh you know

862
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,600
taking that offline and bringing up the

863
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,640
backup they were spot on

864
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,559
we had never properly tested our backups

865
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,840
we did monthly full backups weekly

866
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,519
backups and actually the daily

867
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,720
differentials

868
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,440
and for approximately six months leading

869
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,640
up to this

870
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,039
we didn't know that we didn't have good

871
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,360
tapes because we'd never test them

872
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,360
every one of them were either corrupted

873
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,880
because of where we stored them

874
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,919
off-site someone else's facility or

875
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,840
they just weren't being written to so

876
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,159
lesson here you'll hear it in every

877
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,120
military movie train like you fight

878
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,720
check your backups periodically if

879
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,480
you're doing backups and

880
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,880
practice practice practice but more

881
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,480
importantly

882
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,600
do a complete practice don't just go

883
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,440
right up to the edge and say

884
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,360
that's good enough we'll finish that

885
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,559
last mile

886
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,200
you know if it happens because when that

887
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,519
last mile when that failure happens

888
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,440
you're not going to have that last mile

889
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,039
nailed down

890
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,080
so yeah that was a big one

891
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,360
that one hurt too um

892
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,240
all right 2005. so if you were if you

893
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,880
were paying attention in 2005

894
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,880
you basically knew everything there was

895
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,720
to know about destiny's child right they

896
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,880
were basically ruling everything

897
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,200
um in england where i was stationed it

898
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,120
was still a little bit different

899
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,559
but you know they were at least on the

900
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,320
top ten

901
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,200
they had some weird spaniards singing in

902
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,080
english

903
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,720
that for some reason we're always number

904
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,679
two

905
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,360
um but anyway then we if you're into

906
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,640
into uh rugby like i was at the time

907
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,799
uh and especially being stationed in

908
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,880
england at the six nations tournament at

909
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,679
that time

910
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,640
and they just steamrolled everyone that

911
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,399
was exciting to watch i got to watch

912
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,440
every game in england scotland wales

913
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,159
um ireland watched one of the games in

914
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:04,960
ireland

915
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,360
and then uh obviously i watched the the

916
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,000
france

917
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,040
uh game on tv but i mean these guys it's

918
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,800
the first time i've ever seen the hakka

919
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,199
and and that that's a picture of the

920
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,119
hakka right there what they do their war

921
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,879
chant to get them hyped up before they

922
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,359
just kick the crap out of everybody

923
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,520
and then i would show you a picture of

924
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,359
me but hey at the same time

925
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,839
i actually had my hands on season

926
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,159
tickets to see manchester united

927
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,159
which never happens especially for

928
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,918
foreigners unless you got big bucks but

929
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,359
i looked into that

930
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,359
um so if you don't know about manchester

931
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,879
united at the time

932
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,079
they were it this is my boy uh

933
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,960
uh ronaldo right there you at least know

934
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,159
about ronaldo

935
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,839
the guy with his back to us and by the

936
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,520
way i'm on the field right here

937
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,040
taking this picture they wouldn't let me

938
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,320
get closer but they let me take the

939
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,040
picture

940
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,359
gabrielle jensey i mean the dude was

941
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,960
phenomenal defender

942
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,920
out of argentina and we had ruud van

943
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,160
nistelrooy at the time paul scholes

944
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,200
i mean it was just oops it was just they

945
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,400
were killing it

946
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,920
um at this time there were

947
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,119
this milestone wasn't a failure but

948
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,079
um my you know the navy came out and

949
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:16,560
they said

950
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,000
we don't need all these maintenance

951
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,680
people so we're going to create a new

952
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,520
rate and we're going to call it

953
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,880
in for you know ctn for networks

954
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,800
and that's going to be different from

955
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,440
like our it personnel

956
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,359
the ctns are actually going to be

957
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,119
analysts and they're not going to

958
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,960
analyze our networks they're going to

959
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,119
analyze our adversaries networks

960
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,880
um so they actually retrained me they

961
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,560
sent me back to back to pensacola

962
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,320
florida for a six-month course called

963
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,520
basic digital network analysis and um

964
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,160
it wasn't basic at all so this was some

965
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,800
very

966
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,000
in-depth network engineering courses and

967
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,680
intelligence analysis courses so it was

968
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,160
uh

969
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,040
it was hard luckily i had learned

970
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,960
something from my previous failures

971
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,240
and i did pretty well in this class uh

972
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,240
because i did well enough as soon as i

973
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,599
got to fort gordon

974
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,480
georgia which is my duty station um they

975
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,200
picked me up for a follow-on course up

976
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,320
at fort meade

977
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,119
so for 90 days i actually went to a very

978
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:17,920
intensive

979
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,800
uh intelligence analyst course up there

980
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,359
and

981
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,800
what you would do is they they would

982
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,480
give you a target

983
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,720
you would work this target for 90 days

984
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
and in order to graduate

985
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,119
um you actually had to present your

986
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,800
target package

987
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,280
uh to a lot of the the like the

988
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,320
directors of

989
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,400
of are the associate directors there's

990
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,000
only one director of nsa

991
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,160
for the associate directors you had to

992
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,280
do it with your

993
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,200
cryptologic components so i actually had

994
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,119
a flag

995
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,480
um and admiral come in for some of our

996
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,599
presentations

997
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,760
and what they did was they gave you an

998
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
honest assessment either a thumbs up or

999
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,680
a thumbs down

1000
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,800
whether they would hire you for their

1001
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,280
organization based off of that 90 days

1002
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,640
of material

1003
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,640
and we had probably a 20 failure rate

1004
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,839
um i was well on my way oh and by the

1005
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:12,560
way

1006
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,480
they would teach you a new concept a new

1007
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,079
tool a new technique

1008
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,680
and then you would spend a couple of

1009
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,920
days applying that to your target so

1010
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,200
we're talking

1011
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,960
really advanced material here some

1012
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,800
really good coursework

1013
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,079
um 45 days in

1014
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,119
uh i'll say that we had some

1015
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,960
geopolitical forces at work and

1016
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,079
that led to my target being changed

1017
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,440
so i had to then create a target package

1018
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,200
to graduate that i was going to brief in

1019
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,960
front of all these people

1020
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,000
with 45 days left

1021
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,160
so that is uh that was something that

1022
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,400
that i didn't think i was going to make

1023
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,440
it through

1024
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,560
um but my lesson there is uh

1025
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,240
teamwork i mean the military is always

1026
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,160
on always about teamwork

1027
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,040
except in training environments usually

1028
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,920
so

1029
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,800
whenever you you're an intel analyst

1030
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,359
they don't

1031
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,760
want you talking to other intel analysts

1032
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,880
until you graduate

1033
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,000
and then all of a sudden they want to

1034
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,760
incorporate all this teamwork right

1035
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,200
different than ground units

1036
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,480
they typically want you to uh to work

1037
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,680
right off the bat

1038
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,320
but so the other thing that i learned is

1039
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,680
work life balance

1040
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,800
can get skewed and it can

1041
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,160
suck but once again pulling back from

1042
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,720
that

1043
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,800
missing ship's movement many years

1044
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,000
earlier

1045
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,839
i realized that you know you can do

1046
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,839
almost anything for 90 days and in this

1047
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:40,560
case

1048
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,000
45 days so that was one of the first

1049
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,200
times i truly

1050
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,680
started to understand my lessons and

1051
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,640
were able to apply them

1052
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,079
all right so next is uh 2006.

1053
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,560
this was a big milestone as a personal

1054
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,599
setback for me

1055
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,359
very little to do with the military i

1056
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,160
actually had a motorcycle wreck

1057
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,680
so i woke up

1058
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,440
literally at the medical college of

1059
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,520
georgia about seven days later

1060
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,119
and they transferred me to the va

1061
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,359
hospital i was there for four months

1062
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,839
i learned that morphine withdrawal is a

1063
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:16,800
real thing

1064
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,839
it does make you itch and i learned how

1065
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:20,560
to walk again

1066
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,520
so so that was a that was a positive it

1067
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,880
but it sucked

1068
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,200
now about 30 days after i got out of the

1069
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,160
va hospital

1070
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,520
i got this nice little breach

1071
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,440
notification from the federal

1072
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,119
federal government and then i got one

1073
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,359
right after that from the va

1074
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,320
saying hey sorry uh your your stuff was

1075
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,680
on the laptop

1076
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,320
and it was stolen from the person that

1077
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,280
that

1078
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,359
you know was put in charge of it uh on a

1079
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,480
train

1080
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,400
so um my lesson there is

1081
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,320
uh others have the keys to the kingdom

1082
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,880
your kingdom there's very little you can

1083
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,920
do about it

1084
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,359
right uh especially after the fact so

1085
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,520
that sucked uh but uh once again

1086
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,599
uh i'm gonna do a time frame here from

1087
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,079
2011 to 2014.

1088
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,720
had a lot of little mini failures i had

1089
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,560
retired from the navy which which was

1090
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,280
good

1091
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,359
i decided because of that whole va

1092
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,640
incident that i would go to work in

1093
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,160
healthcare whenever i got out

1094
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,920
landed a great job in healthcare and

1095
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,920
really the only thing i had

1096
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,160
during this time period was just a lot

1097
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,839
of really bad decisions about facial

1098
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:30,480
hair

1099
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,599
so everything from beards to lamb chops

1100
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,480
to

1101
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,599
flu man shoes and goatees and handlebar

1102
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,079
mustaches

1103
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,200
but the biggest thing here is uh

1104
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,640
at the healthcare organization i was

1105
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,880
with i was a senior security analyst

1106
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,760
and one of the things my boss said was

1107
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,440
uh you seem to be comfortable in front

1108
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,079
of people

1109
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,880
you're now in charge of training so that

1110
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,599
was uh basically a collateral duty that

1111
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,640
i was given

1112
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,960
uh it wasn't part of my primary duties

1113
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,599
um but i really took it to heart right i

1114
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,599
i really like the guys one of my one of

1115
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,000
my best

1116
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,280
friends one of the best guys i've ever

1117
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,280
worked for and uh

1118
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,599
i came up with this concept of called

1119
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,880
ask the geek

1120
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,119
so think um you know uh the the genius

1121
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:17,520
bar

1122
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,520
right only i was gonna be the security

1123
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,960
genius within our healthcare

1124
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,079
organization

1125
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,599
so i got a budget i did presentations in

1126
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,960
the hospital

1127
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,400
i did this booth called ask the geek

1128
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,880
and i think the most number of people

1129
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,640
that i touched in

1130
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,000
from 2011 to 2014 was like seven

1131
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,240
i think i literally had conversations

1132
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,359
with seven

1133
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,440
people other than people in passing

1134
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,480
picking up stuff and walking away

1135
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,560
i tried to pass out gift cards all kinds

1136
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,560
of stuff just they weren't having it

1137
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,359
so my lesson here is a passion does not

1138
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,160
necessarily translate into success

1139
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,280
it can it's a lot of time what motivates

1140
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,079
success

1141
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,040
but it's not necessary a couple of more

1142
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,000
milestones

1143
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,359
uh 2015 i was a managing consultant for

1144
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,640
mssp

1145
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,119
um i did a lot of charity work i

1146
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,640
actually went over to

1147
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,240
uh to kenya did some charity work there

1148
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,520
i actually went over to uganda

1149
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,280
by where hackers for charity was and i

1150
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,119
worked with an organization called soul

1151
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,079
hope

1152
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,720
and then of course i went to jinja

1153
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,440
uganda

1154
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,240
and myself and my family actually uh

1155
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,119
went and taught

1156
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,440
at the hackers for charity uh facility

1157
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,240
there

1158
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,280
which is really uh inspiring

1159
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,760
the problem was just the week i got back

1160
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,720
i was met with

1161
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,720
a hey here's a new hire someone we hired

1162
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,000
while you were gone

1163
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,040
and he's in charge of two uh payment

1164
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,520
card

1165
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,160
uh assessments and they're going on

1166
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,680
concurrently

1167
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,520
and um not a big deal i mean the guy had

1168
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,280
five years of experience have been doing

1169
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,640
this on his own

1170
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,319
because i didn't know him i would check

1171
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,960
in often right show him the ropes i sat

1172
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,240
in some of his interview sessions

1173
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,599
whenever it came down to the end i kept

1174
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,200
telling the whole time

1175
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,359
make sure you're writing your reports as

1176
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,480
you go

1177
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,800
we have a very strict time frame that we

1178
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,760
work with

1179
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,240
and i didn't check all of his artifacts

1180
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,119
nor did i

1181
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,040
monitor his reporting and basically his

1182
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:25,520
work

1183
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,040
was absolute trash uh the reports

1184
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,880
were turned into the client two weeks

1185
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,520
late we ended up losing that client

1186
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,560
and uh my lesson there was an oldie but

1187
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,920
goodie ronald reagan

1188
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,400
trust but verify if you've never seen

1189
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,680
that speech he gave

1190
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,480
about the soviet union i recommend it

1191
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,200
the other thing i learned is

1192
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,200
i already had the knowledge skills and

1193
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,560
abilities to manage

1194
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,040
and lead the us navy instilled that in

1195
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:53,599
me

1196
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,560
we used a model a leadership model

1197
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,560
called the situational leadership model

1198
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,359
basically four quadrants um how much

1199
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,240
monitoring

1200
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,720
should occur based on someone new to

1201
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,520
their job

1202
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,640
new to the area you know new to the

1203
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,480
to the commander or in this case the

1204
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,240
business and um

1205
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,480
i just i didn't employ that so make sure

1206
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,400
um reach back do those things you've

1207
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:20,800
been

1208
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,839
taught to do but are sometimes hard

1209
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,520
right uh next big milestone

1210
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,800
uh 2017 so a couple of years after this

1211
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,800
incident we had actually got bought out

1212
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,440
by

1213
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,240
what i would call globo core it was

1214
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,000
competitor to att

1215
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,880
very large organization we were like the

1216
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,800
30th security company in the world that

1217
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,079
they had purchased

1218
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,000
and um things weren't going so well

1219
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,200
ended up my new boss was very

1220
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,280
authoritarian type hostile working

1221
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,200
environment that kind of thing

1222
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,560
so i jumped ship and i spent more time

1223
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,000
in tampa than any human person

1224
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,119
should i like tampa

1225
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,880
but not that much when i wasn't in tampa

1226
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,040
by the way i live in lexington kentucky

1227
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,200
so this was all travel

1228
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,400
i was with clients in argentina and

1229
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,599
clients in india

1230
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,680
and salt lake city uh so

1231
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,160
what went wrong here is it's a very

1232
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,280
small company

1233
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,800
uh had a startup feel uh it was very

1234
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,800
exciting at first uh but that was for

1235
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,000
about a month

1236
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,079
and then that's whenever i realized that

1237
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,920
the you know 50

1238
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,839
travel they told me about was actually

1239
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,680
about 80 travel

1240
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,599
there were unrealistic expectations

1241
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,200
placed on the employees

1242
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,000
especially the consultants and it's the

1243
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,720
only

1244
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,400
job that i ever actually feel that i

1245
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,920
just quit

1246
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,280
um i quit before

1247
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,480
my first year so it was bad enough

1248
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,319
it was the highest paying job i've ever

1249
00:45:58,319 --> 00:45:59,520
had in my life

1250
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,440
and it was bad enough that i turned down

1251
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,720
the 20

1252
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,400
bonus that i was supposed to get in

1253
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,319
january but i just said

1254
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,200
enough's enough and my lesson here is

1255
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,119
it's easier to find a job when you have

1256
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:11,920
a job

1257
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,440
and always perform exhaustive research

1258
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,599
before you accept an offer so this was

1259
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,440
the only time i ever actually looked at

1260
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,440
money and it was definitely a mistake

1261
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,720
so uh but it did speaking of mistakes it

1262
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,400
did allow me to buy a lot of steak

1263
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,160
whenever i was in argentina

1264
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,560
and make some good friends in uh in

1265
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,839
india

1266
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,680
all right so that's kind of it about my

1267
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,200
um

1268
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,720
my failures i've only got a couple of

1269
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,640
more slides left

1270
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,720
but what i wanted to leave you with was

1271
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,520
was two more concepts number one is

1272
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,920
what i call the four pillars of a career

1273
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,079
so in order to have career success these

1274
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,040
are kind of the

1275
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,000
the my wife calls them irreducible

1276
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,960
truths

1277
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,160
these are the the root cause for a good

1278
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,040
career um number one and i'm not saying

1279
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,319
you have to have all of them

1280
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,560
i know some very successful people that

1281
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,440
were installing

1282
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,240
car stereos and are now very influential

1283
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,480
people in information security

1284
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,560
as pen testers are running organizations

1285
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,160
so i'm not saying these are all a

1286
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,079
necessity just from

1287
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,760
my experience the more of these you have

1288
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,440
the easier it is or or the better

1289
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,559
jobs you can get i've never had a gap

1290
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,640
in in my in my um my career

1291
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,079
i've always had um at least

1292
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,640
one job if not two that overlapped uh

1293
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,200
even

1294
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,680
even the day i quit but the first one is

1295
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,520
education and training

1296
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,960
uh it helps to have a degree um

1297
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,000
a lot of especially corporate america

1298
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,839
they want to see a degree and that's

1299
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,680
usually one of the limiting

1300
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,559
factors for not giving an interview the

1301
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:57,359
second one

1302
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,559
is experience u.s

1303
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,640
government is really good in that if

1304
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,559
they require a master's degree but you

1305
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,800
have 15 years of experience then they

1306
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,119
can

1307
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,200
you can come down to an associates in

1308
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,160
some positions

1309
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,880
and your your experience is counted you

1310
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,319
know as a part of the

1311
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:18,319
positive field but yeah experience

1312
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,800
even without a degree or certifications

1313
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,480
which is the next one can get your foot

1314
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,599
in the door and give you a lot of

1315
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:24,720
opportunities

1316
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,520
um that brings us to the next one

1317
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,160
certifications

1318
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,760
so uh just like education

1319
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,839
you don't have to have a certification

1320
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,520
but it really helps

1321
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,760
once again hr will block you

1322
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,480
from even getting an interview a lot of

1323
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,319
times just the way the job interview or

1324
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:45,200
the job

1325
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,359
requirements are written and then the

1326
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,240
most important one probably is

1327
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:55,680
timing so i've had some opportunities

1328
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,400
i was going to get back into pen testing

1329
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,240
and

1330
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,000
i hadn't done i think the last time i

1331
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,599
did an actual

1332
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,599
paid pen test i was using uh backtrack

1333
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,400
so that'll tell you how how long ago

1334
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,359
that was

1335
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,559
um but anyway all that to say you know

1336
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,599
there were times where i had everything

1337
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,280
i needed for a position

1338
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,200
but i was too late in applying for the

1339
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,760
position and then there were times where

1340
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,920
i didn't have everything these other

1341
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,119
three pillars

1342
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,800
uh but i was at the right place at the

1343
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,880
right time and

1344
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,040
have the answers they were looking for

1345
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,559
so so that's key

1346
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,240
uh next to last slide so we have um

1347
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,599
uh and this is uh kind of my my be all

1348
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:42,400
endo

1349
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,160
uh beware those who are perfection

1350
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,280
um whenever it comes to imposter

1351
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,319
syndrome

1352
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,359
the thing that always hit me hard

1353
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,760
was usually the time period after coming

1354
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,200
back from a conference

1355
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,359
and the reason why i say that is because

1356
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:00,240
i see these

1357
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,440
legends on uh you know uh

1358
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,839
on a platform uh talking about their

1359
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,200
conquests

1360
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,160
and what you never hear are rarely here

1361
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,000
because there are some people out there

1362
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,160
that are true rock stars that actually

1363
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,920
are going to give you the nitty-gritty

1364
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,559
and all the failures uh dave kennedy is

1365
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,160
one of one of the examples

1366
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,000
for every success he talks about he

1367
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,520
usually talks about a failure that he's

1368
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,160
had

1369
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,599
um or or delays or you know inability to

1370
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:28,800
get something to work

1371
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,599
uh which is which is great um but yeah

1372
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,040
that feeling that whatever we do is just

1373
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:37,440
not

1374
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,559
good enough like i said it it can hit us

1375
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:41,440
hard

1376
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,720
and um i've actually turned down

1377
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,079
jobs uh not because of the risk involved

1378
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,760
because like i said i'm a husband i'm a

1379
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,319
father

1380
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,240
that's my primary i'm gonna take care of

1381
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,240
my family first

1382
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,559
but i've turned down jobs not because it

1383
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:57,760
was a threat to

1384
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,200
or a risk to that but because i

1385
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,640
just felt like i was going to let

1386
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,119
someone down and they're taking a chance

1387
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:05,599
on me

1388
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,839
why would they do that i still suffer

1389
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:10,079
from that today

1390
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,599
but what i discovered is is like social

1391
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:14,880
networking apps

1392
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,359
conferences they give a false picture of

1393
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,359
what reality is

1394
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:21,040
so as you're listening to some of these

1395
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,079
presenters just realize that

1396
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,240
they're they're giving you 10 hours

1397
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,760
worth of work

1398
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,480
that summarizes hundreds of hours of

1399
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,520
failures

1400
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,319
at times so so keep that in mind and

1401
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:34,640
then

1402
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,839
my takeaways for this are always

1403
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,680
reevaluate your plans

1404
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,640
uh look inward self-actualization right

1405
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,680
nothing you see is reality so if you

1406
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,280
if you go into it as a skeptic

1407
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,839
but with eyes wide open you'll learn a

1408
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,520
lot and you'll be able to overcome some

1409
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,880
of your own fears

1410
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,119
and set your own standards i mean i

1411
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,640
could have submitted a technical

1412
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,240
presentation to this conference

1413
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,880
you know um but i didn't and it's

1414
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,200
because i wasn't ready to do everything

1415
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,839
involved in in presenting a technical

1416
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:13,839
uh topic this time so i presented this

1417
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,920
and they sell value in it and i hope you

1418
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,040
saw value in it

1419
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,079
and and here i am so i i got to talk at

1420
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:20,319
a

1421
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:23,760
technical conference on a non-technical

1422
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,640
uh topic and and i hope it's done you

1423
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:26,880
know

1424
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,319
done something for you um i practice

1425
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:31,280
this phrase

1426
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,880
often in my mind whenever i meet someone

1427
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,240
i simply say your opinion doesn't matter

1428
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,079
and i say that over and over and over

1429
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,599
until i feel comfortable

1430
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,319
talking to that person and just make

1431
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,079
sure you don't say it out loud i've done

1432
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,440
that you know i've slipped up our time

1433
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,119
with you

1434
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,040
that that's not a way to start a

1435
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,480
relationship

1436
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,079
so um so that act actually is all i have

1437
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,160
i know there's like five minutes left

1438
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,480
hopefully i didn't bore you to tears and

1439
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,480
i'm gonna open it up for uh questions if

1440
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,280
anybody has

1441
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,200
questions your opinion doesn't matter

1442
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:07,920
that's funny

1443
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,920
and you're right don't ever say that out

1444
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,359
loud

1445
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,520
yeah i've done there's a time or two by

1446
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,960
accident

1447
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,720
and it really puts a damper on things

1448
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,880
well i'll tell you i suffer from

1449
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,160
imposter syndrome

1450
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,680
uh you know i that that just especially

1451
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,480
now that i'm

1452
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,640
you know i've kind of started doing a

1453
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,680
little job search on the side myself and

1454
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,040
you know you it's it's really scary um

1455
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,880
you know you you start applying for

1456
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,400
these jobs and you think oh man there's

1457
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,880
no way i can do this but uh

1458
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,319
you know you just have to power through

1459
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,319
it and and you know

1460
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,000
what do you what do you find helps you

1461
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,480
the most with that

1462
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,559
so matt i i'll tell you that i have

1463
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,800
not applied the positions that i was

1464
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,800
fully qualified for

1465
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,640
uh because it's a new environment

1466
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,760
and and that scared me um but like i

1467
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,319
said i

1468
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:05,680
actually go through these mental

1469
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,520
exercises now um

1470
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,359
the whole thing of your opinion doesn't

1471
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,359
matter that's just one of the many

1472
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:12,559
things that i say

1473
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,640
to get myself prepared for for new

1474
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,760
situations

1475
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,160
and it's hilarious because as a as a

1476
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,720
youth as a younger person i didn't care

1477
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,119
i mean if you told me no okay law of

1478
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:24,880
percentages i'm gonna get a yes at some

1479
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,760
point right

1480
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,240
um for some reason now that i'm older

1481
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:28,800
and i have

1482
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,200
i don't want to say responsibilities but

1483
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,200
you know i feel like i feel this need to

1484
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,160
provide

1485
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,520
um i run into this a lot now and it's

1486
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,839
it's actually been bad enough where i've

1487
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:42,559
had epic friends come to me and say

1488
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,559
hey i want to hire you can you start in

1489
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:47,839
30 days and my first response is

1490
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:50,000
no because i'm going to fail you and it

1491
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
takes them back sometimes

1492
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,359
and and it's just you know it's one of

1493
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,359
those things where

1494
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,440
i haven't had to do it a lot but like i

1495
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,960
said i actually go

1496
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,280
it's almost like doing a little chant to

1497
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,880
yourself um

1498
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,400
i've actually had to go into another

1499
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,119
environment and and just

1500
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,000
do some positive reinforcement to myself

1501
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,599
and that really helps

1502
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,280
um and the more you do that the easier

1503
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,359
it becomes unless you have to go away

1504
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,040
you can do that in the moment so that

1505
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,040
that's that's nice

1506
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,280
who would you consider to be a one of

1507
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,079
your

1508
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,079
i don't say role model but maybe a

1509
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,079
mentor that has really helped you along

1510
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,440
in your

1511
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,640
in your career path yeah that's that's a

1512
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,440
good one so

1513
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,559
uh doug fee uh worked he was

1514
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,799
he was my boss uh whenever i got out of

1515
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:40,480
the navy he's the one that hired me

1516
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,760
and that was one of those things where i

1517
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,440
look back now at the interview that i

1518
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,280
had with him and i think

1519
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,760
how did this guy ever hire me right this

1520
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,640
was

1521
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,680
years after i did the job right so i'm

1522
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,359
still dealing with with some of that

1523
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:54,880
those confidence issues

1524
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,680
um but yeah doug one of the best things

1525
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,480
he told me

1526
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,240
is we got a new ceo that was a arms area

1527
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,839
a cto

1528
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,960
that was a former nurse practitioner

1529
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,760
and had come up through that and took a

1530
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,040
couple of classes in i.t

1531
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,920
and she became the cto and what he said

1532
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,599
was

1533
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,480
he came to me and he said i'm concerned

1534
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:18,799
that

1535
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:21,440
you won't be able to grow here anymore

1536
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,599
and so here's a list of people that i

1537
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,920
trust that i think you should call

1538
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,119
and so i was like doug why would you

1539
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,359
you know why would you do this for me

1540
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,599
and his response was

1541
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,880
it wasn't about me what he said was

1542
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,680
i've taught you what i can so that you

1543
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,799
can apply it to

1544
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:44,000
information security here if you take

1545
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,680
that knowledge and do good somewhere

1546
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,680
else i'm happy

1547
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,440
and i thought wow that's the first time

1548
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,200

1549
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,760

1550
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,520
with for years

1551
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,000
people that that had rice bowls and all

1552
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,839
they wanted to do was get rice out of

1553
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,359
your bowl and put it in theirs right

1554
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:02,160
they wanted to build

1555
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,799

1556

imposter syndrome and uh he he counseled

1562
