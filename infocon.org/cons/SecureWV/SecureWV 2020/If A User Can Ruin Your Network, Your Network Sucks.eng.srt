1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,399
uh i actually build the stories into the

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,480
presentation

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,480
but i've been saying this one line

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,240
that if a user can ruin your network

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,719
your network sucks for

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,079
almost a decade now because i guess i'm

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,080
sick and tired of hearing the same

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,119
things like

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,240
oh a user you know a user clicked on

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,240
something on our network that went down

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,720
and frankly if the user can click on any

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,400
significant network at all

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,880
and they you know took your network down

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,360
your network sucks it's the you who is

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,079
stupid not the user in this case

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,000
because you know the the reality is a

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,840
user is going to do something it's

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,280
inevitable

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,879
you know and i'll talk about this in a

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,039
little bit but it's inevitable user is

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,800
going to do something and it's your

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,160
job to make sure the user can't for lack

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,640
of a better term ruin your network

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,680
um okay so let's talk about a cut two

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,600
different attacks to lead off

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,680
first attack was the highly

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,120
sophisticated attack

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,959
and i am being very sarcastic regarding

29
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,760
twitter as many people know a few months

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,640
ago

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,400
what happened was the several or

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,200
a few dozen high-profile twitter

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,240
accounts

34
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,280
basically were hijacked because

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,640
a computer mastermind

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,400
essentially 17-year-old computer

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,479
mastermind mind you

38
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,079
was able to launch according to twitter

39
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,640
sophisticated

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,520
social engineering ambition attacks

41
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,960
against twitter

42
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,520
and was able to go ahead and compromise

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,159
the control systems or the admin systems

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,920
i think they were specifically

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,200
named and was able to then go ahead and

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,680
change

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,840
passwords on very high profile accounts

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,000
such as president obama's account with

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,399
120 million subscribers

50
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,200
and then sell that access supposedly to

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,640
some other criminals

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,680
who then used it for the

53
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,600
uh the mastermind attack of

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,119
you know getting maybe a hundred

55
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,119
thousand dollars by putting a bitcoin

56
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:07,600
scam

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,800
up um yeah so anyway

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
twitter again they had a network

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
engineer i'm not trying to disparage the

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,599
person but i

61
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,400
am being very specific on it was a

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,720
security engineer not an executive

63
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,520
essentially

64
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,400
who went out and was telling everybody

65
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,599
in detail how

66
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,599
twitter was hacked and basically they

67
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,959
kept claiming how

68
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,800
it was a sophisticated social

69
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,080
engineering attack

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,319
and in response they're gonna put some

71
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,160
awareness training up

72
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,720
so in the meantime let's talk about the

73
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,680
17 year old mastermind doing my dr

74
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,599
evil quotes so yeah this was a

75
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,319
17 year old who basically did lots of

76
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,400
social engineering he determined the

77
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,040
location of the administrator tools

78
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,200
and then conducted wishing attacks some

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,040
of which might or might not sound

80
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,879
sophisticated but basically contacted

81
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,760
through a variety of different people

82
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,840
figured out that there were admin tools

83
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,680
who might have general access to the

84
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,200
admin tools

85
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,720
twitter for to its um credit

86
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,319
if you want to call it that had

87
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,560
multi-factor authentication in place and

88
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
what they did was

89
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,760
um the mastermind and again

90
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,760
dr evil quotes mastermind um basically

91
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,879
vished and called twitter admin sup and

92
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,680
said hey

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,440
we need you to log in you know you

94
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,760
should get you know go to the site and

95
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,720
enter your multi-factor authentication

96
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,319
which they then used essentially as a

97
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,080
man in the middle of attack

98
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,120
and you know capture the mfa for those

99
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,920
people

100
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,879
logged in as the admins and then reset

101
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,280
the

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,000
passwords allowing criminals to have

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,959
access to those high profile accounts

104
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,439
and then you know you go ahead and you

105
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,439
figure out you know twitter said again

106
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,319
high sophisticated social engineering

107
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,159
the reality though is when you stop and

108
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,239
think about it from

109
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,120
a rational security perspective in the

110
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,519
first place it turns out that 20 percent

111
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,879
of twitter in other words about a

112
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,400
thousand people

113
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,920
had access to those admin tools and

114
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,759
i don't know about you but a thousand

115
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,000
people have access to admin tools

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,240
pretty bad on occasion yes you probably

117
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,759
have a need for

118
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,320
some people to do that that's one thing

119
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,479
and then stop and think about it

120
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,160
you know and this is what a lot of

121
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,520
people forget back in 2018

122
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,880
there was a um contract employee of

123
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,040
twitter i believe based in germany

124
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
who left twitter and said you know what

125
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,880
we need to take down donald trump's

126
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,759
account

127
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,639
and he just did that on his way out the

128
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,360
door

129
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,199
and donald trump's account was taken

130
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,120
down for a few hours and everybody was

131
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,080
horrified

132
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,400
so here's what you got to realize number

133
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,280
one

134
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,560
everybody understands the insider threat

135
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,199
exists no matter what that's a given

136
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,240
period

137
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,560
but yet they still allowed a thousand

138
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,800
people to have similar access on other

139
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
accounts such as obama's account

140
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,840
with 120 million subscribers without

141
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,639
implementing

142
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,440
any sort of multi not multi-factor

143
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,560
authentication

144
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,600
but multiple users for example i mean i

145
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,639
don't know about you but

146
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,720
i accounts with 120 million people you

147
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,120
want to change the password on that

148
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,520
i mean hell that would be like c level

149
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,120
approval in my opinion for

150
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,919
accounts to that extent but anyway they

151
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,199
will twitter went ahead

152
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,120
blamed it on sophisticated social

153
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,360
engineering despite what i would

154
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,400
consider

155
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,600
you know yes give the mastermind some

156
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,880
credit for

157
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,960
having the putting in the effort to

158
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,479
figure it all out but

159
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,800
again many many systematic problems

160
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,440
occurred throughout that whole thing now

161
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,360
let's go ahead and switch to

162
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,880
cloudflare cloudflare right around the

163
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,000
same time

164
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,160
a significant portion of the cloudflare

165
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,919
network went down and again cloudflare

166
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,280
essentially is an infrastructure

167
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,160
provider

168
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,680
they allow for hosting of different

169
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,199
websites and so on

170
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,080
and those websites were able to go ahead

171
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,440
and

172
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,639
so anyway cloudflare had a problem and

173
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,479
a significant portion of their network

174
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,000
went down now in

175
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,199
this case it turns out it was the

176
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,160
ceo um i believe his name is matt prince

177
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,039
came out

178
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,160
and matt basically went ahead and posted

179
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,600
specifically

180
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,919
what was going on and you know said

181
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,280
here's the problem

182
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,000
some engineer made a typo in a router

183
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
table or something similar i forgot the

184
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,160
specifics but it was essentially a typo

185
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,840
by an engineer

186
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,039
and somebody replied back to matt prince

187
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,000
on twitter and said

188
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,880
gee i'd hate to be that engineer and

189
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,319
matt prince pretty much

190
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,800
immediately replied back saying it's not

191
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,720
the fault of the engineer

192
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,759
it's a failure of leadership it's a

193
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,919
systematic failure on the part of

194
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,840
cloudflare that allows for

195
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,440
a single user making an innocent typo

196
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,680
to allow for the whole infrastructure to

197
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,639
go down

198
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,800
and frankly that is what you might call

199
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,560
extreme ownership

200
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,160
they didn't try to put the blame

201
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,919
anywhere they realized it was a

202
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,599
systematic failure

203
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,800
that one person making one typo

204
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,960
innocently let alone somebody who did

205
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,800
any research to figure out how to

206
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,680
take it out was allowed to do that and

207
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,160
they

208
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,800
did it in what i would consider a very

209
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,080
admirable way

210
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,960
giving credit saying you know people

211
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,160
will make mistakes

212
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,080
it's our problem that a mistake is

213
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,520
allowed to propagate

214
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,440
and cause significant damage to the

215
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,080
network and all of their customers

216
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,440
and again they took ownership

217
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,520
now i like to apply a lot of other

218
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,360
things and it shocks me that in cyber

219
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,800
security

220
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,720
very few people especially all these

221
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,479
people talking awareness that love to

222
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,080
mention things like mental models

223
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,360
gamification

224
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,680
and all these other buzzwords don't

225
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,199
recognize something that's

226
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,520
been out for 100 years called safety

227
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,639
science

228
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,479
in old school and first i'm going to

229
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,400
talk about old school safety science

230
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,039
twitter for example you know when

231
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,280
somebody injures themselves in a factory

232
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,720
environment or whatever

233
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
you know old school safety science said

234
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,879
why did the user do what they do why

235
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,280
were they so stupid to injure themselves

236
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,039
they were essentially focusing on the

237
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,400
proximity of where

238
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,879
an error occurred and then when they did

239
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,120
an analysis it's like okay

240
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,839
why was the user wrong why did the user

241
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,719
do what they do

242
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,120
why did they do that same thing with the

243
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,080
medical profession

244
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,799
when a surgeon would commit an you know

245
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,200
a patient died in the middle of surgery

246
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,959
they would do medical inquiry and the

247
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,959
medical inquiry would say

248
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,040
hey why did that doctor accidentally cut

249
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,279
the wrong thing why did they give them

250
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,680
too much anesthesia or something like

251
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,640
that

252
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,600
and that's how everything used to be and

253
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,440
that's the equivalent of saying

254
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,000
hey if there's a canary that dies in the

255
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,640
coal mine why is the canary so unhealthy

256
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,440
just give the canary a gas mask and as

257
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,360
most of you know the analogy of a canary

258
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,399
in a coal mine

259
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,800
is based upon the fact that it's an

260
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,880
unsafe environment that causes the

261
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,680
canary to die before a human would die

262
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
and the canary is just kind of like the

263
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,040
sensor

264
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,000
you know very inexpensive sensor and but

265
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,519
you know in cyber security

266
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,360
like what twitter said well they were

267
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,279
the victim of the sophisticated social

268
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,399
engineering attack

269
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,240
let's give them more training again it's

270
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,560
like saying we need a healthier canary

271
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,959
as opposed to looking at it as a failure

272
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,560
of the entire system

273
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,560
which i'll go into now here's the issue

274
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,160
you know when i speak when we speak

275
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,080
about the user we're talking about the

276
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,320
proximity of the error

277
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,399
and with the proximity of the error such

278
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,480
as mechanical breakdowns and things like

279
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,120
that

280
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,519
it's like gee why did the user do what

281
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,560
they do

282
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,320
you know why did the user click on the

283
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
phishing link why did those twitter

284
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,839
employees go ahead

285
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,959
and um you know and enter in the

286
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,959
multi-factor authentication under that

287
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,000
sophisticated social engineering attack

288
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,320
the reality though today we realize

289
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,000
there's a significant difference

290
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,959
for example between a user and this is

291
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,640
modern safety science

292
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,399
you know there's a difference for

293
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,800
example between a bus driver

294
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,000
going out drunk and crashing into

295
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,920
something causing the bus to break and

296
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,200
life's to be lost

297
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,920
compared to a bus driver who out

298
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,640
otherwise acts completely reasonable

299
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,760
and then having a defective bus given to

300
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,680
them such as a bad axle where

301
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,000
a tire might fall off or something

302
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,399
likewise with medical postmortems

303
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,920
they've gone ahead and stopped and

304
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,680
realized you know what if a

305
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,880
doctor makes a mistake during surgery

306
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,200
we have to acknowledge that the doctor

307
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,399
generally

308
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,480
does you know not hannibal lecter and

309
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,800
does not intend to kill people

310
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,839
and the bad action resulted frankly not

311
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,079
from the one action that we're concerned

312
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:08,880
about

313
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,040
but from a whole decision string that

314
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,120
went back maybe a hundred or more

315
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,079
actions

316
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,480
and figure out gee maybe if they walk

317
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,160
maybe if they had better information at

318
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,040
the start

319
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,399
you know the issue could have been

320
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,720
avoided maybe if there was like another

321
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,000
sensor like they had a

322
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,880
better blood oxygen type of reading or

323
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,800
something like that they would have done

324
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,600
different things and so on so now these

325
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,720
postmortems look at the entire event

326
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,800
from start to finish and figure out how

327
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,320
they got to the point

328
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,760
and what could have been done throughout

329
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,360
the whole operation that would have

330
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,440
resulted in better situation

331
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,360
which again is the new school of safety

332
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,079
science and cyber security

333
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,200
i essentially translate that into a user

334
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,560
is as much of a part

335
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,079
part of the system as the computer is

336
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,680
and a lot of people want to paint the

337
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,160
users as a paragon of virtue they want

338
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,800
to say

339
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
the users your first and last line of

340
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,000
defense and

341
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,720
those people would be 100 percent

342
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,920
completely

343
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,959
foolish because your user

344
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,839
is just the proximity of them making an

345
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:14,399
error

346
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,639
if you leave a user as your first and

347
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,079
last line of defense

348
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,600
you have failed you have no

349
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,839
understanding of system science and

350
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,519
period that's a given and likewise any

351
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,279
you know any safety incident results

352
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,519
from a failure of the entire system

353
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,680
if for example somebody gets injured in

354
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,279
a factory environment

355
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,440
you know why did they injure themselves

356
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,279
and so on this is why for example they

357
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,360
have back braces knee pads

358
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,639
you know um steel toe boots and all that

359
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,760
sort of stuff

360
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,680
you know they look at how all these

361
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,880
things came to be

362
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,440
all the enabling factors and realize

363
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,399
that for example if something drops

364
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,040
you know like if a heavy object drops on

365
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,079
the toe

366
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,200
of a factory worker you know again steel

367
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,480
toe boots prevent

368
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,720
that sort of damage that's why steel toe

369
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,600
boots exist

370
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,920
but on the other hand maybe the object

371
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,240
was too heavy for that person to lift on

372
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,880
their own

373
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,200
or handle on their own and what else

374
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,079
could have been done

375
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,320
such as possibly you know giving them

376
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,480
lighter loads to move around or

377
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,320
putting better protections in place or

378
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,120
so on but again proximity is just

379
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,560
a symptom as is user error a symptom

380
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,440
when we're talking about cyber security

381
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
um let's talk about something that

382
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,600
you know much like the cloudflare incent

383
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,440
unfortunately something that was

384
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,200
a little bit more dire was the 737 max

385
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,560
jet crashes that happened give or take a

386
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,800
year or more ago at this point

387
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,320
in this case what happened was the

388
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,279
boeing 737 max jets two of them

389
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,560
air and i forgot the other um airline

390
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,600
that was involved but um essentially

391
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,959
the planes went straight into the ground

392
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,639
and everybody was saying why would a

393
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,399
plane go straight into the ground it

394
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,160
must be the pilot's fault

395
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,760
you know similar things happen with

396
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,000
several other planes but in these cases

397
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
the pilots could have couldn't recover

398
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,079
so was it pilot error

399
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,240
and what happened was you know people

400
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,000
started look could the pilots have saved

401
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,959
the plane

402
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,600
and you know what yes the pilots could

403
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,079
have

404
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,560
saved the plane in theory but the two

405
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,959
incidents where the airplanes crashed

406
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,199
were not the only incidents where

407
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,720
problems happened

408
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,880
and there wasn't the proper training

409
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,639
when these incidents happened in the

410
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,600
past

411
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
you know to like say here's what went on

412
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,120
but when you stop and look at

413
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,880
what really enabled the 737 max jets to

414
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,000
crash

415
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,320
it turns out that there were systematic

416
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,320
problems that occurred

417
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,120
during the design of the airplane years

418
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,839
before

419
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,800
possibly almost a decade before so for

420
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,959
example what happened is in previous

421
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,279
versions of the 737 jets

422
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,199
they were looked at the cockpit was the

423
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,600
same so there wasn't a perceived need

424
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,800
for any extra training however what they

425
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,160
didn't tell the pilots

426
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,000
and maybe they put it as a note in a

427
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,839
book that the pilots were supposed to

428
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,480
read

429
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,600
but a little note inside a big document

430
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,240
they basically said well we have these

431
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,040
things called aoas on cytoplanes aoas is

432
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,720
angle of attack sensors

433
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,480
and these angle of attack sensors

434
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,320
generally say if the plane is going up

435
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,279
or down

436
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,519
now there's two of them one on each side

437
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,839
but if there was ever a discrepancy

438
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,199
in past versions of the 737 they would

439
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:31,600
say

440
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,160
hey there's a discrepancy between the

441
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,720
two

442
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,440
mr pilot or miss pilot you need to do

443
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,959
something now

444
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,360
and what happened was you know there was

445
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,079
a warning

446
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,199
and a specific what the issue was on the

447
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:45,839
other hand

448
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,560
with the 737 max jets they rewrote the

449
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,199
software

450
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,800
and one thing they did was they made

451
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,480
this warning indicator

452
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,839
an option so this default

453
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,079
indicator that the pilots had readily

454
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,040
available

455
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,839
they only had that if the airline paid

456
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:02,800
extra for it

457
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,680
which some airlines did not so anyway

458
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,399
the

459
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,519
the problem was so when there was an

460
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,920
uh a discrepancy between one saying the

461
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,360
plane was going up another saying the

462
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,040
plane was going down

463
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,519
the software said well we'll default to

464
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,680
the plane going down because if

465
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,920
the plane's going down clearly it's

466
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,440
safer to bring the plane up because

467
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,040
planes only crash when they hit the

468
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,920
ground

469
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,199
but how you get a plane to go up if it's

470
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,560
going down

471
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,199
is ironically you aim the plane down to

472
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,240
pick up speed

473
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,560
because picking up speed gives the plane

474
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,920
more lift

475
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,160
so the plane was supposedly getting more

476
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,959
lift

477
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,160
but the in they never turned the plane

478
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,480
back

479
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,720
up to take advantage of the lift the

480
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,480
indicators just kept indicating the

481
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,079
plane was going down

482
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,720
so it just kept aiming down more and

483
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,440
more

484
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,519
and the planes crashed into the ground

485
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,360
the indicators were turned away so could

486
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,600
the pilots have saved the plane

487
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,920
yeah if they turned it off and kept off

488
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,120
the autopilot

489
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,520
but the reality was these issues

490
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,559
happened

491
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,520
years before with the pilots given no

492
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,280
proper warning no proper

493
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,160
training or anything to that effect now

494
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,400
in regards to cyber security you know we

495
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,000
hear about the human firewall

496
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,039
we hear about the users being your last

497
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,359
line of defense or your first line

498
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,439
it's not really you we've been fed a

499
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,559
bunch of crap

500
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,200
over the last decade or so where the

501
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,760
users are somehow the paragons of virtue

502
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,520
who would do the right thing

503
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,840
if you just give them the opportunity

504
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,039
and the training

505
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,080
now that's like if you go to a gym you

506
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,919
have the bros in the gym you know drink

507
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,200
more protein bro

508
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,520
you know more squats bro whatever the

509
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,120
case is call each other bro

510
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,679
i call that bro science does it work

511
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,640
what they say

512
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,720
maybe maybe not but really they're only

513
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,919
saying it because the first

514
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,400
they heard it from somebody before so

515
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,440
it's just like these

516
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,520
old wives tales that get passed down

517
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,280
from one road to the other

518
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,520
and that's what we have in the cyber

519
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,760
security field regarding users

520
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,360
we hear about creating the human

521
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,080
firewall i mean regular firewalls suck

522
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,760
what do we want a human want

523
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,480
i mean get a grip on that and then your

524
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,720
users as the last line of defense if

525
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,799
your users your last line of defense you

526
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,200
failed as a security professional

527
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,280
and why is that specifically because

528
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,039
you have to account what happens if the

529
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,679
user is outright malicious

530
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,240
you know if you and and three percent of

531
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,640
users will be malicious if given the

532
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,840
opportunity

533
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,760
that's just the statistics on the

534
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,960
average number of

535
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,000
sociopaths or psychopaths three to five

536
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,160
percent so at least three percent of

537
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,520
your users will cause

538
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,640
harm if given the opportunity and if you

539
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,320
make them the last line of defense which

540
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,000
they should never be anyway

541
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,080
but even especially in the hands of a

542
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,919
malicious person you have failed as a

543
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,440
security professional

544
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,840
and frankly all this goes down to the

545
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,240
focus on the proximity of the error

546
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,480
they think if they fix the proximity of

547
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,400
the error you don't have to worry about

548
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,720
how the error occurred and how the error

549
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,880
was allowed to proliferate

550
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,280
and that's the big problem here i have

551
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,480
newman

552
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,320
hopefully you all know who newman is

553
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
even if you don't in this case

554
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,160
kind of irrelevant because all i'm doing

555
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,799
is i needed a picture to show accounting

556
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,080
instead of just having the word

557
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,480
accounting in this case then the reason

558
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:26,880
i

559
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,039
do accounting is just imagine what would

560
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,440
happen if the cfo walked into a board

561
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,240
meeting

562
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,679
and said you know what we just had a 20

563
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,280
million dollar error but that was

564
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,440
because of a user and users are

565
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
inherently flawed and you can't blame

566
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,400
the user

567
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,080
you can't blame me because i'm given

568
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,760
inherently flawed systems

569
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,080
that cfo would be fired before the end

570
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,120
of the meeting

571
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,400
why because it's the cfo's job to

572
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,440
properly manage financial resources

573
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,080
and there is the realization that users

574
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,799
are

575
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,039
critical throughout the financial

576
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,080
processes

577
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,640
you can't go ahead and say gee my cred

578
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,600
the users

579
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,799
made a mistake so it's not my fault no

580
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,200
the critical part is you know for

581
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,000
example

582
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,720
how many of you work in an organization

583
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,200
where

584
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,799
if you don't fill out a time card you

585
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,720
don't get paid it's a given

586
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,960
if your organization requires time cards

587
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,080
or the equivalent

588
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,480
and you don't properly fill it out you

589
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,000
will not get paid

590
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,799
and nobody ever says oh that's so unfair

591
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,120
likewise i tell the story a lot but

592
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,880
there was one time where i was traveling

593
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,320
and the people i were

594
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,880
reporting to they wanted me to fill out

595
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,799
travel vouchers why

596
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,440
because that was their financial process

597
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,080
to ensure

598
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,240
nobody abuses travel reimbursement

599
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,320
so i had to fill out the travel voucher

600
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,080
i had to also go ahead and submit

601
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,799
receipts for

602
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,640
each and everything including a 4.63

603
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,840
frappuccino so i had a 3 000

604
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,520
plus travel voucher rejected

605
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,320
because i went ahead and forgot a 4.63

606
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,360
receipt for a frappuccino and they

607
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,520
didn't care that i still provided

608
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,559
a 3 000 hotel bill thousand dollar

609
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,400
airfare whatever it was

610
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,799
you know if i didn't have everything i

611
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,080
didn't get paid

612
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,240
or i didn't get reimbursed and nobody

613
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,200
said oh

614
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,840
we're so unfair they just went ahead and

615
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,960
required it because

616
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,200
that's what we require that's what they

617
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,000
required

618
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,280
of people to get reimbursed here's

619
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,360
um a lot of people don't know but i'm

620
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,200
certified as a master scuba diver

621
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,159
trainer

622
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,480
and in this case here's a picture of a

623
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,200
class

624
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,440
um you know small class getting

625
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,200
certified for open water

626
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,280
and the way i know this is the scuba

627
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,960
instructor would be the person in the

628
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,919
bottom

629
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,480
right corner that person is watching the

630
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,840
person to the left

631
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,760
trying to do a neutral buoyancy

632
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,919
basically hover

633
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,559
slightly do a fin pivot as they call it

634
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,320
where they put the weight on the fins

635
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,559
and go up and down as they breathe

636
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,679
now i first heard the term you can't

637
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,440
c-a-n-t stop stupid when i was taking

638
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,360
scuba instructor my school instructor

639
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,120
course the course director said you

640
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,799
can't stop stupid

641
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,240
and i'm sitting here thinking you know

642
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,480
what our whole course is about

643
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,240
stopping stupid you know we before

644
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,000
users get in the water we give them

645
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
hundreds of hours or dozens of hours of

646
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,799
training

647
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,039
you know now it's all online they have

648
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,320
to take a test

649
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,080
then when they pass the test they come

650
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,360
to a dive school

651
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,120
then the dive school at their smart

652
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,360
gives them another test in person

653
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,120
just in case they had a somebody else

654
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,720
take the test for them

655
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,720
and then once they do that they're like

656
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,880
okay you seem like you know enough

657
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,480
then they start they check all the

658
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,919
equipment they

659
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,080
go ahead and then put them in the water

660
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,760
and see if they can float for a period

661
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,559
of time

662
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,640
and do some basic swimming do they

663
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,960
really care how well they swim no it's

664
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,799
really just a test to make sure

665
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,360
that they don't freak out in the water

666
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,440
then once that's done they put them in a

667
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:05,840
like

668
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,159
the shallow end of a pool and make sure

669
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,919
they could put their head underwater

670
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,760
and then slowly bring them down to the

671
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,720
deep end and get familiar and do skills

672
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,480
when once they're familiar and do the

673
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,159
skills and we're comfortable with the

674
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:18,880
students

675
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,799
we bring them to an open water area

676
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,799
that's not going to be more than 30 feet

677
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,280
deep

678
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,200
because it's hard to kill yourself in 30

679
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,320
feet of water

680
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,559
and but still the dive platforms like

681
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,400
you see on the screen are probably about

682
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,320
15 to 20 feet deep

683
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,720
usually at the you know at the at the

684
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,840
lowest because

685
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,799
again dive instructors want to be safe

686
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:39,520
so anyway

687
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
even when you see all these people and

688
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,200
we check their equipment

689
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
you know the facilities we bring them to

690
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,320
have insurance our

691
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,320
dive school has insurance the instructor

692
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,360
has insurance

693
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,520
we even take out a small medical policy

694
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,120
on the students when they get in the

695
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,799
water and everything like that

696
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,559
that they usually don't know about just

697
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,240
in case we know where the medical

698
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,840
equipment is we know the closest

699
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,640
hospital

700
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,159
we know how to call kits we have 911

701
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,080
kits and so on and i go into that and

702
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,960
yet still

703
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,200
here's one instructor looking at one

704
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,520
student and as you can see it's hard to

705
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,120
see everything going on

706
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,240
but a smart instructor brings

707
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,520
the dive they bring like in the back

708
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,039
you see there there's an assistant

709
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,720
instructor or dive master

710
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,480
that watches the class while the

711
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,080
instructor looks at people

712
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,000
and when i certify people i always try

713
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,760
to bring somebody with me to make sure

714
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,120
nobody does anything

715
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,080
quote unquote stupid while i'm not able

716
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,360
to pay attention

717
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,080
but anyway and then statistically all of

718
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,480
this makes diving safer than bowling and

719
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,840
that's a true fact

720
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,600
i don't know where i heard it from but

721
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,919
again it has never been proven false to

722
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:48,640
me

723
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
so where does the blame fall when

724
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,919
somebody ends up

725
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,080
injuring themselves or a user causes

726
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,360
damage

727
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,640
when you look at everything from a

728
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,720
safety science perspective

729
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,760
90 percent of an injury 90 percent of

730
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,919
accidents happen because of the

731
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,120
environment

732
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,440
only 10 percent happens because of it

733
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,880
specifically due to

734
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,240
a user action and giving you an example

735
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
i was once doing an awareness program

736
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,720
for

737
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,919
a manufacturing organization and we were

738
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,919
walking through the warehouses

739
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,080
and as we were doing this i was given

740
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,760
the tour by the safety manager and the

741
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,679
safety manager points to these yellow

742
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,480
lines down the middle of the

743
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,559
warehouse floor and he's like well you

744
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,400
see these lines we just put them in

745
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,000
about three months ago

746
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,840
because we had a series of accidents

747
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,039
where forklifts were driving into people

748
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,200
and you know we did a whole bunch of

749
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,640
different studies and at the end of the

750
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,000
day we said we're just going to draw a

751
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,080
line and say forklift stay to one side

752
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,919
people stay to the other

753
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,640
and incidents pretty much went away now

754
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,000
the only incidents we have are due to

755
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,880
users or people being on their cell

756
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880
phones and walking across the yellow

757
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,279
line

758
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,840
accidentally just drifting over or

759
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,679
similarly

760
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,440
forklift drivers you know being on their

761
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
cell phone and not paying attention

762
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,640
so those type of things happen but again

763
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,159
ninety percent of the incidents are a

764
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,159
result of it let's see went the wrong

765
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,039
way

766
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,679
anyway so what is that other ten percent

767
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,360
you know what is the ten percent that's

768
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,440
the user's fault carelessness

769
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,679
in other words they they are aware they

770
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,360
just aren't paying attention to what

771
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,159
they're doing

772
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,840
because you can be aware and just not

773
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,159
pay attention you might have blatant

774
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,000
ignorance where you're put in a position

775
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,080
of being completely unknowing

776
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,400
what you're supposed to do lack of

777
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,799
training in the case of the 737 max

778
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,000
jet pilots who basically were all

779
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,159
good pilots who were put in a bad

780
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,120
situation

781
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,200
with a lack of training and then there's

782
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,520
also the outright malice in other words

783
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,600
the people who are just going to do bad

784
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,159
things

785
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,919
because they were given the opportunity

786
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,320
to do so now at a high level this is

787
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:56,720
where

788
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,080
your awareness program fits in you know

789
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,080
where you can go ahead and try to get

790
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,600
people to behave

791
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,919
more diligently and so on and do the

792
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:06,960
right things

793
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,039
now but still that's only ten percent of

794
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,159
the problem

795
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,039
now the other aspect is awareness itself

796
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:13,600
is only

797
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,679
twenty percent of that ten percent so

798
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,320
really only two percent of a solution to

799
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,360
the problem

800
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,039
and this slide represents applied

801
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,399
behavioral science

802
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,720
in applied behavioral science there is

803
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,200
the abcs to make it simple

804
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,440
a is antecedent antecedent is

805
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,520
essentially information you provide

806
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,320
that's supposed to

807
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,960
influence a behavior the behavior is

808
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,440
then

809
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,559
exhibited or a behavior is exhibited

810
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,440
and a behavior generates a consequence

811
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,880
the consequence

812
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
then goes ahead and influences the

813
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,120
behavior so for example if you put your

814
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,279
hand on a flame

815
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,240
and you get burned the consequence burp

816
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,559
being burned will

817
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,240
cause you to avoid the behavior in the

818
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,360
future on the other hand let's say again

819
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,440
a server comes over in a restaurant

820
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,960
tells you the plate's hot

821
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,000
you're like grab the plate anyway either

822
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,919
accidentally or you're like me and just

823
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,600
being obnoxious grab the plate because

824
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,799
hey i'm a man

825
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,279
i can handle it but if i burn my hand

826
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,799
okay you were right

827
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,440
you put down all the plates that follow

828
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,880
on the other hand

829
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,039
if i don't burn my hands and the plates

830
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,720
aren't as hot as they were build in the

831
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,159
first place i should figure

832
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,720
hey maybe the food hasn't been kept warm

833
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,919
appropriately

834
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,919
but either way i'm gonna say hey the

835
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,760
server gave me bad information

836
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,000
those plates aren't really hot so i'm

837
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,320
more inclined to grab the plate the next

838
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:36,799
time

839
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,720
and even when i go to another restaurant

840
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,640
i'm still more inclined to grab the

841
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,640
plate away from the server

842
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,399
and that's essentially what happens in

843
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,679
cyber security

844
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,600
you know we keep telling our users for

845
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,840
example don't reuse your personal

846
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,919
passwords on business accounts and vice

847
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,039
versa

848
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,360
and what happens we tell them that but

849
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,640
they're like hey you know what

850
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,039
i don't want to learn a new password i'm

851
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,039
going to reuse my password

852
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,919
what's the consequence for that 99.99

853
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,480
of the time there is no consequence the

854
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,640
only time i know i can demonstrate a

855
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,480
consequence in the recent past

856
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,679
for example was when people were reusing

857
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,320
their

858
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,000
um you know people obviously have user i

859
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,640
have their email as their user id and

860
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,600
password

861
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,679
and what happened was periodically you

862
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,039
can go to a site like you know you've

863
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,159
been phoned

864
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,480
and see which email addresses have been

865
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,960
compromised the dark web has whole

866
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,679
libraries of them you know email

867
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,200
addresses and passwords that have been

868
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,360
compromised from countless sites

869
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,760
and bad people went ahead and decide hey

870
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,880
let's see if i

871
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,520
take those email addresses and passwords

872
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,960
and attempt to just

873
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,440
stuff them into the ring system you know

874
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,520
ring the home camera systems

875
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,679
and people just took it stuffed it into

876
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:54,799
the ring system

877
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,799
and every so often they came up with

878
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,880
success where people reuse their email

879
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,480
addresses and passwords

880
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,559
on the compromise accounts on their ring

881
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,559
accounts and then you had the cases that

882
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,399
made the news where people were able to

883
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,600
log on to

884
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,679
people's home cameras and talk to their

885
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,360
kids insult the kids

886
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,240
be pornographic and so on and that

887
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,760
happened and those are the only

888
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,600
consequences we can point to but

889
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,679
tell that to your users because they

890
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,520
don't usually hear those things

891
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,760
let's also figure out how to apply this

892
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,440
strategically

893
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,039
and to apply strategically i use the

894
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,200
the concept of boom boom is a counter

895
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,159
terrorism

896
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,840
type of concept and you have the

897
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,159
principal left the boom and write a boom

898
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,240
in cyber security every so often you

899
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,200
hear somebody say

900
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,880
you know we need to move more to the

901
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,360
left be more to the left means you're

902
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,200
going to try to prevent the attack from

903
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,919
occurring

904
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,919
as opposed to moving to the right which

905
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,360
means be reactive

906
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,880
i'll be upfront with you sometimes you

907
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,799
want to be right because it's not cost

908
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,240
effective to move left

909
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,200
but either way that's the principle and

910
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:57,840
what is

911
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,159
really you know going down deeper

912
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,080
prevention in other words if you think

913
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,559
there's a terrorist attack under a car

914
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,840
you know you're going ahead and

915
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
unfortunately given today

916
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,919
you know you have people monitoring like

917
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,679
you know the militias the extremist

918
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,440
groups who are looking to

919
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,200
unfortunately like in pennsylvania they

920
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,960
were going to attack the

921
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,559
ballot counting places at the

922
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,559
philadelphia convention center

923
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,559
but they were on these websites

924
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,120
monitoring extremist groups to go ahead

925
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,919
and figure out hey these people are

926
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,440
potentially going to do something let's

927
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,240
watch them

928
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,679
and then we're going to interdict them

929
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,000
when the opportunity occurs

930
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,960
then protection i mean and i hate to use

931
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,840
today again but

932
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,320
polling places in arizona pennsylvania

933
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,360
and elsewhere

934
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,679
they put police in front of those places

935
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:44,960
to go ahead

936
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,720
and to monitor and protect those people

937
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,919
so that's the protection then we have

938
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,120
the point of boom

939
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,200
in boom this is where for example on

940
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,519
airlines we have hardened cockpit doors

941
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,720
as an example

942
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,159
we have bomb or blast resistant cargo

943
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,840
holds and things like that so if there

944
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,480
is a bomb

945
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,640
and that goes off you know the plane

946
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,080
will ideally not

947
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,960
have a big hole in it and crash so again

948
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,640
you figure out at the point of boom how

949
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,000
do you protect things

950
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,600
and then you have your response so if

951
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,120
there is some sort of

952
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,039
you know issue that you have the first

953
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,279
responders they know how to respond

954
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,320
appropriately

955
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,960
such as looking for example making sure

956
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,480
they know how to look for secondary

957
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,519
explosions

958
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,120
making sure they know how to get to

959
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,039
places have the right equipment and so

960
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:31,679
on

961
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,440
you then have to go ahead and figure out

962
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,480
hey here's this now do we have hospitals

963
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,919
do we have enough hospitals who are

964
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,440
trained and prepared

965
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,919
and then also simultaneously you know do

966
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,240
we know how to like evacuate a city or

967
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,440
simultaneously

968
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,200
do we know how to shut the city down to

969
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
prevent bad people from getting out and

970
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,919
so on

971
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,399
but counter terrorism strategy and you

972
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,559
have different people usually involved

973
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,880
in different phases so different people

974
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,120
are involved in monitoring different

975
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,000
groups of people

976
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,679
different people are involved in

977
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,360
protecting

978
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,919
facilities and so on different people

979
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,760
are involved in responses and

980
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,200
so on and unfortunately in cyber

981
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,440
security usually it's just

982
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,840
you and you know just keep that in mind

983
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,600
now i also want to introduce the concept

984
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,720
to many of you of user initiated loss

985
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,760
because much like you know the stupid

986
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,320
user a user ruining your network a user

987
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,799
your

988
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,240
here's the issue a user doesn't ruin

989
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,600
your network

990
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,960
a user just initiates an action

991
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,399
that can result in loss if you allow the

992
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,720
the environment that allows the user

993
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,000
action to actually

994
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,360
cause damage if for example a user

995
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,440
clicks on a phishing message

996
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,600
and they don't have admin privileges a

997
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,799
lot of malware

998
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,760
will not be able to install ransomware

999
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,080
will generally not be able to install

1000
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,679
if users do not have the ability to load

1001
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,880
software onto a given system so that's

1002
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,240
just one example

1003
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,079
but also you have to realize that the

1004
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,000
user clicks on something

1005
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,599
you facilitated that malicious email to

1006
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,000
be

1007
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,359
in the user's inbox so that again is

1008
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,239
on you so you've got to realize that you

1009
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,359
essentially

1010
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,679
want to go ahead and stop the user from

1011
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,359
being in the position where they can

1012
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,000
initiate

1013
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,040
loss but then likewise acknowledge

1014
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,760
they will at some point initiate loss

1015
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,679
for whatever reason

1016
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,399
now it's up to you proactively to say

1017
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,839
what are the potential

1018
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,239
damages a user can do what are the

1019
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,918
cascading effects

1020
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,800
of a user action and how can i mitigate

1021
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,679
those

1022
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,599
cascading effects from causing damage

1023
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,918
now let's talk left to boom in other

1024
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,760
words how do we prevent the user from

1025
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,520
being in a position to initiate

1026
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,839
loss now clearly there are many

1027
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,680
different types of losses

1028
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,400
in the ideal situation you want to

1029
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,079
possibly take a user

1030
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,280
out of the position to be in the whole

1031
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,560
chain of events

1032
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,160
so for example um let's say you go ahead

1033
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,880
and you just

1034
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,839
like have one of the problems are users

1035
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:16,560
sometimes

1036
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,200
opening up um what's the what are they

1037
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,079
invoices

1038
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,040
yes invoices and when those users open

1039
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,560
up an invoice in the accounting

1040
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,520
department

1041
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,359
you know it could contain malware and

1042
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,440
that happens sometimes well a lot of

1043
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,760
companies put in place these systems

1044
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,400
that automatically receive invoices

1045
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,480
and those systems that receive it filter

1046
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,800
out malware so it doesn't happen

1047
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,640
so essentially in that way you're taking

1048
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,800
the user out of the decision chain to

1049
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,440
open up for example an email attachment

1050
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,400
such as an invoice that's one case but

1051
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,160
either way

1052
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,240
try to take the user out of the decision

1053
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,880
process but simultaneously

1054
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,680
try to filter out a tax if you can't so

1055
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,760
for example with email messages with

1056
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,839
potential phishing messages

1057
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,079
if you have for example dmarc that's

1058
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,920
going to filter out some messages that

1059
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,280
might be malicious

1060
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,680
if you have email servers that have

1061
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,599
anti-malware on it that should filter

1062
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,960
out ransomware

1063
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,119
anti-phishing might filter out some sort

1064
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,280
of scam emails as well

1065
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,880
so again you're trying to create this

1066
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,640
environment that filters it out because

1067
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,560
if the user clicks on the message

1068
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,640
you have failed your system has failed

1069
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,079
because the user

1070
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,560
has an attack in their hands that should

1071
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,680
not happen

1072
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,359
so you want to also create a strong

1073
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,440
security culture and what i mean by that

1074
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:33,839
is

1075
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,040
i use the example when i was at nsa

1076
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,680
i once went ahead and was working shift

1077
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,560
work

1078
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,440
and i had to do something on a plotter

1079
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,119
where they had a

1080
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,520
mechanical arm that moved back and forth

1081
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,520
and when i was working on that i had to

1082
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,520
take my badge off so my badge didn't get

1083
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,520
caught in the mechanical arm

1084
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,280
and one day i went to run out to the

1085
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,200
restroom and i was like

1086
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,920
you know ran back and then i couldn't

1087
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,040
find the badge

1088
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,280
because i forgot to put it back on and

1089
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,040
then i'm looking for it and finally my

1090
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,000
co-worker

1091
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
sarcastically goes are you looking for

1092
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,040
something ira

1093
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,440
i'm like where's that damn badge and

1094
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,280
he's just laughing and everything do you

1095
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,440
think i ever forgot that badge again

1096
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,680
of course not the culture was

1097
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,079
reinforcing the whole wearing of the

1098
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,440
badge

1099
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,680
that's just one example but you want to

1100
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,480
have a culture

1101
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,280
creating people doing the right things

1102
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,760
the key

1103
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,520
thing though is governance and this is

1104
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
where a lot of security professionals

1105
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,160
fail

1106
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,920
we look at governance as a set of

1107
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,680
documents that's required because

1108
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,280
somebody requires them

1109
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,119
and somebody writes up those documents

1110
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,880
and they sit on the shelf

1111
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,200
governance policies proceed especially

1112
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,960
procedures and guidelines should be

1113
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,480
living documents

1114
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,359
those documents should be processes that

1115
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,079
people

1116
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,119
have to follow consistently

1117
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,839
and you should look at your governance

1118
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:56,400
and say

1119
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,960
are we essentially putting the right

1120
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,839
procedures

1121
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,160
in place that says how a user is to do

1122
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,119
their job

1123
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,640
and exactly what actions do they take

1124
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,880
how do they make decisions and the

1125
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,920
decisions are

1126
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,760
probably the most critical part i'll

1127
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,040
talk about that later

1128
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,880
but frequently we don't define

1129
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,960
governance we just slap together

1130
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,359
a bunch of technologies and say hey

1131
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,240
there we go

1132
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,320
and the user is just supposed to do what

1133
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,880
they do their first day of training

1134
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,000
at the point to boom this is where the

1135
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,640
user has the opportunity now and

1136
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,880
unfortunately in cyber security

1137
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,640
especially awareness people they

1138
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,960
fail to recognize the importance of user

1139
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,320
experience

1140
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,640
user experience should drive most of

1141
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,320
user actions in other words you should

1142
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,000
be guiding people

1143
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,240
how they should do their job properly

1144
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,320
couple of examples include well one

1145
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,240
example at least includes

1146
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,400
how you know tagging a message as an

1147
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,320
external message this way if a bad

1148
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:56,880
person

1149
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,280
sends a phishing message says i'm the

1150
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,800
ceo do this

1151
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,880
yeah at least you know the user should

1152
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,839
know it's coming from

1153
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,760
outside the organization so that's

1154
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,160
guiding people to do the right things

1155
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,480
you know not for example if a user goes

1156
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,280
to attach

1157
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,599
you know a sensitive file to an email

1158
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,520
again the user experience should say hey

1159
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,960
you shouldn't be doing this you

1160
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,320
shouldn't be attaching

1161
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,400
sensitive information to a message going

1162
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,839
outside the company

1163
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,760
but then this is also where awareness

1164
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,280
kicks into play

1165
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,760
and at this point people should have the

1166
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,000
ability or the training to say

1167
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,560
here's what my process is you know how

1168
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,440
do i go ahead and do my job

1169
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,240
now this is where i really especially

1170
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,040
beat up

1171
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,400
the awareness people because generally

1172
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,720
what you should be doing is you should

1173
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,240
not be going ahead and saying

1174
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,480
you need to be afraid of these people a

1175
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,280
hacker will

1176
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,079
call you up and try to trick you into

1177
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,400
asking for your password

1178
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,079
you know we shouldn't be training it's

1179
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,720
like hackers will try to do bad things

1180
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,800
you should be saying here's you never

1181
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,760
ever give out a password for any reason

1182
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,440
that's a policy it doesn't matter who

1183
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,960
calls you up it doesn't matter why

1184
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,079
they're calling you up

1185
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,319
you never ever give out your password to

1186
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,319
anyone for any reason

1187
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,240
we are essentially training in cyber

1188
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,920
security we're essentially training

1189
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,680
elmer fudds and hopefully you know who

1190
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,000
elmer fudd is or i hate you

1191
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,920
elmer fudd was always on the lookout for

1192
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,000
the wastely web at bugs bunny he

1193
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,240
wanted to hunt bugs bunny and he was

1194
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,000
always looking for somebody with

1195
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,480
you know that was naked with big pointy

1196
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,040
ears

1197
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,680
if bugs bunny ever put on a dress elmer

1198
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,280
fudd could not recognize

1199
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,960
bugs bunny it was that pathetic but that

1200
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,760
is how we are raising our users we're

1201
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,680
training our users to be on the lookout

1202
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,640
for the wasco

1203
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,119
hacker as opposed to telling them here's

1204
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,240
how to do your job

1205
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,000
right that's a critical failing of us

1206
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,160
so anyway write a boom a loss has been

1207
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,240
initiated you need to design

1208
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,520
an environment that expects a user to do

1209
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,720
something that might result in harm

1210
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,720
and that means that yes somebody should

1211
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,880
be out there saying not just random like

1212
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,720
what are counter measures i need random

1213
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,760
counter measures

1214
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,200
they should be sitting there and saying

1215
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,240
okay what are the abilities users

1216
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,200
have and how do i need to potentially

1217
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,800
limit those actions

1218
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,119
how do i potentially limit those that

1219
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,880
the harm the source of the

1220
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,160
of the source of loss and you should be

1221
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,119
again

1222
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,240
doing an analysis of user initiated loss

1223
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,240
now at the same time you need to much

1224
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,760
like the medical profession and

1225
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,480
everything

1226
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,800
after there is an incident go back and

1227
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,800
analyze the incident figure out why it

1228
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,599
occurred

1229
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,520
you know what caused it what's enabled

1230
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,280
it you know and frankly look at where

1231
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,839
you got lucky sometimes because

1232
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,599
some incidents i've been on incidents

1233
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,119
where you know what

1234
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,680
one time and this was actually the case

1235
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,040
of the

1236
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,200
uh what was the virus that just came out

1237
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,160
that maersk if you read wired magazine

1238
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,319
mass the big shipping people they there

1239
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,440
was like the uh

1240
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,240
eternal blue vulnerability one of the

1241
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,359
nsa

1242
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,599
leaked vulnerabilities that a lot of

1243
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,319
wannacry for example i think it was

1244
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,680
maris shipping which is a multi-billion

1245
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,359
dollar multi multi-billion dollar

1246
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,240
company

1247
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,960
their whole network was taken down the

1248
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,040
only thing that was their saving grace

1249
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,000
was there was

1250
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,359
an outage in an african country

1251
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,480
that had a uh an incredibly unreliable

1252
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,079
connection to begin with

1253
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,240
and if it wasn't for that connection

1254
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,480
being unreliable in out

1255
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,319
they would have been totally screwed but

1256
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,400
they essentially reconstituted their

1257
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,280
whole dns

1258
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,400
infrastructure because one

1259
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,040
system was protected because of an

1260
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,839
accidental

1261
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,319
outage and you need to figure out

1262
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:49,359
similar things

1263
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,800
how where and how did you get lucky

1264
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,960
so anyway it sounds difficult but as i

1265
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,079
mentioned previously

1266
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,000
safety science looks at where losses

1267
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,599
come from accounting looks at where

1268
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,160
losses come from operations does this

1269
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,800
that's the whole six sigma total quality

1270
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,480
management or whatever the quality

1271
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,560
buzzwords are today

1272
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,680
and everybody does this now consider if

1273
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,400
90

1274
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,720
of loss results from a user-initiated

1275
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,520
loss again

1276
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,040
the verizon dbir all significant studies

1277
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,359
show

1278
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:23,119
90 of all significant losses occur

1279
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,520
with the user as the primary attack

1280
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,480
vector

1281
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,960
and frankly if you can go ahead and

1282
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,040
figure the user will be the primary

1283
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,400
attack vector

1284
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,800
and mitigate the 90 percent of incidents

1285
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,480
you're going to get the other 10 percent

1286
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,880
of incidents as well

1287
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,040
let's talk about how this might be you

1288
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,119
know all of you your security west

1289
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,200
virginia let's assume you're all

1290
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,200
you know in the u.s you know what w-2

1291
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,400
forms are

1292
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,599
so every year there's thousands of w-2

1293
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,119
attacks that happen and

1294
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,079
successful w-2 attacks where somebody

1295
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,480
essentially finds a low-level hr person

1296
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,520
on linkedin

1297
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,400
they send a message saying i'm the ceo

1298
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,280
and

1299
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,000
i we just hired a new accounting firm i

1300
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,160
need you to send all the w-2

1301
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,960
raw w-2 information out to our new

1302
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,800
accounting firm who will then process

1303
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,960
the w-2 forms

1304
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,280
always happens so what could

1305
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,760
theoretically stop this from a start to

1306
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,760
finish using you know the concept of

1307
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,400
boom

1308
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,880
first we look left to boom we do mail

1309
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,760
filtering we tag messages as external

1310
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,599
we go ahead maybe we want to go ahead

1311
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,839
and tell people not to be so robust on

1312
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,319
their linkedin profiles as an example

1313
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,160
so the attackers know who to send these

1314
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,520
attacks to

1315
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,520
but then at the point to boom here's the

1316
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,560
biggest thing

1317
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,480
besides of the tagging besides of the

1318
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,079
user experience

1319
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,119
we tell users you know what i don't

1320
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,520
care who's asking you for w-2

1321
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,040
information which is essentially

1322
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,400
pii what we're doing is if you we are

1323
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,920
going to release pii

1324
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,160
you as a low-level user are not allowed

1325
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,920
to release pii

1326
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,240
any requests for pii have to go through

1327
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,599
the head of hr

1328
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,599
and the head of hr has to release it

1329
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,440
only with the approval for example of

1330
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,520
the general counsel

1331
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,480
and that's just one example and so you

1332
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,480
go ahead and the low-level user should

1333
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,599
say hey

1334
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,079
this says it's from the ceo i've been

1335
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:18,800
told

1336
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,800
i'm not supposed to do it even if it is

1337
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,800
from the ceo i'm just going to send the

1338
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,800
information to the head of hr

1339
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,599
which i do and that and it's out of my

1340
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,400
hands

1341
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,480
and your awareness program should be

1342
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,000
training and how to handle

1343
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,200
pii not what to be afraid of not every

1344
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,359
little trick a hacker might do

1345
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,520
and then anyway so you assume that the

1346
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,880
user forwards it on

1347
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,800
but even if the user doesn't forward it

1348
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,960
on or even if the hacker theoretically

1349
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,000
tricks

1350
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,800
the head of hr there should be warnings

1351
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,920
of attaching

1352
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,040
pii to a file destined for an external

1353
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:53,920
system

1354
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,000
that's number one and then data leak

1355
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,440
prevention software

1356
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,760
should also filter out the message even

1357
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,839
if the user ignores the warning to get

1358
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,040
the message out

1359
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,119
and stops the message from going out so

1360
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,960
again here you should see

1361
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,880
your user is not your last line of

1362
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,800
defense you should have technologies as

1363
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,640
your last line of defense

1364
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,599
now the overlap again handling a pii in

1365
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:16,960
the case of w-2

1366
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,400
for w-c-e-o fraud w-2 fraud stops

1367
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,839
all releases of pii in general data leak

1368
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,280
prevention stops a

1369
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,920
variety of attacks filtering of incoming

1370
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,640
emails from malware fishing and so on

1371
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,119
again stops a variety of attacks warning

1372
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,480
of attachments again

1373
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,280
a variety of attacks are stopped you

1374
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,480
know i already said this

1375
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,280
but if you can mitigate 90 by focusing

1376
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,760
on user-initiated loss you should get

1377
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,640
the other 10

1378
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,119
as well here's the thing people hear me

1379
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,079
say this and they say

1380
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,000
oh you're saying i don't need to waste

1381
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,079
money on awareness awareness first off

1382
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,599
is not a waste of money

1383
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,319
awareness is still mandatory because for

1384
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:57,520
a user

1385
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,440
to actually be able to click on a

1386
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,560
phishing message meant

1387
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,760
your whole technology infrastructure in

1388
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,079
filtering out emails has failed at that

1389
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:06,720
point

1390
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,839
so that's number one number two once we

1391
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:10,640
filtered out

1392
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,319
all that you know now we do need users

1393
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,280
to let us know

1394
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,680
that things have failed and send let

1395
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,440
people know that there's a tax

1396
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,400
in progress because your attacks failed

1397
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,559
to allow the user to get the message

1398
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,400
and you're or sorry the technology

1399
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,400
failed to allow the mail to get to the

1400
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:28,960
user

1401
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,440
and technology might fail after the user

1402
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,640
might do something

1403
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,760
so you do need a user to be aware

1404
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,280
and you know frankly you don't spend

1405
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,359
that much on awareness to begin with

1406
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,599
most people don't spend enough money so

1407
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,200
you're not really you're getting a

1408
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,119
fairly good return on investment

1409
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,119
every time a user doesn't open up their

1410
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,040
spam file and open all the messages

1411
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,200
it's a success you're not counting all

1412
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,640
the successes that you have because

1413
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,400
they're not as obvious

1414
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,680
but anyway awareness has to be however

1415
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,480
not what to be afraid of but how to do

1416
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,920
their job properly

1417
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,760
and that's most critical so again

1418
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,440
the big problem we have in cyber

1419
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,839
security is we tend to throw lots of

1420
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,000
tactics around we throw some technology

1421
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,400
we say okay we'll have an email filter

1422
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,000
maybe we'll have an awareness program

1423
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,440
maybe we'll have dlp

1424
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,280
but you're implementing that as random

1425
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,640
tactics you're not

1426
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,720
implementing that as a comprehensive

1427
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,839
strategy

1428
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,079
again safety science looks at potential

1429
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,760
injuries and says where is the best

1430
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,400
place

1431
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,520
to mitigate these potential injuries and

1432
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,280
it might be before it might be during

1433
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,400
might be after

1434
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,480
likewise in cyber security we need a

1435
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,599
strategy

1436
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,720
for figuring out how we mitigate user

1437
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,160
initiated laws

1438
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,079
and it's not just throwing random

1439
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:45,760
tactics around you need to figure out

1440
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,119
hey wait a second

1441
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,280
maybe we go ahead and maybe we don't put

1442
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,240
prevention

1443
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,400
to stop certain types of attacks maybe

1444
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,880
we expect the user to do the wrong thing

1445
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,960
but at least if we lock the system down

1446
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,800
for example don't give user admin

1447
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,839
privileges

1448
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,920
lock down the most critical data we can

1449
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,480
ease up some controls elsewhere

1450
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,040
but that should be done strategically

1451
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,160
not randomly not by a random decision

1452
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,160
not by a tactical decision but a

1453
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,000
strategy

1454
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,800
the most important takeaway again you're

1455
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,359
not

1456
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,680
you've got to treat your users like the

1457
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,359
canaries in the coal mine

1458
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,599
you don't put a gas mask on a user you

1459
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,440
basically say we're going to try to make

1460
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,240
the user as

1461
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,880
good as possible but we realize they

1462
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,280
will fail and those failures tell us

1463
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,640
where our system

1464
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,559
is otherwise weak and needs to be

1465
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:35,839
improved oh yeah

1466
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,760
everybody sorry even more important

1467
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,200
everybody should buy my new book you

1468
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,319
can't stop stupid

1469
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,599
available on amazon pre-order now and

1470
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:44,559
with that

1471
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,880
i think i am done i don't
