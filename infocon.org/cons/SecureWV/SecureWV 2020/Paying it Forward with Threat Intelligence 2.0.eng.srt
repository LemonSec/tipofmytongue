1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,159
my name is katie schwallen and i'm an

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,080
information security analyst here at

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,920
highmark health and i first joined the

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,720
team

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,240
to help stand up their threat

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,760
intelligence program

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,840
a little bit of background about me i

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,759
actually did not come from information

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,160
security before i got this job

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,199
i had every intentions of moving to dc

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,920
and getting a big shot intelligence

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,720
analyst job at a three-letter agency

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,160
i'm kind of glad things didn't work out

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,840
that way because this has been a super

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,119
rewarding career

16
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,720
i've loved my time in information

17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,880
security and i can't wait to see

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,880
how the threat intelligence landscape

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,520
progresses as we move forward

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,320
so just a quick agenda for today we're

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,680
going to be going over the objective of

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,120
this presentation and what i hope you

23
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,039
guys are going to get out of it

24
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,559
then i'll be defining threat

25
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,399
intelligence and what that definition

26
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,800
looks like to my organization

27
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,640
as well as the elements of a successful

28
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,079
threat intelligence program

29
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,600
and how we've implemented those at

30
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,079
highmark to build our program out

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,239
next i'll be moving into some dark web

32
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,320
visibility which is a fairly

33
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,640
new venture for us here at highmark and

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,479
i'll be talking about how

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,880
that has specifically expanded our

36
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,799
program and allowed us to

37
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,720
really get some great threat

38
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,640
intelligence out of it

39
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,159
and then i'll be moving on to the

40
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,439
importance of threat intelligence

41
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,720
sharing as well as building and

42
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,080
maintaining those intelligence

43
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,200
relationships

44
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,400
i gave this presentation at secure wv

45
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,200
last year so this might look a little

46
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,400
bit familiar to you

47
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,240
but i hope that with the changes i've

48
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,520
made you'll get some

49
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,880
something new out of it and be able to

50
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,479
bring those back to your new to your

51
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,119
organizations

52
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,680
so the objective of this presentation

53
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,840
will be to discuss many of the questions

54
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
surrounding threat intelligence and its

55
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,960
sharing so

56
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,320
exactly what elements make up a

57
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,560
successful threat intelligence program

58
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,560
and then why is visibility into the dark

59
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,399
web so important for threat intelligence

60
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,640
for your organization

61
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,360
and then why it's important to pay pay

62
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,719
it forward with threat intelligence

63
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,040
hence the title of this presentation

64
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,799
as well as how do organizations seek out

65
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,560
intelligent sharing relationships

66
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,840
and how do you maintain these

67
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,440
relationships and mature them

68
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,160
so defining threat intelligence um so as

69
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,120
you can see at the top

70
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,760
there's a pretty big long-winded

71
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,560
definition

72
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,720
of what threat intelligence is and this

73
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,800
one is in particular is by gartner

74
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,599
i'm not going to read it but what i

75
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,120
encourage all of you to do

76
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,080
whether you already have a laid out

77
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,200
pretty successful

78
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,480
and functioning threat intelligence

79
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,920
program or if you're just dipping your

80
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,760
toes into it is consider

81
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,000
what that definition looks like to you

82
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,040
and your organization

83
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,400
it's going to be different for everybody

84
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,319
depending on your size

85
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,840
what your environment looks like what

86
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,239
tools you have how many analysts you

87
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,599
have and what resources are at your

88
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,720
disposal

89
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,360
but for highmark it's basically threat

90
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,200
intelligence is information that helps

91
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
organizations prevent attacks

92
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,840
and uh uncharted threats that endanger

93
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,680
their unique environment that's what it

94
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,080
is for

95
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,319
us but it i like i said it's going to be

96
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,040
different for everybody

97
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,720
so now i'll be delving into the elements

98
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,159
of a successful threat intelligence

99
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:08,879
program

100
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,599
and these i believe are some really good

101
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,440
tried and true methods they worked for

102
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,560
us

103
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,120
but take all of these as a suggestion

104
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,640
and try to apply them to your own

105
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,640
organization

106
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,239
so the first would be threat

107
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,239
intelligence impacts other areas besides

108
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,840
security

109
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,080
you know as security professionals we

110
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,920
really do have to sell our value

111
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
sometimes to the organization because we

112
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,720
do cost money we don't make money

113
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,760
however we do prevent the loss of

114
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,959
revenue

115
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,080
a data breach could cause millions and

116
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,840
millions and millions of dollars

117
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,319
for a company to clean up and regain

118
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,400
their reputation after it happens

119
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,440
so the way we frame threat intelligence

120
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,120
as an importance to the business

121
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
is that we prevent those costs from

122
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,319
happening so

123
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,319
we are constantly communicating with our

124
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,159
privacy and legal

125
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,159
departments as well as risk compliance

126
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,680
to really hit home

127
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,319
how important threat intelligence is to

128
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,760
protecting our organization

129
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,599
we also communicate a lot with corporate

130
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,319
physical security marketing finance

131
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,439
and policy to really help them

132
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,358
understand that sometimes their actions

133
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,798
can affect the security of the

134
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,478
organization

135
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,560
so communication with the business is

136
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,240
very very important

137
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,479
as well as helping them to understand

138
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,440
why

139
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,280
security and intelligence is an

140
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,120
important part of the business

141
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,759
um you all and i would argue kind of off

142
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,880
topic that

143
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,880
hiring analysts that have the ability to

144
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,160
communicate with a non-technical

145
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,919
audience like that is a really valuable

146
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:40,960
skill to have

147
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,400
especially if you're working on a threat

148
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,560
intelligence team

149
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
additionally intelligence can increase

150
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,400
visibility into threats the organization

151
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,320
faces as a whole

152
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,520
you know something that i think

153
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,080
mostly our business side employees don't

154
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,120
realize sometimes

155
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,400
is that external emails and the users

156
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,160
themselves actually pose a huge risk to

157
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,840
the organization

158
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,560
so we really do hit home the importance

159
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,400
of phishing training

160
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,800
making sure that you're vetting every

161
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,240
external email that comes into your

162
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,520
inbox because that is

163
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,639
tends to be your weakest link um so

164
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,479
as much intelligence as you can give the

165
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,400
business side the less of chance that

166
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,360
you have of

167
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,720
a compromise from that happening

168
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,120
the second element would be identifying

169
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,520
separate operational and strategic goals

170
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,560
so strategic goals i like to refer to as

171
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,000
soft skills stuff that

172
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,840
your analysts should have in their tool

173
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,840
belt in order to make your security

174
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,440
posture much stronger

175
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,199
those include things like relationship

176
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,639
building whether that be within your

177
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,880
company or outside your company

178
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,039
trend identification when it comes to

179
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,479
reviewing notable events if you're a

180
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,919
stock analyst

181
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,720
adversary attribution which ttps go to

182
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
which adversary and how can you learn to

183
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,000
recognize them in the future

184
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,440
as well as internal assessments and

185
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,360
technical self-evaluations

186
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,199
whereas operational skills i like to

187
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,800
refer to as your hard skills

188
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,759
so technical skills hard numbers data

189
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,520
analytics stuff like that

190
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,039
so that can refer to incident

191
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,960
identification and categorization

192
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,039
defensive controls assigning alerts to

193
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,720
analysts depending on their workload

194
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,160
or tracking and recording key metrics so

195
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,080
the way that you can track each of these

196
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,360
things or manage them

197
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,120
would be for the strategic side of

198
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
performance management console

199
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,360
um for operational use of a soar

200
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,319
platform

201
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,680
if you're not familiar with what a sore

202
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,680
platform is it stands for security

203
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,039
orchestration

204
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,520
um automation and response so by

205
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,039
automating a lot of those

206
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,440
hard skills or things that analysts

207
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,880
don't necessarily want to do every day

208
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,520
like instant

209
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,639
identification and categorization that

210
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,479
can free up a lot of time for you to

211
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,639
spend working on important incidents or

212
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,599
special project work

213
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,160
third would be working partnerships with

214
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,960
larger security organizations

215
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,440
there's a ton of benefits to

216
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,800
intelligence sharing that

217
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,599
i can't possibly all list here but i

218
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,240
think the

219
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,240
best one is knowing about your threats

220
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,680
in real time

221
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,880
i'm gonna switch to hisac for a second

222
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,919
you can see their logo

223
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,039
over on the right side of the screen

224
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,960
hisac is a health information security

225
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,319
uh sharing agency so they have a

226
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,160
email distribution list they have a

227
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,599
private chat room where you can chat

228
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,199
with other members about threats that

229
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,520
they're experiencing in real time

230
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,160
they have a threat intelligence fee that

231
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,759
you can ingest into your sim

232
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,960
platform um so really big benefits to

233
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,039
being part of hisac

234
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,280
there are a bunch of different isacs out

235
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,720
there i know there's one for the finance

236
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,440
industry

237
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,560
i think there's one for critical

238
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,280
infrastructure as well but

239
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
just pick and choose which isac you want

240
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,639
to join

241
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,440
depending on what industry you're in and

242
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,879
they provide a lot of really great

243
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,520
information weekly webinars

244
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,440
trainings conferences stuff like that

245
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,199
which brings me to my next point

246
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,560
incentive benefits like training

247
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,120
admissions conferences etc

248
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,360
and for this one i'll kind of pick on

249
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,520
recorded future so if you haven't heard

250
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,360
of recorded future they are a threat

251
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,120
intelligence platform

252
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,080
they are a paid service and we do use

253
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,560
them

254
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,800
um they are our main source of threat

255
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,680
intelligence

256
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,160
they we ingest a lot of data from them

257
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,680
and actually have alerts set up in the

258
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,199
platform to alert us on various

259
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,960
different things so

260
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,360
for example we have a brand risk thing

261
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,039
set up so if someone is typo squatting

262
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,159
one of our domains

263
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,799
it will alert us we can take action um

264
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,559
but for recorded future they provide a

265
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,279
ton of

266
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,479
a really exclusive training so you can

267
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,360
learn how to use

268
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,519
not only their platform better but

269
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,440
conferences like predict

270
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,800
where they bring in security

271
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,399
professionals from all over the world to

272
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,160
talk about

273
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,560
high pressure situations that they've

274
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,000
been in a security professionals

275
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,519
and hot button topics in the industry

276
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,279
today

277
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,880
and then third that i want to talk about

278
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,320
is helping others in your community with

279
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,560
intel on threats that you've discovered

280
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,839
so um we're part of the western

281
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,240
pennsylvania all hazards fusion center

282
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,800
here at highmark i actually used to

283
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,320
intern with the city of pittsburgh when

284
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,080
i was in grad school

285
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,600
and when i found out about this program

286
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,240
that the fusion center had when i

287
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,519
started working at heinrich i was like

288
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,959
why aren't we part of that because it's

289
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:23,600
a huge

290
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,560
intel sharing community it's essentially

291
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,080
a public-private partnership

292
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,839
with law enforcement private

293
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,279
organizations in the region

294
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,279
as well as all the local governments we

295
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,959
get together once a quarter and we

296
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:35,519
discuss

297
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,120
what threats are going on in the region

298
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,959
whether those be cyber

299
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,440
weather stuff related to critical

300
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,120
infrastructure

301
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,440
anything like that crime the fbi is also

302
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,320
very involved

303
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,240
so it's a really valuable relationship

304
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,440
for us because we get to

305
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,839
get the whole picture of thread intel

306
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,399
rather than just the cyber picture

307
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,839
and those are all connected to each

308
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:56,880
other so it's a really great

309
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
relationship that we have

310
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,040
um a couple other relationships that i

311
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,120
want to mention here are blue intel

312
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,320
so if you're not a healthcare

313
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,079
organization you probably haven't heard

314
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:06,880
of them

315
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,120
but blue intel is an intelligence

316
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,640
organization that serves all of the

317
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,480
blues plans across the nation

318
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,959
they're fairly exclusive if you google

319
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,720
them they won't pop up anywhere

320
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,079
it's literally a bunch of guys sitting

321
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,079
in a basement doing all of this work for

322
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,279
every single blues plan

323
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,640
in the country and because of that

324
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,360
and their exclusive intel it's all very

325
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,040
targeted toward health care

326
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,440
so when we have a really big incident

327
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,240
that happens

328
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,560
like the ryuk incident that happened

329
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,360
last week

330
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,480
if you didn't hear um ryak was attacking

331
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,560
u.s hospitals across the nation

332
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,160
and we were in constant contact with

333
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,320
blue entel to see what the scope of that

334
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,279
threat was

335
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,360
the fbi had sent out a very ominous

336
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,800
notice

337
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,120
wednesday of last week and blue intel

338
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,320
was able to provide us with enough

339
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,920
intelligence to kind of talk us down off

340
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,800
the ledge

341
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,839
let us know that hey if you haven't seen

342
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,279
anything fishy in your environment in

343
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,000
the last week

344
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,560
you probably weren't a target but having

345
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,160
that peace of mind and that intelligence

346
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,839
relationship with them really helped us

347
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:06,240
know

348
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,519
what our risk was for that

349
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,000
and fourth is building profiles of

350
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,360
threat actors

351
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,399
i believe that knowing who your

352
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,320
attackers are and who the attackers are

353
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,079
that you see most often is very valuable

354
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,519
in information

355
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,839
and profiling adversaries through your

356
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,440
threat intelligence allows you to be

357
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,000
much

358
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,240
more prepared for attacks when they do

359
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,600
come

360
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,200
as well as categorization of those

361
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,800
threat actors those are just as

362
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,160
important as building out your profiles

363
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,079
and making sure you have all your ttps

364
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:34,640
in line

365
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,240
making sure all of your iocs for that

366
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,600
thread after are already blocked on your

367
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,320
network

368
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,399
and having a working profile so you can

369
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,839
add to that

370
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,959
as you see that threat actor more often

371
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,120
that threat actor for us is usually emo

372
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,160
tech

373
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,079
we get a lot of phishing emails and our

374
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,680
messaging team is fantastic and does a

375
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,200
really great job of blocking them

376
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,600
most of the time but sometimes they eat

377
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,320
through

378
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,800
and we sometimes get an email compromise

379
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,560
but we know exactly how to deal with

380
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,079
them because we've dealt with them so

381
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,920
often and we have that profile

382
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,000
at the ready when something happens we

383
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,519
know how to identify them the first time

384
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,720
they get onto the network

385
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,120
and we know what to do every time after

386
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,000
that so

387
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,519
it's extremely valuable to have those

388
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,519
profiles already built out so your team

389
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,320
can go

390
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,079
that's it okay we know what to do

391
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,160
so now the fun part i recently

392
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,959
got into doing some dark web research um

393
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:27,839
my mentor

394
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,680
at highmark robert camilla he's on our

395
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
incident response and forensics team

396
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,320
really pushed me to start doing this so

397
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,560
i was able to do some dark web research

398
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,160
for threat intelligence for highmark

399
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,360
and i think it's something that we're

400
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,959
going to be continuing into the future

401
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,639
with the help of our threat intelligence

402
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,160
platform recorded future

403
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,040
to start monitoring um for leaked

404
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,200
proprietary data on the dark web

405
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,920
and using our knowledge of it to get it

406
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,279
off of there

407
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,880
so um i will be up front the reality of

408
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,920
the dark web is not very glamorous

409
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,399
i know it sounds really fun and kind of

410
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,000
like the first image that you see up

411
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,560
there

412
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,440
but it's really not it's more it's a lot

413
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,800
of trial and error with your search

414
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,000
terms i will say

415
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,800
um tons of broken links lots of sites

416
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,600
moved

417
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,639
you're not going to be able to get into

418
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,519
some places the barrier to entry can be

419
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,240
high

420
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,200
so there also really isn't a one-stop

421
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,120
shop for information on the dark web

422
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,920
it tends to be you have to piece things

423
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,240
together so you'll find a really good

424
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,959
piece of intel on one forum but it won't

425
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,160
be the whole picture

426
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,399
and you'll have to kind of search for it

427
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,480
for a couple hours before you really do

428
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:36,800
get

429
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,720
a comprehensive image of what that looks

430
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,160
like um

431
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,320
additionally some forums can require you

432
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,240
to create an account or register to view

433
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,920
content on them

434
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,360
and that can be intimidating for

435
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,959
somebody that doesn't really know how to

436
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,480
navigate the dark web

437
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,320
doesn't have knowledge of what email

438
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,839
services are available to use on the

439
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,040
dark web so

440
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,279
people can't discover your identity

441
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,320
because you certainly don't want to use

442
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,399
a personal email address

443
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,399
so technical knowledge is required to

444
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,440
some degree um

445
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,160
you really won't understand a lot about

446
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,440
accessing the dark web

447
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,920
navigating it or what you see on it if

448
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,360
you don't have some

449
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,320
uh baseline of technical knowledge

450
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,920
and uh now i want to talk about

451
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,839
navigating to dark websites so if you

452
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,519
have never been on the dark web before

453
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,760
anything with a dot onion domain is a

454
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,720
dark website

455
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,959
um not necessarily like bad but it is a

456
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,920
considered on the dark web for a website

457
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,760
and the way you get there is through the

458
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,600
tor browser or the onion browser which

459
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,320
you have to download onto your desktop

460
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,160
highly recommend using a burner laptop

461
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,639
for this along with a virtual machine

462
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,959
i used an ubuntu virtual machine for

463
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,120
this particular project

464
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,639
i'm not going to get into all the

465
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,320
technical details about how to set that

466
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,519
up because

467
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,240
i had a lot of help doing that but if

468
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,079
you're interested there's tons of stuff

469
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,320
out there that can help you

470
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,399
but i used a dark web search engine to

471
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,680
really start

472
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,880
exploring the dark web um duckduckgo is

473
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,920
a stepping stone to that but mia the

474
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,600
screenshot that you see right there

475
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,519
is one that i found that was most

476
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,199
successful in number of search terms

477
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,079
that it gave me

478
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,279
and you didn't have to be super specific

479
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,399
with your search terms

480
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,560
um torch was another one that i found

481
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
but you did have to be more selective

482
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,680
with what you were putting into the

483
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,440
search bar to actually get some results

484
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,320
back

485
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,600
um excuse me the hidden wiki uh is a

486
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
repository of dark web links

487
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,959
that you have for many different

488
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,639
categories and services that you can

489
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,920
find on the dark web

490
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,519
um that's a great starting place but i

491
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,120
will say a lot of the links were broken

492
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,560
by the time i got there they aren't

493
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,000
updated very often so

494
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,040
proceed with caution and uh like i was

495
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,480
saying earlier your search terms do have

496
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,079
to be a little bit more general

497
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,160
so when i first started i was looking

498
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,120
for

499
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,399
emote ttps or ryuk

500
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,720
ransomware that was getting me nowhere

501
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,519
um because

502
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,040
if you think about it those threat

503
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,720
actors aren't going to put out there

504
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,360
that this

505
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,920
is who they are and what kind of malware

506
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,040
that they're making

507
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,480
so looking for something a little bit

508
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,160
more general like malware

509
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,000
or hacking or malware forum is going to

510
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,079
be much more successful and gets you a

511
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,800
lot more places

512
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,839
so this is a screenshot of the tour

513
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,519
links that i was talking about so as you

514
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,399
can see

515
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,720
on the screen there is some commercial

516
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
links at the top um

517
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,240
and then there's some more

518
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,759
non-commercial links so

519
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,759
uh it is the dark web people be careful

520
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,440
where you go

521
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,040
you can run into a lot of crap on there

522
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,480
so just proceed with caution

523
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,279
okay so the outer space blog was one of

524
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,240
the first

525
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,399
blog slash forums that i found when i

526
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,759
was doing this research

527
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,759
um it's written by a self-proclaimed

528
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,120
like gray hacker

529
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,480
um and if you don't know what a gray

530
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,959
hacker is uh it's they sit in between

531
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,360
a white hat and a black hat so they

532
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,959
sometimes

533
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,199
cross that line from morality violate

534
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,959
some laws and ethical standards but

535
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,920
they don't necessarily have the whole

536
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,680
malicious intent of a traditional threat

537
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,199
actor

538
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,480
but i found this to be a really good

539
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,720
resource for finding other hacking

540
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,480
forums so as you can see at the top in

541
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,160
the screenshot he had written a post

542
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,919
recently on hacker forums

543
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,400
so i was able to get to a lot of

544
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,799
different places by using his website

545
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,760
um he also has a really good detailed

546
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,199
walkthrough different types of website

547
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,439
compromises that he's done recently

548
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,839
as well as some malware analysis pieces

549
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,839
and he also reviews some new tactics in

550
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,200
the hacking community as well

551
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,520
so really valuable place for my research

552
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,160
and this one as it suggests was you know

553
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,840
a little bit more on the dark side

554
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,840
it is called the sinisterly forum so

555
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,760
they provided a lot of

556
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,840
threads on hacking from network website

557
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,360
to server

558
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,440
password cracking tacking into people's

559
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,840
social media or emails

560
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,360
however i did find that this one was

561
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,440
fairly exclusive i wasn't able to get

562
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,120
into a lot of the threads

563
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,280
because you have to register and also

564
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,480
pay dues

565
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,600
on this particular forum and i found

566
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,120
that to be a pretty common barrier to

567
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,200
entry on hacking forums it keeps out the

568
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,480
noobs if you will

569
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,000
um so if you're going to dive down this

570
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,720
rabbit hole

571
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,400
keep that in mind if you're actually

572
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,760
going to register on some of these

573
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,280
websites with a

574
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,880
dark web email address if you're

575
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,640
contributing

576
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,160
make sure that you don't reveal too much

577
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,000
about yourself or

578
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,080
sound like you're not exactly up to

579
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,600
snuff with the rest of the people on the

580
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,000
forum they will kick you out

581
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,360
and this seemed to have a pretty active

582
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,120
membership so i was able to get

583
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,640
quite a bit of information out of this

584
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,559
one

585
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,000
what you see now is a screenshot of

586
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,160
someone's question

587
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,160
asking if a skype server was hackable

588
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,679
and i'm just now realizing that the

589
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,080
member

590
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,840
is called hacker con i swear i didn't

591
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,200
plan that

592
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,320
um but i did redact all of the stuff on

593
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,000
here so you can't see what the server

594
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,280
actually looks like but this was a

595
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,280
pretty common thing to see on that forum

596
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,160
like hey

597
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,919
can i actually hack into this or hey can

598
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,720
i get help with this

599
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,720
and this was another post on there as

600
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,720
someone asking for effective methods on

601
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,120
hacking websites for drive-by downloads

602
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,760
and

603
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,799
harvesting database information and

604
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,440
the green icon guy that you see below

605
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,160
that post

606
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,320
i think he was an admin on this account

607
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
um on this particular forum he was

608
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,080
active on every single post

609
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,799
um commenting giving people advice stuff

610
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,840
like that so

611
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,600
like i said very very active membership

612
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,080
on this forum

613
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,240
and the last forum i want to discuss is

614
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,320
the graysec forum

615
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,559
obviously run by gray hats as the name

616
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,679
suggests but

617
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,640
it gave a huge variety of topics as you

618
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,480
can see in the screenshot just like

619
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,160
miscellaneous discussion um but the most

620
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,400
uh interesting ones i found were the

621
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,240
malware development ones and human

622
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,120
manipulation

623
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,679
social engineering um people were also

624
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,640
posting a ton

625
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,520
of resources to download links to their

626
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,880
github repositories

627
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,679
books that they had written white papers

628
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,240
and

629
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,679
video tutorials for some difficult

630
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,640
concepts for people to grasp

631
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,400
this is a screenshot from that malware

632
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,240
development thread

633
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,000
it as you can see it started back in

634
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,520
2017 but

635
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,919
was still so so active when i got on

636
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,280
there in september

637
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,600
and people just adding to it constantly

638
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,760
it had everything from how to reverse

639
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,600
engineer malware to how to analyze it to

640
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,039
how to write your first

641
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,760
little baby malware script really really

642
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,640
fascinating to read through

643
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,640
and this is one from the social

644
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,400
engineering thread

645
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,120
this guy linked a bunch of resources for

646
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,600
books

647
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,200
on how to conduct social engineering

648
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,400
interrogation

649
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,799
um how to conduct how to construct

650
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,919
phishing emails

651
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,720
to get more responses it was just so

652
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,520
cool to read through

653
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,480
so now that we've gone through how to

654
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,760
use the dark web

655
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,840
how exactly do you share that

656
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840
intelligence or what you found

657
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,720
necessarily with your peers um and how

658
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,000
do you even go about making those

659
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,440
relationships to

660
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,039
enter into these kinds of intelligent

661
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,720
sharing networks

662
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,600
so there's a ton of benefits to this you

663
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,120
know you discover vulnerabilities and

664
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,080
data breaches

665
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,000
in real time like i was talking about

666
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,080
those chat rooms with hisac and blue

667
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,280
intel are some of the more

668
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,600
most valuable intelligence relationships

669
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,440
that we have at highmark

670
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,559
they provide a ton of support for us

671
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,159
you also get a lot of successful methods

672
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,919
of mitigating security threats

673
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,919
whether that's just joining an email

674
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,039
list

675
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,159
and people posting lists of iocs that

676
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,360
you can ingest

677
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,600
even that is a really good first step

678
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,280
into entering into intel sharing

679
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,600
relationships

680
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
community of best practices where topics

681
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,120
are discussed

682
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,000
i've had people ask me for advice on

683
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,240
interview questions since i do that for

684
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,440
my team i've had people ask what our

685
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,039
stock structure looks like

686
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,880
hey i've heard you guys use this tool is

687
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,159
that actually good

688
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,520
you get a lot of really great

689
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,080
discussions going from that

690
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
access to intel reports are specific to

691
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,600
your industry and community

692
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,919
um you know it just depends on the list

693
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,280
that you sign up for

694
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,280
and what your industry is but i highly

695
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,200
recommend that you seek those out

696
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,039
once you have a good intel sharing

697
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,640
network what are the sources that your

698
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,400
partners use the most often and how can

699
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,720
you get on that list

700
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,039
exclusive training in classes obviously

701
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,240
i wouldn't have actually found out about

702
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,000
secure wv if it weren't for some of my

703
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
intel contacts so

704
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,000
that was pretty great um and it also

705
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,360
helps law enforcement

706
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,280
quickly respond to threats like i was

707
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,640
talking about with the fusion center

708
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,360
earlier

709
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,760
we do have law enforcement involved in

710
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,799
that

711
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,200
fusion center so whenever we get

712
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,240
something really big

713
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,919
i do make sure i try to share that with

714
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,520
the group in case uh

715
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,720
they're seeing something across the

716
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,000
region where it could actually help

717
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,600
somebody and help them respond to a

718
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,919
crime more quickly

719
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,679
so how do you build these relationships

720
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,679
it can be pretty intimidating to go up

721
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,120
to somebody i mean it is

722
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,520
just networking though so attend

723
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,240
conferences

724
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,720
virtually for now hopefully this ends

725
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,520
soon

726
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,600
um but you know make sure that you're

727
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,799
going to these conferences

728
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,280
that you know information security

729
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,720
professionals are going to be at

730
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,960
uh that are specific to your industry

731
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,799
and where you actually might know some

732
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,480
people so they can introduce you to some

733
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,559
of their contacts

734
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,039
um some examples of this issa forums

735
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,480
they're all over the place

736
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,960
uh b-sides very good community

737
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,400
information information security

738
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,520
conference

739
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,400
local ones like this and then engaging

740
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,679
with your local government and law

741
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,039
enforcement

742
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,559
we have a good relationship with the

743
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,320
pennsylvania state police cyber

744
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,559
division they send us a cyber report

745
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,240
every single month

746
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,840
and you know while some of it is

747
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,159
outdated it's kind of good to get a

748
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,919
nice picture of everything that happened

749
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,360
that month and see if we missed

750
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,080
something

751
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,919
because oftentimes you know we get so

752
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,520
much intelligence that you know we might

753
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,880
miss something and it's nice to have

754
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,640
that comprehensive report and that

755
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,799
relationship in case we do see something

756
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,440
that we can share

757
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,360
seeking out publications circulated by

758
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,240
your any sort of local agency

759
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
infragard from the fbi is really good

760
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,400
for this they do

761
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,840
require a background check to get on

762
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,320
their mailing list but they send out

763
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,080
so many awesome white papers and

764
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,159
publications and i'm pretty sure that

765
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,840
you can specify which industries

766
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,760
you're most interested in seeing when

767
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,400
you sign up for that

768
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,919
again valuable intel and new contacts

769
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,919
that way and also

770
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,240
email just rows and chat rooms um you

771
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,760
know discord's great

772
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,640
obviously um i've i've been on a couple

773
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,240
different discord channels for this

774
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,480
and it's it's been great um also email

775
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,799
distros i'm a part of a couple for

776
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,320
the healthcare industry and we always

777
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,080
get really valuable and tell whether

778
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,960
that be

779
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,799
iocs or just general musings about

780
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,080
security incidents that people are

781
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,679
having

782
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,799
uh in regard i already mentioned so the

783
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,559
next step is actually maintaining those

784
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,080
relationships i think that's actually

785
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,880
more important

786
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,200
than forming them um you know you can

787
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,720
give somebody your business card and say

788
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,480
yeah i'll email you but

789
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,240
i mean you have to follow up if you're

790
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,840
going to actually make that relationship

791
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,640
a thing

792
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,559
so actively participate and contribute

793
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,799
to discussions with your intel partners

794
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,360
so tell them how did you use the intelli

795
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,000
provided

796
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
did you contribute into the intel to

797
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,120
them recently

798
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
um that's those are very important

799
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,400
things it is a back and forth

800
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,000
relationship you can't just

801
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,120
ingest and not help out so

802
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,880
attending networking events and checking

803
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,720
in with your contacts safely

804
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,640
um you know i've been to a couple zoom

805
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,919
happy hours with

806
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,600
various vendors um you know video calls

807
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,320
are great

808
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,960
with your intel contacts or just like a

809
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,480
phone call or an email like hey how you

810
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:38,960
doing

811
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,080
how are you dealing with all of this

812
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,440
what is your organization doing

813
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,960
differently during covid

814
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,799
um just something to get that

815
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,480
conversation started can be really

816
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,880
helpful

817
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,320
and then seeking out training

818
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,640
opportunities put out by organizations

819
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,799
you already have relationships with

820
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,039
i was talking to justin before we got on

821
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,000
this about the

822
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,880
one-time pgh conference that they did in

823
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,679
pittsburgh

824
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,640
to replace our b-sides it was it was so

825
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,360
much fun

826
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,799
and i think they did a really great job

827
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,880
with it and

828
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
you know you guys here at secure wv

829
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,360
doing the training before the conference

830
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,039
seeking out opportunities like that is a

831
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,799
really great way to

832
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,320
maintain those intel relationships and

833
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,679
check in with people you might not have

834
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,799
seen or talked to in a while

835
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,159

most of our threat intelligence needs um

893
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,200
and they they are a pretty pricey

894
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,399
service which has been

895
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,080
difficult um but they do have

896
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,679
a pretty awesome team that looks into

897
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,279
uh dark web instances so uh you know

898
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,320
we're able to do

899
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,600
quite a bit of monitoring on the dark

900
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,440
web through them um

901

clapping and like

939
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,279
hey before you leave there was another

940
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,640
question that popped up here it says are

941
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,919
there any sort of equation

942
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,440
are there any certifications that you

943
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,960
can uh that

944
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,919
that you think can help you get in let

945
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,360
me read that again sorry are there any

946
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,720
certifications

947
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,120
that you think that we can get to move

948
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,200
into this field

949
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,039
yeah um so the first certification i got

950
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,240
was my security plus

951
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,000
and that was within three months of me

952
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,919
getting my job at highmark

953
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,200
i got my g sec from sans last year and

954
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,600
i'm

955
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,840
looking to get another sans cert next

956
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,799
year

957
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,559
the cyber threat intelligence cert i

958
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,919
think it's four

959
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,039
five seven eight is the course name um

960
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,720
but definitely if you're looking to get

961
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,480
into this and anything in information

962
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,000
security security plus is a really good

963
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,600
place to start and then once you're in

964
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,720
the field for a bit

965
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,159
definitely the gsec i think it's a

966
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,279
really comprehensive cert

967
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,440
have you and i i don't mean to sound

968
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,480
disparaging but

969
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,720
sans is very expensive for people who

970
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,960
yes companies not paying for them

971
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,559
do you have any other do you get

972
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,720
something in a slightly cheaper

973
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,159
yeah so um juniper networks is

974
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,720
uh they actually offer a free cert so i

975
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,559
think it takes you like eight hours or

976
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,840
something like that but you do get a

977
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,519
certification at the end of it

978
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,640
and um it's a really good primer in all

979
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,000
things networking

980
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,640
so um highly recommend that if you're

981
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,279
not

982
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,039
already in infosec and have good

983
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,559
knowledge on it okay that's

984
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,159
pretty cool i did not know that

985
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,960
personally yeah

986
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,440
yeah i might go back and brush up on it

987
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,880
soon it's been a while since i took

988
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,799
it i like coming to conferences where i

989
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,600
learned to have no

990
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,840
actual skills whatsoever this is this is

991
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,559
great
