1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,080
johnson and i'm going to be talking

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,560
about the daleks performing jedi mind

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,200
melts

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,080
um i will admit uh and my wife will tell

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,800
you

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,000
that i am i'm a jerk

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,400
i i really am and when i came up with

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,839
this talk title

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,119
i would argue that i probably giggled

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,880
for four or five days uh so i was so

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,560
excited it got accepted because it was

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,199
like

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,199
no i have to do this talk somewhere i

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,240
have to be able to say

15
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,960
dalek's performing jedi mind melts um

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,760
and the idea

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,640
is this is based the entire talk and

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,920
i've got some slides

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,559
um but the reality is i'm just going to

20
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,160
discuss

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,280
my thought process around this um i will

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,160
also say that

23
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,440
due to my setup i can't see discord so

24
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,039
if you have questions i'm going to try

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,039
to pull those at the end

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,320
um it's just i'm

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,199
i'm technology challenged so um but

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,079
that's what we're gonna do

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,239
and yes i'm gonna warn you that there

30
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,359
are going to be

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,920
uh graphics like the oh my god it's r2d2

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,119
i loved him in star trek

33
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,640
one that's on the title slide i i

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,880
i think like i said i giggled for a few

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,960
days um and then i asked

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,759
internally at secure ideas i said hey

37
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,960
everybody

38
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,119
you know those pictures where they

39
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,040
combine a whole bunch of nerd stuff

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,920
to basically upset people um i want

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,479
those

42
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,200
any of those pictures you can find um

43
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,759
and

44
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,560
nathan eric and jason jumped on this to

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,000
share pictures with me

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,159
and uh this one this is actually a

47
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,920
t-shirt you can buy i guess

48
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,560
um one of the guys in the office he

49
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:38,960
actually

50
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,840
built a life-size r2d2 that's remote

51
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,640
control

52
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,560
and he has this shirt i don't know who

53
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,479
gave it to him but i think it's awesome

54
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,600
he has it

55
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,840
so a little bit about myself before we

56
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,720
get started

57
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,560
i'm like i said i'm kevin i've been

58
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,000
kevin for 47 years

59
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,439
i've been kevin johnson for 18 less

60
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,960
than that so you can do the math

61
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,479
excuse me i'm sorry i do not have covid

62
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,000
um i just have a

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,038
cough that's kicking my butt uh i am the

64
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,200
ceo which is another term for head

65
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,840
nerd here at secure ideas uh we've been

66
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,000
around since 2010 which i'm actually

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,440
really excited about

68
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,520
this year august was our 10th

69
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,720
anniversary

70
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,879
and for a company that was started by

71
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,760
accident

72
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,959
i think that having 22 staff members and

73
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,000
10 years under our belt is i'm not going

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,040
to say impressive

75
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,319
but i'm excited about it right so uh we

76
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,519
are a penetration testing company um i'm

77
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,920
if you don't know us come out

78
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,040
scarydios.com

79
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,519
we are the professionally evil people um

80
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,000
that's our slogan uh it seems to be

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,959
pretty popular

82
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,200
uh my favorite part of it is um i hate

83
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,640
stickers i don't know what it is about

84
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,319
me i just don't like stickers

85
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,440
um but years ago somebody said make a

86
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,120
sticker that just says professionally

87
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,400
evil and i want one

88
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,840
we were looking for swag and stuff like

89
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,200
that so we said okay sure fine we've

90
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,480
made stickers

91
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,720
we've given them out for years and my

92
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,239
favorite part of the stickers is

93
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,000
uh very often we'll be teaching a class

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,040
because that's one of the things we do

95
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,800
we teach a lot

96
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,200
we will teach class and we'll hand out

97
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,400
the professional evil stickers we'll

98
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,440
give them to people

99
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,920
and people put them on their laptop and

100
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,519
it's like hey

101
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,680

102
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,799

used to write for sans uh stop doing

120
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,159
that uh

121
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,239
stop teaching there but now i teach at

122
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,959
industry events i do private classes uh

123
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,959
we also just released our catalog for

124
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,959
next year so i'm excited about that

125
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,000
uh i'm an open source fanatic

126
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,519
i think is the right way to put it i uh

127
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,160
i'm the original creator of samurai wtf

128
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,440
still maintaining that

129
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,918
uh we just did our 5-0 release uh which

130
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,000
is crazy uh samurai is

131
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
actually older than secure ideas which

132
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,680
is in nuts uh

133
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,080
we had our 10th anniversary last year

134
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,199
for samurai

135
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,240
um a member of owasp i'm

136
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,000
actually just recently made the projects

137
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
committee vice chair a new committee

138
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,320
in owasp uh i think that might have been

139
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,080
a mistake because it's actual work

140
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,880
i have to do um and i have to say and

141
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,160
the pictures show it

142
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,720
uh i am a member of the 501st legion and

143
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,600
the rebel legion

144
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,400
uh we are a costuming group that raises

145
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,440
money for charity

146
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,600
so we build screen accurate costumes

147
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,840
like a chewbacca costume the darth vader

148
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,400
there

149
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,639
the clone trooper and then we wear them

150
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,400
to raise money for charity

151
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,320
and because we're nerds right uh we like

152
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,120
to wear

153
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,840
fun costumes um so if you have any

154
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,639
questions about that

155
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,840
we can talk about that later if you

156
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,639
would like

157
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,240
but let's uh talk about the mind melds

158
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,080
uh the jedi mind melds that we're gonna

159
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,759
do um

160
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,160
there's three sections to this talk one

161
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,360
is we're gonna talk about

162
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,560
why uh i think this is important

163
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,199
um second we're gonna talk about what

164
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,880
the issues are and the problems that

165
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,680
i've seen

166
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,320
and then some solutions for it and i and

167
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,280
i'm hoping

168
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,840
that those solutions will be helpful to

169
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,560
people

170
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,600
okay um because i think i actually think

171
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,320
this is a

172
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,360
really really important topic this is

173
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,720
uh one of those things that i see us

174
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,240
fail at day in and day out and i want to

175
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,240
be very clear i want you to notice

176
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,199
the we i said there i am one of the

177
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,160
people that fail

178
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,319
at this problem i am one of the people

179
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,840
that communicates

180
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,720
badly um i'm working on it and i think

181
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,280
that that's all that any of us can do

182
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,400
is work on it but we

183
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,680
have to do that if we don't

184
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,039
work on solving this problem we're

185
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,039
gonna have a bigger issue um

186
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,280
i threw this light in here uh yes

187
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,560
because i wanted to have a picture of

188
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,960
princess leia in a star trek costume

189
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,479
um but really because uh i i think we

190
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,360
all know

191
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,120
that security is critical i don't

192
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,800
believe that there's anybody

193
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,919
at this conference that doesn't

194
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,120
believe security is an important topic

195
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,919
right um we can say that but we can also

196
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,199
prove it because

197
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,199
uh we are finding the release of new

198
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,560
vulnerabilities

199
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,520
every single day constantly we hear

200
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,639
about

201
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,000
the the next greatest thing the

202
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,199
next thing with

203
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,720
vulnerabilities with logos and graphics

204
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,319
i know this has been going on for a

205
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,199
while it's

206
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,639
it's one of those things that i just

207
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,319
don't understand i

208
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,919
i i don't get it i'm not saying it's

209
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,520
wrong i'm just saying i don't understand

210
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:13,840
it

211
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,599
i am i've said this for years and

212
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,039
nobody's taken me up on it

213
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,960
i'm waiting for the first vulnerability

214
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,720
that has its own jingle

215
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,759
or theme song um i'm hoping

216
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,960
that we can get that at some point soon

217
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,960
but you know whatever but we're also

218
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,080
hearing about breaches right

219
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,560
everything from ransomware going crazy

220
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,880
to people actually compromising systems

221
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,199
and breaking applications and

222
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,759
and let's be blunt i do it right as part

223
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,960
of my job

224
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,800
i'm actually doing it this week i'm

225
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,560
working with a company

226
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,280
uh they're a business service company

227
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,039
i'm being vague on purpose

228
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,440
um one because we have non-disclosure

229
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,039
agreements and two because

230
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,680
um they're my customer and they may be

231
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,319
listening

232
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,520
um but we've been working with this one

233
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,560
company

234
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,680
uh this one client for years

235
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,599
and yet we still find vulnerabilities in

236
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,720
their applications

237
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,680
we and i and i guarantee you that's not

238
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,080
unique right i i can pick on this one

239
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,360
customer and i can do that because

240
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:13,919
they're

241
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,120
they're friendly we have a good

242
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,039
relationship we try to help them and

243
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,160
work with them

244
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,199
and so they they know that when i say

245
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,319
man that vulnerability we found last

246
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,800
year when we tested you still exist this

247
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,759
year

248
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,319
um they know i say it because i want

249
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,120
them to get

250
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,839
better i i don't pen test because i

251
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,360
think hacking is awesome

252
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,000
i i do think hacking is awesome i tell

253
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,799
people all the time

254
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,919
that i have the best job in the world i

255
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,120
get to come in

256
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,640
break your stuff tell you you suck

257
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,360
and then i go home i don't actually have

258
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,560
to fix anything

259
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,640
right man that application is in awful

260
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,440
shape

261
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,680
how could you possibly push that to

262
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,800
production

263
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,000
goodbye have a nice day i don't fix

264
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,720
i don't remediate i recommend i can help

265
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,399
you understand what the recommend

266
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,440
the fixes are the remediations are

267
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,279
but i don't do it and the reason i don't

268
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,800
do it just to be very clear

269
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,320
is because when we formed secure ideas

270
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,640
we discussed whether or not we wanted to

271
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,399
offer the service of fixing stuff and we

272
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,279
said no

273
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,040
because we think that it's a conflict of

274
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,760
interest right if i say to you

275
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,720
this is bad it's broken it sucks but you

276
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,279
know what

277
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,760
don't worry for an extra twenty thousand

278
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,560
dollars

279
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,360
i'll fix it oh man isn't that great

280
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,240
right um

281
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,560
all of a sudden we lose credibility we

282
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,360
lose

283
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,160
the ability to say that we are only

284
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,880
recommending the things that we

285
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,399
believe are good the only the things

286
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,000
that we believe are actually

287
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,200
important for you to do

288
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,600
but why can't we fix this i don't know

289
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,120
about you

290
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,480
but i started in it professionally

291
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,800
in 1991. i'm old i'm an old fat lazy guy

292
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,839
right uh plain and simple and when i

293
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,360
graduated high school because i don't

294
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,200
have a college degree and i'm not

295
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,040
bashing college degrees they're they're

296
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,160
good for the people who want them and

297
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,200
need them and whatever

298
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,760
uh right bill but i don't have one

299
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,519
um i i when i graduated high school

300
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,160
i joined a company with something that

301
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,640
we would call a startup today

302
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,760
um but back then it was just a job

303
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,640
right um startup wasn't a term that we

304
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,040
knew

305
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,000
in south florida i guess i don't know um

306
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,800
and i was

307
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,320
a developer for them i was

308
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,279
running their network and i was running

309
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,800
their bulletin board system

310
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,200
if you really want to feel old we had a

311
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,440
12 line bulletin board system running

312
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,680
out of an office in delray beach florida

313
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,440
um running oh my gosh galacticon

314
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,200
bbs um i'm old i said that already but

315
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,399
it's true

316
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,440
right and so we we ran this system

317
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,279
and we built code and we released

318
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,800
software for customers

319
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,279
um basically we did development for

320
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,240
power companies

321
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,079
um we wrote controller software

322
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,040
for their hardware um now i don't know

323
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,880
if you can do the math but i can

324
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,440
in 1991 is almost 30 years ago

325
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,200
okay almost a couple months

326
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,079
and then it is right so almost 30 years

327
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,839
ago i was writing software

328
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,760
for power companies okay i

329
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,600
work with power companies today

330
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,680
a couple years ago we were in on-site at

331
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,640
a power company

332
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,760
and they were running the software i

333
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,519
wrote almost 30 years ago

334
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,079
now i would like to tell you that i am

335
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,079
the smartest developer you will ever

336
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,480
meet and there is no way possible

337
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,639
that i have vulnerabilities and code

338
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,240
that i wrote

339
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,480
notice i said i would love to tell you

340
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,519
that

341
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,040
it would be a lie it totally bluntly

342
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,160
plainly and honestly would be a lie and

343
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,800
yes i said

344
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,639
honestly it's a lie but i don't know you

345
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,000
know oxymorons jumbo

346
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,600
military intelligence whatever right

347
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,720
i know that the code i wrote almost 30

348
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,360
years ago

349
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,639
sucked i know it i know that there are

350
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,440
things we

351
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,959
considered today basic architecture

352
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:33,839
decisions

353
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,120
and foundational concepts that i had

354
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,040
no understanding of or thought around

355
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,360
i wrote my code i published it i pushed

356
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,760
it to the system

357
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,000
our software development life cycle was

358
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,320
bob and i yes the guy's name was bob bob

359
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,760
morris he had nothing to do with the

360
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,279
morris worm

361
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,240
as far as i know but his name was bob

362
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,160
morris and he ran the company

363
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,920
and i was the young nerd he hired

364
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,800
and the two of us would write code and

365
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,480
we'd talk about it and we would discuss

366
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,920
things and we never talked about

367
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,680
security we never talked

368
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,639
about communication protocols we never

369
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,519
talked about

370
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,519
how to ensure our code was formatted

371
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,800
well at the very least never thought of

372
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,000
those things

373
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,880
never talked about them now you may say

374
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,079
well kevin that's because you were a

375
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:28,480
jerk

376
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,399
and an idiot and i you know what i'll go

377
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,160
with that i have no problem with that

378
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,480
but the reality is

379
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,279
that i meet with companies today i talk

380
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:37,600
to

381
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,639
customers today

382
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,680
that they still don't know

383
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,440
the things bob and i did not discuss

384
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,199
or work on almost 30 years ago

385
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,240
so why can we not fix this

386
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,639
because i know we've tried i know we

387
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,480
have things like i am the cavalry and i

388
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,000
am this and i am going to do public

389
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,360
disclosure and i'm going gonna do that

390
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,160
we've got the

391
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,959
i just read an article about php being

392
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,760
removed from the internet bug bounty

393
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,600
uh due to a lack of conversation and i'm

394
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,160
not gonna argue either side of that one

395
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,959
but if we're still working on this if

396
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,320
we're still pushing for this

397
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,199
why can't we fix it because the reality

398
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:19,920
is

399
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,120
we are fighting the same things

400
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,360
today that we were fighting in nineteen

401
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,880
i think this was nineteen nine 1988

402
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,800
okay and i want to be very clear i'm not

403
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,120
bashing send mail here

404
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,320
but i found it interesting

405
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,360
that the very first bug track

406
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,480
id was for a send mail vulnerability in

407
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,600
1988

408
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,720
the very first one bug track id

409
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,160
one and

410
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,480
in july for the people here the date

411
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,839
format is year

412
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,760
month day just to be very clear in july

413
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,959
of 2020 send mail

414
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,120
has a security bug that they fixed

415
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,920
so are you telling me that sendmail

416
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,800
didn't know

417
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,680
about security i mean we can make that

418
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,959
joke

419
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,800
but it wouldn't be fair because i know

420
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,079
for a fact

421
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,000
that people i've worked with that deal

422
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,519
with send mail that work on send mail

423
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,160
whatever

424
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,000
they think about security they consider

425
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,880
security so why are we fighting the same

426
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,759
battles

427
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,160
and in my opinion and the reason for the

428
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,000
talk title the reason i came up with the

429
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,120
name of the talk title

430
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,120
is because we don't know how to

431
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,560
communicate risk

432
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,160
we don't we fail at communicating and

433
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,440
yes

434
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,480
i know the tweet is old but i feel like

435
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,959
this tweet is such a great example

436
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,720
of how we don't know how to communicate

437
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,040
risk so cvss

438
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,079
something i've railed about for years if

439
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,759
you have not heard me rant you're not

440
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,199
going to hear me rant today

441
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,880
okay you might hear me rant today

442
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,600
we came up with this cvss thing oh it's

443
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,759
a common vulnerability scoring system

444
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,639
okay great

445
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,120
except accept

446
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,639
i can put in and answer all the

447
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,120
questions correctly

448
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,320
for a simple cross-site scripting attack

449
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,360
that has a score a base score and i

450
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,240
understand how temporal scores work

451
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,279
a base score of 9.3

452
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,759
i can do the same exact equation for a

453
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,800
remote

454
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,680
code execution bug that gives you the

455
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,959
ability to run

456
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,560
commands on the back end

457
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,920
and it will get a low score because and

458
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,680
i understand the difficulty they have of

459
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,120
coming up with the scoring system i get

460
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,000
that

461
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,240
okay but we have this cvss thing that

462
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,000
has failed us for years and we just keep

463
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,320
updating it

464
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,959
and then we have things like ibrahim

465
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:01,680
balik

466
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,079
i'm not sure how to pronounce the name

467
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,280
right

468
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,720
but here's what he tweeted out a few

469
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,319
years ago and and yes

470
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,520
i i know it's old okay but apple this is

471
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,959
definitely not a hack attack i'm not a

472
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,720
hacker i do security research

473
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,679
now i want to point out you didn't tag

474
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:18,880
apple

475
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,520
right he didn't tell them directly they

476
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,280
didn't he didn't follow their disclosure

477
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,000
process

478
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,520
whether you agree that their disclosure

479
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,679
process is good bad or indifferent

480
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,760
he didn't do any of that he released a

481
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,799
tweet

482
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,919
said hey i'm not hacking you

483
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,320
this video he released was of him

484
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,600
exploiting a bug

485
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,679
in their developer network that took

486
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,760
their developer network down

487
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,520
for quite a while the same guy took down

488
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,320
if i remember correctly sony uh ibm and

489
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,200
somebody else i

490
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,000
i don't remember all of them right and

491
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,440
we can have the debate

492
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,960
about security research or whatever

493
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,160
but the reality is if you reach out to

494
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,360
this guy and you can't do it on twitter

495
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,200
anymore because his account's suspended

496
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,080
uh i guess that's a common thing

497
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,200
nowadays

498
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,600
um

499
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,440
when you reached out to him and talked

500
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,160
to him about it he saw nothing wrong

501
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,760
with this being the way he would

502
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,919
communicate right

503
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,640
and again i'm not debating what he did

504
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,240
i've got my opinions i've made my

505
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,400
opinions clear over the years

506
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,679
what i'm talking about is how we

507
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,760
communicate that risk

508
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,600
is somebody at apple communicating the

509
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,960
risk of some guy

510
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,799
in turkey tweeting about a vulnerability

511
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,320
i don't know i would hope so i would

512
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,559
assume so okay

513
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,880
but but we don't know so let's talk

514
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,679
about the

515
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,960
issues themselves okay and i've broken

516
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,720
these issues into four

517
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,080
categories four types of communication

518
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,120
failures

519
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,240
that we see okay and i'm gonna talk

520
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,880
through

521
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,799
uh what they mean i'm gonna try to give

522
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,880
you examples that i've seen

523
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,440
of places we fail at it and then we'll

524
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,280
talk about how we can solve it

525
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,919
okay how we can fix these four issues

526
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:08,480
okay

527
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,840
the first one language

528
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,240
i love these movies but uh i'm sorry

529
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,600
i really have a nerd i i i and every bit

530
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,000
of me

531
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,240
wants to know i'm hoping you all are

532
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,360
cringing at the

533
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,440
crossover pictures i'm doing but

534
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,120
one of the primary reasons that we see

535
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,240
communication failures is language and

536
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,760
i want to be very clear i'm not talking

537
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,080
english german russian chinese

538
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,280
i'm talking about the way we describe

539
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,240
what we do

540
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,120
how we talk about it the language that

541
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,600
we

542
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,280
use and i'll give you some examples okay

543
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,480
we use more acronyms than the military

544
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,720
that may not be true but it feels that

545
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,520
way

546
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,720
right everything we do is an acronym

547
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,480
help we have an acronym for acronyms tla

548
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,200
three-letter acronym right we are

549
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,360
redundant with acronyms

550
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,840
gnu

551
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,320
ssl tls what's the difference

552
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,679
they're different acronyms right

553
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,760
and we use these things as if everybody

554
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,600
knows what they are

555
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,760
and not everybody does and let's be very

556
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,039
clear we think

557
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,440
they do but if i come to you and say man

558
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,760
the tls configuration of your system is

559
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,880
bad

560
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,520
right what am i talking about what

561
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,960
configuration do i mean

562
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,159
now you can assume

563
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,600
that i'm talking about transport layer

564
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,440
security and

565
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,200
within context i probably am okay

566
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,480
but do you know what about saying ssl

567
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,880
secure socket layer right and i can play

568
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,559
this game we can talk about acronyms

569
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,679
right

570
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,039
i remember back when i was at in

571
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,880
guardians uh

572
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,640
we were working with a customer and we

573
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,600
were scoping a job

574
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,440
and the customer kept referring to

575
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,960
all of the tcp hosts that they had

576
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,120
and i felt that that was a weird way to

577
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,480
say it right but

578
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,320
okay we were talking about a network pen

579
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,000
test and they were talking about the tcp

580
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,039
hosts

581
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,799
and well the tcp hosts this and we've

582
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,200
got 27 of those tcp hosts and when we

583
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,240
got these uh 37 other tcp hosts and

584
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,559
um okay great great great great we're

585
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,080
asking questions and they're answering

586
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,919
questions we they keep talking about tcp

587
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,360
hosts and we keep counting them as

588
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,039
network hosts

589
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,440
and then it turns out that for that

590
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,240
organization

591
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,600
tcp wasn't a

592
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,400
transmission control protocol it was an

593
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:50,960
internal

594
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,799
application and i don't remember the

595
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,960
name of the application i'm sorry but it

596
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,880
started with t c and p um

597
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,600
and what they were discussing was an

598
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,120
application

599
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,640
test what we were discussing was a

600
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,480
network test those are different

601
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,960
right and the miscommunication was

602
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,760
really because

603
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,559
nobody broke down and said hey

604
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,400
you keep talking about these tcp hosts

605
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,760
what are they

606
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,919
and let's be blunt they didn't know what

607
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,120
they were asking for

608
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,559
they were an ignorant customer

609
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,640
okay and i don't mean that as an insult

610
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,120
it just means they don't know

611
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,720
okay they didn't know what they were

612
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,400
asking for they had been told we have to

613
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,760
have a penetration test

614
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,760
so they came to us said hey i want a

615
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,240
penetration test of these tcp hosts and

616
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,880
we said

617
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,400
great we can do a pen test of those tcp

618
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,640
hosts they wanted us to address the

619
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,840
application

620
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,360
we scoped testing the network

621
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,159
now we caught it before we started the

622
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,440
work

623
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,280
why because we wrote up an srw we sent

624
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,720
it over to them and they asked more

625
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,760
questions

626
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,880
they kept asking about a wasp okay

627
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,919
um that's interesting why are you

628
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:10,960
and that's when we found out they were

629
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,559
talking about applications and it was

630
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,159
because they were using an acronym that

631
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,080
we didn't know

632
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,640
and we assumed it meant what we thought

633
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,919
it meant

634
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,760
and let's make it even worse right

635
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,679
because i've got these

636
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,720
four items with the organization

637
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,559
that and that could be the company

638
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,600
that could be the government agency

639
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,360
but i'm using it here as the

640
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,280
organization of people talking about

641
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,559
this system the people who are

642
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,240
responsible for security the people who

643
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,520
are responsible for

644
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,840
the business all working together which

645
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,880
means that that one or more of those

646
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,000
boxes can be a third party

647
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,960
okay which makes it even more confusing

648
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,600
because

649
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,360
third parties have their own language

650
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,799
and their own internal stuff

651
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,000
and their own language

652
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,080
that they use do you know how many times

653
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,840
i've been on a call with somebody

654
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,960
and i've referred to a pen test and had

655
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,159
the customer say to me

656
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,039
what's a pen test didn't you want a

657
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:13,919
penetration test

658
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:19,600
yeah i do oh that's a pen test

659
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,000
yeah because i shorten it when i say it

660
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,760
because i'm lazy

661
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,440
okay and so we have this problem where

662
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,960
we use different languages

663
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,480
and that problem actually can cause more

664
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,200
issues right because when we start to

665
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,080
discuss things

666
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,919
when we start to discuss what the

667
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,679
solutions are

668
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,799
the remediations are we have to make

669
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,080
sure that we're speaking the same

670
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,200
language

671
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,480
okay we see this fall down

672
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,120
constantly

673
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,360
and sadly a lot of times

674
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,640
we see people react angry or insulting

675
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,000
or aggressive

676
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,039
when that communication fails

677
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,200
because we're using a different language

678
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,559
right we actually

679
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,159
see people start to bicker and argue and

680
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,080
or or one of the things we see all the

681
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,400
time both on the penetration test side

682
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,520
the business side

683
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,919
and the technology side is that you

684
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,039
assume

685
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,120
that the person on the other side

686
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,400
doesn't understand because they're dumb

687
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,520
not because they didn't understand the

688
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,320
language

689
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,559
something i've seen a lot and and this i

690
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,080
said i wasn't speaking about spoken

691
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,880
languages but

692
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,520
it's i think it's a good example how

693
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,799
many times

694
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,760
it's to the point where it's a

695
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,240
stereotype in sitcoms right

696
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,000
how many times do you hear somebody who

697
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,919
has a very strong accent

698
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,480
talking to somebody who to you does not

699
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,320
have an accent let's be very clear

700
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,120
perspective is important in this example

701
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,640
right but how many times do you hear

702
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,480
somebody they have a very strong accent

703
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,080
it's the person speaking to them assumes

704
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,120
they don't know they don't understand

705
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,400
accent you must be an idiot right

706
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,120
and what i find fascinating about that

707
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,880
is let's be very clear

708
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,039
if somebody has a very strong accent

709
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,159
because

710
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,720
the language they're currently speaking

711
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,200
is

712
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,880
not their primary language that means

713
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,159
they're already smarter than i am

714
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,400
because they know two languages i barely

715
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,039
know english

716
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,240
yet because of the way they speak

717
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,600
because of the language

718
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,520
they're using and the words they leave

719
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,120
out or they say

720
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,880
wrong the emphasis is on the wrong

721
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,520
syllable

722
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,320
we assume they're dumb the same exact

723
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:46,640
thing

724
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,880
happens between the business security

725
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,159
and technology

726
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,240
right how many times have you heard a

727
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,120
security person say

728
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,320
those users are idiots they don't know

729
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,440
what they're talking about they don't

730
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,720
know what they're doing

731
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,559
right we hear it all the time we see it

732
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,080
all the time how many times do you hear

733
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,840
it people say id 10 error id 10t

734
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,559
error keep cac problem exists between

735
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,320
keyboard and chair

736
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,919
right let me be clear

737
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,279
the business is talking about you the

738
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,279
same way

739
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,120
the project manager is talking about you

740
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,640
the same way the help desk

741
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,360
person the customer support person the

742
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,640
manager

743
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,600
is talking about you the same way

744
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,559
they're talking up

745
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,120
you're talking about them we have to

746
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,799
stop it

747
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,000
the next thing we have to do is have an

748
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,320
understanding i

749
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,039
i this is one that drives me crazy

750
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,320
understanding is one of the most

751
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,360
critical parts

752
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,399
of communication if you and i don't

753
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,279
understand

754
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,880
what we're talking about and i don't

755
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,799
mean do you know

756
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,840
what http 30 is

757
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,200
what i'm talking about is do you

758
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,080
understand everything

759
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,159
about this system that you're

760
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,440
complaining about

761
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,559
right i see this a lot

762
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,760
especially from security people that

763
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,799
don't have a background in it

764
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,320
or the business or whatever right and

765
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,640
i'm not i'm not defeating anybody here

766
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,200
i'm trying

767
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,679
i'm not trying to gatekeep or or yell at

768
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:24,240
people

769
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,320
but we see a large number of people

770
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,640
that have graduated from something

771
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,840
whether it's high school

772
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,679
college uh oscp i don't care what

773
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,919
and they're a pen tester

774
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,960
and you ask them have you ever built a

775
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,240
server no

776
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,960
have you ever built code no what's your

777
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,760
background

778
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,279
well i went to high school in college

779
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,799
and now i'm a penetration investor

780
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,799
great okay cool and you find a

781
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,559
vulnerability and do you understand what

782
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,679
that vulnerability means to the

783
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,600
organization

784
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
do you understand what that

785
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,279
vulnerability means

786
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,360
to the work effort for the it people

787
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,120
that have to implement your fix

788
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,840
i i one of the my favorite examples of

789
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,399
this is the equifax breach and yes

790
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,840
i know old example

791
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,799
struts had a deserialization issue

792
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,640
the bug was known about patch was not

793
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,039
available yet

794
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,760
and equifax was compromised maybe the

795
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,720
patch was available

796
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,159
i don't remember right and

797
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,200
security went gleefully

798
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,880
down the path of victim oh

799
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,000
why didn't you wow blind

800
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,559
i had somebody say to me let me be very

801
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,799
clear there was lots of somebodies

802
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,600
but i had somebody say to me all equifax

803
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,200
had to do was patch

804
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,520
and i said to them have you ever patched

805
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,120
struts

806
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,120
no have you ever been part of a java

807
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,480
application

808
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,520
at an enterprise level being built on a

809
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,559
framework like struts

810
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,640
no okay so how do you patch struts

811
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,760
well you apply the patch

812
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,760
and and the person stopped

813
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,520
and i said you really don't understand

814
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,159
the development life cycle do you

815
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,520
well why does it matter it's just a

816
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,919
patch but it's not just a patch and i

817
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,279
want to be very clear i'm not saying

818
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,279
it's okay that equifax was breached i'm

819
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,559
not saying it's okay that

820
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,080
vulnerabilities exist and that

821
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,559
equifax hadn't fixed it i don't know

822
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,399
anything about their internal workings

823
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,480
and what process they were following

824
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,840
right but i do

825
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,440
know that applying a patch

826
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,120
to struts is not the same

827
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,879
as clicking windows update

828
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,320
you have to apply the patch in your

829
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,000
development environment

830
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,440
you then have to modify any of the code

831
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,880
that doesn't work any longer because

832
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,240
the new version of struts changed the

833
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:02,960
framework

834
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,000
calls there was a reason

835
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,279
companies were still running the old

836
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,279
framework again

837
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,120
not saying it's okay not saying it's

838
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,480
excusable i'm

839
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,440
saying that we don't understand their

840
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,799
processes

841
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,200
their reality which we'll talk about in

842
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,559
a bit

843
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,120
about how they fix that then you have to

844
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,880
run that fix

845
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,840
all the way up the pipeline development

846
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,360
performance testing

847
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,559
sit integration testing staging

848
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,399
qa production i was very clear

849
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,159
i listed a whole bunch of environments i

850
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,320
have no idea if they have

851
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,000
i do know organizations i've been out of

852
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,159
padam i know that i was the webster

853
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,399
administrator at a company

854
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,320
that our development environment every

855
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,159
single development team

856
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,840
had three the unit

857
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,519
sit test perf

858
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,080
stage t prime

859
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,279
a b n c

860
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,799
and everything had to go through all of

861
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,200
them can you imagine

862
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,240
what the process would be to

863
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,720
patch struts in that organization

864
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,000
how to get that organization up to the

865
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,440
version that wasn't vulnerable to the

866
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,880
decentralization attack

867
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,440
i can imagine it because i was there

868
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,840
when they upgraded other frameworks

869
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,120
similarly

870
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,880
i know the process i know the amount of

871
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,640
effort and let's be very clear

872
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,320
we can make this easy fix it

873
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,720
okay you have the budget do the time do

874
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,679
the resources

875
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,840
are you going to affect the deadlines on

876
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,960
everything else we're doing it doesn't

877
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,480
matter it's security it's important

878
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,799
yeah it is do you understand

879
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,080
that security

880
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,279
does not make anybody money

881
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,279
just because they're secure okay

882
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,640
it's true i'll talk about my company

883
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,080
we have secure in our name

884
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,360
our entire job is to assess

885
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,200
other people's security and tell them

886
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,039
where their problems are

887
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,279
and teach them how to do exactly that

888
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,559
right yet nobody

889
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,240
in 10 years of business nobody

890
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,120
has ever come to secure ideas and said

891
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,919
kevin

892
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,480
here's what we're going to do we've

893
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,080
decided you're secure

894
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,919
now i want to be very clear my example

895
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,360
i'm saying they decided

896
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,559
i'm scared i'm not saying it i'm not

897
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,120
i'm not jinxing that one because i'll

898
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,720
tell you i'd like to believe we're as

899
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,640
secure as we can be

900
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,080
but i also know there's a lot of people

901
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,159
smarter than i am right

902
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,679
it's not a challenge but they

903
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:56,799
nobody has ever come to me and said

904
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,960
kevin i think you're secure

905
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,000
so here's a million dollars nobody has

906
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,720
said

907
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,679
i think you're secure so let me pay you

908
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,600
money

909
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,000
no what they say is kevin i'd like to

910
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,960
pay you money

911
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,280
for a class are you secure

912
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,719
because i want you to be i want you

913
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,199
to think about that security but really

914
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,159
what i'm paying for

915
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,839
is the knowledge i gain in that class or

916
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,599
hey i'd like a pen test i'd like

917
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,679
vulnerability assessments i'd like you

918
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,520
to test my applications and work with my

919
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,320
developers in an advisory role

920
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,719
that's what they're paying me for they

921
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,399
would like me to be secure

922
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,280
while i do all that stuff and they give

923
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,599
me

924
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,800
stupid spreadsheets to fill out for sig

925
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,879
questionnaires i've got customers and

926
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,480
every time a vulnerability is announced

927
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,199
in the news

928
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,480
i get an email that says kevin have you

929
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,359
addressed this

930
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,560
in our systems that you maintain for us

931
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,760
meaning the portal we run

932
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,760
the training environment we run right

933
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,280
and i get to give them an answer as to

934
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,200
how i've addressed that vulnerability in

935
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,119
my own systems

936
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,560
so they care about security

937
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,359
are we just talking past each other i

938
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,119
use the example of social media i see it

939
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,400
all the time i do it

940
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,960
all the time i post something people

941
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,480
assume they know what i mean

942
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,200
i assumed they knew what i meant the two

943
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,920
of us

944
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,599
believed something different about what

945
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,760
i meant but we talked about it it's like

946
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,480
oh

947
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,280
that's not what i said

948
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,680
well it's what you wrote no it's how you

949
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,599
understood what i wrote

950
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,359
or i wrote it that way and i meant it

951
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,640
some other way

952
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,079
right we talk past each other

953
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,960
constantly i see this very much in

954
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,320
security

955
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,359
right how many times have you ever

956
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,320
worked

957
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,040
as a security person with a developer

958
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,359
and

959
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,800
told them about a vulnerability that

960
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,680
they needed to take account

961
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,440
did you share with them your

962
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,720
understanding of the problem

963
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,800
so that they could understand the

964
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,320
problem

965
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,480
one of the things we see quite often we

966
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,320
will write up a report and i will be

967
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,119
blunt

968
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,839
i believe that our reports are very good

969
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,160
at explaining what a vulnerability is

970
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,560
what it means how you find it and how

971
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,400
you fix it and if you want we have a

972
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,359
knowledge center

973
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,200
up on our website that you can download

974
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,880
our sample report

975
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,240
no issue you don't even have to give us

976
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,599
your name to download it just click the

977
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,000
link

978
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,960
download and you get a pdf that has no

979
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,640
malware that we put there

980
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,800
um i i have to say that because adobe

981
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,839
could put malware in there

982
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,760
so it has a sample report and i'd like

983
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,720
to believe

984
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,320
it's entertaining me that this one box

985
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,720
is off sorry i can see it i'm just

986
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,920
freaking out about it

987
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,200
um but the reality is

988
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,320
that that pdf i think

989
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,680
tells you what the vulnerability is i

990
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,359
think it does a good job of explaining

991
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:57,760
what

992
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,000
sql injection is i think it does a good

993
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,880
job of saying

994
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,560
here's where you find sql injection in

995
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,040
your application right

996
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,040
and yet time and time and time again

997
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,520
luckily not the majority of our tests

998
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,520
we'll talk to a developer

999
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,599
and they'll say okay i fixed the problem

1000
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,880
and then we'll find a way to break what

1001
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,839
they fixed

1002
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,839
right the example i always give because

1003
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,359
it's happened multiple times

1004
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,960
is we find something like sql injection

1005
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,119
and we tell them look here is a payload

1006
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,960
that works single quote or one equals

1007
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,040
one semicolon dash dash space

1008
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,599
and that payload injected in dumped your

1009
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,040
database

1010
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,400
that's bad so fix it and the way you fix

1011
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,640
it is parameterize queries

1012
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,320
right and then we'll go for a re-test

1013
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,320
because they fix the problem

1014
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,760
and we'll go to the vulnerability we'll

1015
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,440
type tick or one equals one semicolon

1016
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,280
dash dash space

1017
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,400
and it won't work and then we'll put

1018
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,119
two equals two because the people on

1019
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,800
this call i know you know

1020
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,480
that one equals one is not a magic

1021
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,079
string

1022
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,839
what it goes one is a tautology it's a

1023
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,520
self-evidently true statement it just

1024
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,440
means that both sides of that

1025
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,640
are true at all times one

1026
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,040
always equals one even if you print one

1027
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,359
really big and another one in sharpie

1028
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,760
okay but two equals two is also true

1029
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,280
and the payload works just the same and

1030
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,119
so if you didn't pay attention to the

1031
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,000
remediation

1032
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,599
if you didn't pay attention to what the

1033
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,280
explanation of the problem was you just

1034
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,480
assumed that one equals one was a bad

1035
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,480
string and you're not going to actually

1036
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,960
fix the problem

1037
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,960
we also see quite often we just had a

1038
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,640
customer get really well wasn't a

1039
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,560
customer they hired a third party

1040
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,760
development company

1041
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,880
we did a test for them

1042
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,560
they failed and now i want to be very

1043
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,079
clear our penetration tests are not

1044
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,599
pass fail okay but this penetration test

1045
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,200
was so

1046
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,599
god-awful bad that i don't know another

1047
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,440
way to put it

1048
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,160
and we said to them man this is awful

1049
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,520
like and should we stop the task we

1050
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,040
actually stopped the test

1051
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,880
it said you're not ready for this pen

1052
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,240
test you're not you

1053
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,000
you this is just throwing your money

1054
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,480
away and while i am a greedy capitalist

1055
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,079
i don't want you to just throw your

1056
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,680
money away i mean if you're going to

1057
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,960
throw it away please throw it away

1058
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,079
toward me

1059
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,599
but so we stopped the test we sat down

1060
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,720
with the development team and we

1061
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,560
explained what we were seeing we talked

1062
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,040
to them about where the problem was

1063
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,760
and we said look we tested for a day

1064
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,320
that's it

1065
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,160
it was a five-day test we tested for a

1066
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,920
day we pulled the plug it's

1067
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,119
done stop okay kevin yeah we got it we

1068
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,400
got it we got it we got it we got it we

1069
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,920
got it we got it we got it and they come

1070
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,520
back

1071
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,240
about a month later maybe two and they

1072
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:40,880
said okay

1073
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,800
we're ready we're ready we got it we oh

1074
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,960
man kevin it's so great we've fixed

1075
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,680
everything we're completely secure now

1076
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,880
now i want to be very clear the minute

1077
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,480
you tell me you're completely secure

1078
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,359
i start to giggle i also start to worry

1079
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:54,240
about the report

1080
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,920
because i know that report is going to

1081
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,680
be huge because you're going to have so

1082
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,079
many vulnerabilities because

1083
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,560
you're claiming to be secure but okay

1084
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,680
we'll ignore that

1085
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,040
and so we go in there and sure enough

1086
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,720
some of the examples we've given them

1087
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,079
they had fixed now they had not fixed

1088
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,200
all of them

1089
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,960
and when we pushed them on that like hey

1090
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,920
you know this doesn't appear to be

1091
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,319
touched

1092
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,119
oh yeah yeah we ran out of time okay but

1093
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,319
you said you were okay fine

1094
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,880
never mind never mind but then we start

1095
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,920
realizing

1096
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,960
that what they had done is they had

1097
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,599
fixed exactly the vulnerability we told

1098
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,640
them about

1099
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,319
they didn't understand and i want to

1100
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,240
very clear we pulled the plug on the

1101
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,240
test we made it very clear to everybody

1102
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,319
we were pulling the plug on the test

1103
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:37,760
right we had not

1104
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,599
completed a comprehensive test

1105
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,680
they fixed exactly what we told them was

1106
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,040
wrong not

1107
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,520
the fundamental problems that we had

1108
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,520
told them were the issue

1109
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,400
okay and so we went back to them and we

1110
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,440
said hey

1111
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,040
what's going on here like you haven't

1112
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,520
done this and they came back and said

1113
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,680
well but kevin you you didn't list those

1114
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,160
other things as problems

1115
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,400
but what do you what do you mean we

1116
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,200
didn't list

1117
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,400
those other things as problems well you

1118
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,000
you told me about the authentication

1119
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,960
bypass on the login form

1120
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,880
but you didn't tell me that you could

1121
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,200
access things other than the main

1122
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,079
page and and i said to the person i was

1123
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:20,560
talking to

1124
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,640
who's the lead architect the lead

1125
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,480
developer for this third-party company

1126
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,079
that i wish i could tell you who you are

1127
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,079
so they could never hire them

1128
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,240
in their entire organizational life

1129
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,680
because they were awful

1130
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,839
and i said to the guy like dude i say

1131
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,119
dude way too often

1132
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,400
um like dude we told you that your

1133
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,720
authentication and authorization system

1134
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,480
didn't it just didn't right

1135
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,960
that i could access through it without

1136
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,680
any

1137
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,160
hesitation he says yeah but you told us

1138
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,000
you could get to the main page i said no

1139
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
i told you that everything we tested did

1140
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,599
not perform author authentication and

1141
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,079
authorization checks

1142
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,520
and the guy said yeah but your example

1143
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,240
was the main page like yes you know the

1144
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,000
definition of the word example right

1145
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,440
oh wait i guess you don't it was an

1146
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,880
example

1147
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,880
but we told you that your system was

1148
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,640
broken your system didn't

1149
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,839
do anything your system was

1150
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:16,000
fundamentally

1151
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,760
flawed whatever phrase we want to come

1152
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,280
up with

1153
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,440
he didn't understand that because they

1154
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,640
didn't fix anything

1155
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,040
other than the exact example we gave

1156
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,760
them

1157
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,960
okay and part of me is hesitant to use

1158
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,240
this as an example because we hadn't

1159
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,720
even generated a real report

1160
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,960
because we hadn't finished the test

1161
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,200
right

1162
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,560
the other thing we have to talk about is

1163
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,400
reality and i

1164
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,560
i i hesitate to talk about this one

1165
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,760
because a lot of people like oh but

1166
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,280
kevin don't you understand

1167
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,240
no maybe i don't but what i find is that

1168
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:50,839
we

1169
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:54,640
exaggerate a lot

1170
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:00,000
the biggest flaw to hit the world ever

1171
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,319
internet of things is going to destroy

1172
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,040
us

1173
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,520
the latest example that i can think of

1174
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,280
and i am sure that if i dig a little bit

1175
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,720
further i'll find newer ones

1176
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,200
but the coffee machine hit by ransomware

1177
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,000
now i want to be very

1178
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,280
clear i don't i'm sorry i'm totally

1179
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,960
blanking on the guy's name

1180
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,920
that did this work i i apologize to the

1181
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,640
person

1182
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,720
i just don't remember the name um but

1183
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,480
but

1184
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,440
just over a month ago uh the news

1185
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,599
started bringing up this is a screenshot

1186
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:30,079
of

1187
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,240
forbes.com notice i have one of four

1188
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,000
free articles now used

1189
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,200
uh but um

1190
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,720
i didn't even notice that was on the

1191
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,800
bottom of the screenshot when i took it

1192
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,680
that's awful

1193
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,160
i'm cheap but

1194
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,640
this was actually pretty neat a pretty

1195
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,520
neat attack

1196
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,240
it was a pretty neat proof of concept

1197
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,160
the person found a coffee machine

1198
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,359
that was smart right which i'll be blunt

1199
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,800
i don't want a smart coffee machine

1200
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,640
why because i don't want any risk that

1201
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,319
somebody's going to mess up my ability

1202
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,920
to get coffee

1203
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,760
critical critical but he realized

1204
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,359
that what he could do is he could take

1205
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,240
apart this machine and he could

1206
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,079
insert stuff he could run code

1207
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,240
on the coffee machine including

1208
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,359
ransomware

1209
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,880
and he could hijack the patching process

1210
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,119
possibly and do this and everything else

1211
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,319
like that and it

1212
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,599
went nuts bonkers

1213
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,000
okay oh man iot is failing like but

1214
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,640
but it's coffee machine like it's this

1215
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,240
is not a widespread attack

1216
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,800
this is not something that is going to

1217
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,760


1218
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,119
health care which we can rant about that

1219
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,720
in a second also right

1220
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,839
i did on the podcast last week with tom

1221
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:54,800
eston

1222
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,800
um but we see this attention

1223
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,079
to interesting attacks

1224
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,920
and let me be very clear ransomware

1225
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,280
running on my coffee machine

1226
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,800
would piss me off and as such

1227
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,079
it's critical that we fix it but the

1228
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,040
reality is

1229
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,760
it did not need to be on cnn it did not

1230
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,720
need to be

1231
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,319
on the bbc

1232
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,000
i didn't need to get phone calls from

1233
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
customers worried

1234
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,599
about the coffee pot ransomware threat

1235
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,319
and yes i got those calls just like i

1236
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:30,640
got

1237
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,880
calls for the teapot that was broken

1238
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,000
into a decade ago

1239
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,280
we see this waste of people's

1240
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,440
time and i don't mean the work to see if

1241
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,119
ransomware would do it i mean the

1242
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,319
attention

1243
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,880
and ridiculous clickbait articles that

1244
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,160
talk about it

1245
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,400
and security builds it up we

1246
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,280
encourage more and more attention to

1247
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,800
these things

1248
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,240
yet we are not fixing fundamental

1249
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,839
problems users are still clicking links

1250
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,000
why not because they're stupid but

1251
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,920
because technology and security have

1252
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,280
developed the systems

1253
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,839
to require them to click the links how

1254
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,839
many of you do a user awareness training

1255
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:14,240
class

1256
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,400
every single year probably most if not

1257
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,880
all of you how many of you

1258
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,640
who are responsible for running those

1259
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,160
classes send out an

1260
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,560
email with a link that the user clicks

1261
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,480
on to take the class it tells them not

1262
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,520
to click links

1263
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,839
we don't understand the reality of what

1264
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,520
we're fighting against

1265
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,400
we have not looked at what the systems

1266
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,000
really are vulnerable to and which

1267
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,359
vulnerabilities matter

1268
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,280
and i can prove it because i will tell

1269
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,800
you right now pci

1270
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,200
is still failing people over ssl

1271
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,240
self-signed certificates

1272
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,560
we're still making oh man you're running

1273
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,280
tls

1274
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,800
1.1 critical finding you fail

1275
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,680
even though i have for decades

1276
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,640
asked people for examples of real-world

1277
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,680
breaches that were

1278
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,800
caused because somebody ran ssl 3.0

1279
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,240
and i'm not saying they don't exist i'm

1280
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,680
saying i've never found them i've never

1281
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,680
been given them and i've asked forever

1282
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,960
we yell at people for ssl configs of

1283
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,920
their printers

1284
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,079
and ignore the fact that they're running

1285
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,960
windows 7.

1286
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,119
we ignore the fact that they have active

1287
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,400
directory and smb

1288
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,480
exposed to the internet but oh my god

1289
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,880
ssl

1290
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,160
by the way every single one of those is

1291
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,680
real examples from tests we've done

1292
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,680
we have to understand the reality of

1293
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,040
what we're doing and we have to be

1294
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,079
honest

1295
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,040
about what we're talking about and then

1296
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,680
the last thing

1297
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:53,520
is understanding goals

1298
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,760
we have to understand that not everybody

1299
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,920
has the same goal we do

1300
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,520
now in some cases the goals are similar

1301
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,160
we all want a job we all want to retire

1302
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,920
well we all want to have fun and good

1303
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,160
times and be happy

1304
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,760
and be with our loved ones but what are

1305
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,720
the goals

1306
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,440
of security well in many cases is to be

1307
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,000
secure

1308
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,760
and what's funny about that goal is

1309
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,119
we're never going to accomplish it

1310
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,440
the idea that somebody is 100 secure is

1311
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,559
so laughably ludicrous

1312
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,079
that when i hear companies say to me

1313
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,000
that's our security goal

1314
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,480
i recognize the fact that this is going

1315
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,359
to be a difficult engagement

1316
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:36,640
because we go back to reality and

1317
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,880
understanding right

1318
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,640
and obviously we failed to communicate

1319
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,480
the idea that you can't be

1320
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,839
100 secure technology has a completely

1321
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,440
different goal

1322
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,119
right security wants to be secured they

1323
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:50,480
want to protect the data

1324
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,960
protect access protect the systems they

1325
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,319
want to do the right thing and don't get

1326
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,040
me wrong

1327
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,160
that's awesome do you know what it's

1328
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,280
goal is

1329
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,800
uptime that's why

1330
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,280
slas exist 99.999

1331
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,720
yeah right right

1332
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,480
it wants to be available they want it to

1333
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,000
be running and

1334
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,240
i always find it funny that security

1335
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,920
always seems to forget that

1336
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,440
a is part of the cia triad availability

1337
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:21,920
is

1338
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,960
just as important in the triad as

1339
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,960
confidentiality and integrity

1340
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,160
now the use case the example of the

1341
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:30,880
business

1342
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,079
the exact scenario those three

1343
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,680
change based on the goals

1344
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,880
of who the business that's the one

1345
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,680
everybody else should be paying

1346
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,880
attention to

1347
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,520
right and bluntly technology gets that

1348
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,280
better than security does in many many

1349
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,720
cases

1350
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,240
and i would argue that that's because

1351
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,839
technology's been beat over the head by

1352
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,000
it for years and security somehow lives

1353
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,359
in this ivory tower that we don't have

1354
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,880
to worry about that kind of stuff

1355
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,480
oh no i'm sorry i'm security we got to

1356
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,079
do this i don't care about the business

1357
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,280
goals

1358
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,200
you understand right i love it i have

1359
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,319
this argument on twitter every once in a

1360
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:04,720
while

1361
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,680
because you know that's the best place

1362
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,319
to have arguments right sms two-factor

1363
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,160
authentication is fundamentally broken

1364
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,440
and should be recommended against

1365
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,880
every single place and if you're working

1366
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,640
with an organization that's using sms

1367
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,920
two-factor authentication you should

1368
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,520
burn in hell

1369
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,079
that's what we hear on twitter the

1370
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,119
reality is

1371
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,480
in my opinion my opinion

1372
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,680
that in the vast majority of cases the

1373
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,000
vast majority of organizations

1374
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,880
sms two-factor authentication is better

1375
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,200
than nothing

1376
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,920
it's better than what they had and it's

1377
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,280
a step in the right direction

1378
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,040
but as long as we yell from the

1379
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,280
mountaintops

1380
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,520
you plea running sms two-factor

1381
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,119
authentication

1382
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,720
do you not understand their goal their

1383
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,280
goal is to build a system that works

1384
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,800
with the people

1385
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,880
they need to work with because here's

1386
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,520
the funny part about sms two factor

1387
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,200
and i and i don't remember the exact

1388
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,839
statistic but you know that 83.5 percent

1389
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,200
of all statistics are made up on the

1390
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,520
spot

1391
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,160
something like 80 percent of the cell

1392
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,280
phones

1393
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,960
worldwide don't support

1394
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,079
running applications on them they can't

1395
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:16,640
run

1396
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,440
google authenticator they can't run

1397
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,280
authy

1398
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,720
what they can do is receive an sms text

1399
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,839
so if we tell them that their only

1400
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,680
choice

1401
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,800
is to upgrade their phone

1402
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,280
they're not going to do it they're gonna

1403
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,440
turn off two-factor

1404
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,920
and if your business is to work with

1405
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,119
people

1406
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,040
that are worldwide i i went down to

1407
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,480
miami and i spoke at an event last year

1408
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,960
that was talking about the unbanked

1409
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,119
which was a term that at the time

1410
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,839
i had not heard and it was fascinating i

1411
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,119
sat at this conference i want to be very

1412
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,040
clear that wasn't what i was speaking on

1413
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,359
i was speaking on security but i sat at

1414
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,160
this conference and i

1415
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,520
heard all these things about working

1416
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,680
with the unbanked and these are people

1417
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,559
who just

1418
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,960
for a variety of reasons don't have bank

1419
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,160
accounts

1420
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,480
they don't have access to the stuff that

1421
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,119
i take for granted

1422
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,839
i don't even think about put on a credit

1423
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:19,200
card transfer money do this

1424
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,319
i'm gonna go to the bank and deal with i

1425
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:21,520
don't have to go to the bank i get on my

1426
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,040
phone

1427
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,160
i can transfer money this way

1428
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,079
but the unbanked doesn't have access to

1429
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,680
that

1430
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,760
and as security we should be paying

1431
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,960
attention to the fact

1432
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,440
that our organization may be working in

1433
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,720
that market

1434
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,240
and if they are then decrying

1435
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,240
sms two-factor authentication as

1436
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,480
horrible and bad and shouldn't be there

1437
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,319
it's probably not the right thing for us

1438
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,319
to do and it's because we've lost sight

1439
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,240
of what the business's goals are

1440
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,040
because the business's goal is not to be

1441
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,960
secure that's not their goal they want

1442
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,640
to be secure they want to be as secure

1443
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,839
as they can be their goal

1444
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:03,839
is to do business

1445
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,960
do we understand that so how do we fix

1446
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:07,920
it

1447
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,240
well i think there's three things to

1448
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,640
talk about

1449
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,520
we have to be honest i want to be very

1450
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,079
clear

1451
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,720
that's a big one to me right if you're

1452
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,480
not being honest

1453
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,839
then nothing else matters right so

1454
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,200
that's core it really should be the

1455
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,119
bottom of the pyramid but

1456
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,880
that's the order i did them in let's go

1457
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,960
with it right

1458
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,079
but we have to be honest about what

1459
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:33,359
we're talking about we have to be honest

1460
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:34,800
about what the risk really is

1461
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,119
and let's be very clear that if we're if

1462
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:38,240
we're

1463
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,480
not understanding the actual risk it

1464
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,680
doesn't matter how well

1465
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,079
we're honest if we don't understand it

1466
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:44,880
right

1467
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,640
we have to communicate well

1468
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,200
and something i struggle with is

1469
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,319
remembering

1470
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:57,839
that communication is mostly listening

1471
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,240
i've always heard god gave you two ears

1472
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,160
and one mouth for a reason

1473
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,920
because you're supposed to listen twice

1474
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,000
as much as you speak

1475
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,200
i would argue you probably should listen

1476
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,839
more than that

1477
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:15,200
talk to people recognize that we

1478
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,760
shouldn't have called it talking

1479
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,960
we should be hearing people listening

1480
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,079
to people if you're a security person or

1481
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:25,680
a business person or an i.t person i

1482
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,839
don't care but especially scary people

1483
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,440
are the ones i'm yelling at right now

1484
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,760
have you gone to the staff meetings

1485
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,400
of the groups you work with have you

1486
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,400
gone to the staff meetings of the groups

1487
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,000
in your organization that you have

1488
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,839
nothing to do with

1489
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,920
have you ever reached out to hr and said

1490
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,880
hey

1491
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,799
i got an idea how about i come to your

1492
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:54,160
morning meeting not to present

1493
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,880
not to talk about security but to hear

1494
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,319
what you're worried about

1495
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,079
to hear what you're working on day to

1496
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,240
day if you're an apsec guy

1497
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:05,599
have you gone and talked to the

1498
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,799
developers and found out no again

1499
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,480
not to tell them why you're important

1500
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,440
and why your security is so critical

1501
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,559
but understand what she's working on

1502
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,720
hear what she's working deadlines for

1503
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,160
what they

1504
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:25,200
are dealing with every day

1505
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,879
did you sit with them and find out

1506
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,680
and are we communicating or are we

1507
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,599
talking at people

1508
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,640
because we talk at lots of people we

1509
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,680
really do

1510
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,079
uh we see it all the time you know i got

1511
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:41,839
an idea let me rant on twitter about it

1512
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:42,480
let me

1513
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,480
send an email let me post it on our

1514
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,119
internal sharepoint whatever

1515
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,640
we talk at people constantly and i'm not

1516
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,319
saying that the posters telling people

1517
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,000
not to click links are a waste of time

1518
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,319
they're a waste of time

1519
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,880
i'm not saying the poster talking about

1520
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,720
the owasp asvs

1521
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,760
is a bad idea but we need to stop

1522
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,280
talking at people

1523
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,079
we need to start communicating okay so

1524
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,240
we've got a few more minutes i believe

1525
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,079
for the time i'm going to try to get

1526
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:13,599
switched over to

1527
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,400
discord to see if there's questions and

1528
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,359
stuff like that i

1529
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:20,559
um jumping around i'm sorry

1530
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,200
um wasn't even in the right channel

1531
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,240
that's great

1532
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,280
um i didn't see any questions kevin okay

1533
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:27,920
good

1534
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,680
and i'm glad to see that the images were

1535
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,079
killing somebody gone

1536
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:34,160
that's me actually and they were painful

1537
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,280
in times

1538
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,440
good good okay so i said that i wasn't

1539
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,799
going to mention it but nobody has

1540
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:41,599
commented on you

1541
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,520

from here

1543
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,520

1544
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:59,040
we put it on chewy this morning

1545
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,880

1548
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,280
captain picard that's that's terrible i

1549
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,520
you know

1550
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:16,400
your talk is very timely though i don't

1551
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,440
know if you're on earlier when i'm

1552
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,240
starting i've

1553
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,520
i've moved from security into a cso role

1554
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,440
a director of information security in a

1555
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,880
fortune 1000

1556
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,000
it's a different tool set yes

1557
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,240
i i don't do powershell anymore and in

1558
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,400
fact

1559
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,079
at your powerpoint exactly what i said i

1560
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,359
said i'm trading in powershell for

1561
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:37,280
powerpoint

1562
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,720
most programming i'm going to do is

1563
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,319
power bi to generate

1564
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:42,960
metrics to but not operational metrics

1565
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,400
and it's it's killing my head

1566
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,680
i don't communicate well i'm so sorry

1567
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,920
in that board level because i'm like how

1568
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,119
do i convince

1569
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,440
them that this is the right thing and

1570
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,799
and i'll tell this story real quick

1571
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:56,079
because i only got a couple of minutes i

1572
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,280
used to be a director of it at a law

1573
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,160
firm and it

1574
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,720
plays directly into your your slides i

1575
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,480
got to ask the question

1576
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,000
i want to put my laptop on the wireless

1577
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,160
network and what did i say

1578
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,920
no no yeah he asked me a question

1579
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,680
but it wasn't what he i didn't

1580
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,720
understand why i didn't take the moment

1581
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,640
to ask why yes he just understood i went

1582
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,400
on the network and i said no you can't

1583
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,599
be on the network that's a policy

1584
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,839
violation

1585
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,720
instead of asking him i'm done yeah why

1586
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,280
exactly

1587
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,680
now now i have to go back and go no what

1588
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,760
are you what are you trying to achieve

1589
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,200
well i want to get updates so i can

1590
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,720
check my bank account and so on and so

1591
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,640
forth i'm like oh so you went on the

1592
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,559
guest network not the internal network

1593
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,839
yep and this that's a great example

1594
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,240
and we see it all the time and like i

1595
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,359
said at the very beginning

1596
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:49,440
i'm as much at fault for doing this type

1597
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,280
of stuff as anybody else's

1598
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,799
right i hear what i think they mean

1599
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:58,480
and i respond to that right not

1600
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,079
what they asked and

1601
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:04,640
i hope that people enjoyed the talk even

1602
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,599
if

1603
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,040
the pictures were like nails on a

1604
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,119
chalkboard i'm gonna go find some of

1605

00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,680
um participation that's actually how we

1616
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,160
met i met you you you're in a clone

1617
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,760
trooper outfit at derby i believe yes

1618
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,520
yes i don't have that clone trooper

1619
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,200
anymore i sold him

1620
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,000
uh and not to me which is probably an

1621
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,040
oversight

1622
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,160
did you you ask for it no i did not so

1623
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,559
no i i wouldn't assume anything that

1624
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,640
spectacular would be for sale

1625
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,400
but well in this case um i

1626
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,079
wanted to do some other stuff i wanted

1627
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,000
to build chewy and uh

1628
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,319
so i basically sold him for what i i

1629
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:01,200
bought him for

1630
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,359
um most of the time the costumes are not

1631
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:04,400
for sale

1632
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,040
outside of the org uh very rarely will

1633
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:07,839
you see

1634
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:09,839
an actual there are people who make them

1635
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,920
the guy that made my mouth so i made

1636
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,799
with a doug a guy here he helped me we

1637
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,160
made everything from here

1638
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,319
down the mask i bought from a guy in

1639
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:19,760
ireland and that guy sells

1640
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,200
full costumes but they're more expensive

1641
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,160
than i think they

1642
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,520
they range about 7 000 for the full

1643
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,280
and i i built him for 1500.

1644
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,640
so i am working on a bb-8

1645
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,119
