1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,320
thank you so much um thank you everyone

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,120
it's great to be

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,560
with you with information

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,240
countermeasures

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,040
my name is ali mellen i'm a security

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,000
strategist

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,559
i've been in tech for the past 10 years

8
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,120
i'm a computer engineer by training

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,359
and um i've spent a lot of time

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,199
doing a lot of various engineering and

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,960
tech roles over that 10 years

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,599
but more recently i've been working in

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,039
the security space

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,279
i've presented my research at places

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,199
like black hat and defcon

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,239
and hope um and now secure

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,399
wb and um over the past two years in

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,920
particular i've been working very

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,600
closely with the fbi

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,800
secret service dhs and

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,200
local and state law enforcement in order

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,920
to

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,239
test the security of our elections in

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,760
order to make it better

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,520
and so this has been done through

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,199
tabletop exercises

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,600
where we put hackers against law

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,520
enforcement and government officials

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,719
in order to really see what processes

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,440
are in place

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,400
and how effective they are so it's not a

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,080
lot of hands-on hacking

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,680
but it's actually looking at the

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,439
processes that the government has in

35
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,600
place seeing how prepared they are

36
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,240
and seeing if what different things

37
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,000
attackers could do that they might not

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,200
be prepared for

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,040
and this is all about the things that

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,360
are really surrounding the election

41
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,200
it's not so much limited to just those

42
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,960
voting machines but really

43
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,200
what else can someone do to suppress the

44
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,000
vote or to

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,600
affect the election

46
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,280
but before we really dive into that i

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,960
want to start by talking about what's

48
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,000
truly critical

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,079
to our daily lives because it's really

50
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,360
way more connected than we think

51
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,520
and of course the first thing that we

52
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,040
think of when we think of

53
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,000
what's critical to our daily life is

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,799
maslow's hierarchy of needs

55
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,600
maslow's hierarchy of needs is a pyramid

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,520
that represents all of the things that

57
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,079
we as

58
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,600
individuals need in order to achieve

59
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,560
self-actualization and really that

60
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,600
ability to be the best that we can be

61
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,119
at the bottom layer you have the

62
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,038
physiological needs these are things

63
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:11,760
like

64
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,440
air water food the really important

65
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,360
things that you need just to

66
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,959
be a human being on the next level we

67
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:21,280
have

68
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,360
safety this is things like personal

69
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,319
security

70
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,480
employment and resources you really

71
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,760
can't achieve

72
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,239
the top of that pyramid without safety

73
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,640
next and this one is critical comes to

74
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,599
belonging

75
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,000
things like friendship and intimacy

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,760
really that sense of connection that you

77
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,519
have with others in the community and

78
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,840
others in the world

79
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,720
above that is esteem of course that

80
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,519
self-respect that respect from others

81
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,560
status and recognition and again all of

82
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,040
this is leading up to self-actualization

83
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,080
and you can't have self-actualization

84
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,000
without all these other layers of the

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,680
pyramid

86
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,760
so where does voting fit into this why

87
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,360
is this important in the context of

88
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,959
voting

89
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,640
that's what we're going to talk about

90
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,159
but more

91
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,200
i want to break down things like the

92
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,640
defender perspective

93
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,760
and the daily life of a voter as well as

94
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,959
diving into

95
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,519
what the attacker perspective really

96
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,159
looks like

97
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,000
so we can take that information and

98
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,519
think about it in the context

99
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,920
of what you could do to both stop an

100
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,440
election and how we can use that to

101
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,040
protect an election because that's

102
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,080
what's really important

103
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,599
and that's what we're looking to get out

104
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,680
of both of these exercises that i've

105
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,480
done

106
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,519
but also as individuals how can we

107
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,799
contribute to election security

108
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,239
so let's dive into the defender

109
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,560
perspective get a good overview

110
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
of how we got here and what that looks

111
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,120
like so that we can really understand

112
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,720
how we can best attack that

113
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,840
so according to the dhs election

114
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,439
infrastructure

115
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,200
includes all of the things like voter

116
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,879
registration databases

117
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,560
associated i.t systems um

118
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,120
voting systems polling places all of

119
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,480
these things that are really about

120
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,080
counting the votes but what i

121
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,798
am thinking of as i think of the

122
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,720
maslow's hierarchy of needs

123
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,440
is is that really all that there is to

124
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,040
ensuring election security

125
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,759
and i don't think that it is in fact i

126
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,800
think that

127
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,280
much more than that we need to consider

128
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,400
what i call the voter hierarchy of needs

129
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,520
and this is really a pyramid

130
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,320
of things that are critical for

131
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,800
individual citizens before they feel

132
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,479
comfortable voting

133
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,800
and it aligns really closely to maslow's

134
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,160
hierarchy of needs

135
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,800
in order to show the real connection

136
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,280
that

137
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,160
voting has and people's willingness to

138
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,440
vote has

139
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,560
with um the existing systems

140
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,639
that are related to their daily lives

141
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,240
so it starts with things like the

142
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,919
physiological needs

143
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,080
of course we're talking about if you

144
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,360
don't feel safe

145
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,800
if you don't if you feel like your life

146
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,280
is at risk because you don't have enough

147
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,000
food

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,720
for example you're much less likely to

149
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,240
make the decision to go out and vote

150
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,440
similarly if you don't feel safe

151
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,639
if you feel at risk because someone in

152
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,000
is um trying to hurt you or

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,160
for example you don't feel financially

154
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,360
secure

155
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,759
you have other priorities that may be

156
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,880
more important than going to vote

157
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,360
another great example a really important

158
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,560
example that we're seeing

159
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,880
time and time again be really critical

160
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,120
to people actually choosing to go vote

161
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,320
is belonging and it's really all about

162
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,199
that belief system and it's also about

163
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,440
feeling like you belong in the community

164
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,120
and like you have a connection to the

165
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,000
country that you are part of

166
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,560
and then of course esteem feeling like

167
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,600
your vote matters

168
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,840
feeling like you have a voice in the

169
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,800
country that you are

170
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,440
in and ultimately leading to

171
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,840
self-actualization

172
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,319
and we're talking about

173
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,240
self-actualization not just for yourself

174
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,560
but for your country as well you want

175
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,000
your country to be the best

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,840
it can be when you feel that sense of

177
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,080
belonging when you feel connected

178
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,479
to the country that you're in so all of

179
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,080
these are critical in order

180
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,199
to really make sure that individual

181
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,240
citizens

182
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,400
feel compelled to go vote feel safe

183
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,520
going to vote

184
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,800
and are not um

185
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,639
able to be suppressed by another group

186
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,080
of people

187
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,680
so this is why when i think about

188
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,440
election infrastructure

189
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,319
i think that having a narrow definition

190
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,319
that really just encompasses

191
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,440
the physical infrastructure associated

192
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,360
with actually collecting the votes

193
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,240
is far too limited and that's not to say

194
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,720
that

195
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,720
governments or um election committees

196
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,080
should be in charge of a bunch of other

197
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,759
facets that contribute to this

198
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,520
but they should be thinking about it

199
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,039
they should have a plan in place they

200
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,960
should have partners associated with it

201
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,639
so they're more prepared

202
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,240
to handle these types of election

203
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,400
threats because

204
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,520
all of these layers these become systems

205
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,680
to that we really need to protect

206
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,440
in order to ensure the integrity of the

207
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,039
vote because they are

208
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,479
all layers that can be a target

209
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,560
and we're going to go through a lot of

210
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,840
these different all of these different

211
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,039
layers actually

212
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,960
to see different ways that you can

213
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,120
attack these layers

214
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,319
in order to affect an election

215
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,919
and it's particularly stark when you see

216
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,319
that

217
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,800
40 percent of eligible us citizens

218
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,560
choose not to vote at all

219
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,680
we're already down 40 of people

220
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,080
so any um bit of election interference

221
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,639
or any bit of election meddling or

222
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,360
tampering

223
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,599
can have a really large impact when

224
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,360
you're already missing so much of the

225
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,680
vote

226
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,560
so when i think about election

227
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,039
infrastructure i'm really thinking about

228
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,520
three core elements things like

229
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,680
maintaining faith in democracy

230
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,800
which is critical for nations that

231
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,400
support the vote

232
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,120
the second is all about preventing voter

233
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,240
suppression

234
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,440
which could be done on a domestic or

235
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,159
international scale depending and the

236
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,958
third

237
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,279
national security because again if you

238
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,240
don't feel safe

239
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,080
if you feel like your life is at risk

240
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,919
because another country is interfering

241
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,440
with your election

242
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
you're most likely not going to go vote

243
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,720
you're going to

244
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,800
start to see a crumbling of people's

245
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,560
belief in the country

246
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,399
and willingness to contribute to the

247
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,800
country

248
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,440
so now i want to dive into the attacker

249
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,120
perspective now that we have

250
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,760
that point of view and really i want you

251
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,560
guys to start brainstorming as well

252
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,480
what the attacker perspective might look

253
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,880
like in the modern day given what you

254
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,440
know

255
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,920
about our election system given how you

256
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,200
go to vote

257
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,480
and i want to emphasize that

258
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
this is an evil and i think that a lot

259
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,839
of us know that a lot of us in the

260
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,279
security space which

261
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,680
pretty sure is most of the people here

262
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,519
we know that this isn't evil

263
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,240
we know that this is why we read team

264
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,760
this is what's so important is that

265
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,560
we're able to

266
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,120
understand the attacker mindset so that

267
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,040
we can really use that

268
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,440
to make the systems that we have in

269
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,480
place better

270
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,080
so please keep in mind as we go through

271
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,600
this that

272
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
there's no need to demonize people who

273
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,519
do look for

274
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,880
um what threats could be effective

275
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,720
because really it is just meant to make

276
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,839
us stronger

277
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,360
so when we're thinking about the

278
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,760
attacker they typically have

279
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,399
three motivations the first is of course

280
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,000
to gain power

281
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,160
a lot of um especially at the nation

282
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,040
state level

283
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,120
these are going to be the three core

284
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,720
ones that we're thinking about with the

285
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,120
second

286
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,240
being spreading a particular ideology we

287
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,560
saw this a lot and during the cold war

288
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,079
between um uh

289
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,720
the soviet union in the united states

290
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,160
and we'll get into some of that a little

291
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,040
bit later

292
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,200
and then the last is really maintaining

293
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
that global recognition

294
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,399
and support we see a lot of countries

295
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,920
using attacks on people's elections and

296
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,959
tax on their government

297
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,519
in order to really maintain their global

298
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,959
recognition and support

299
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,880
especially as a superpower

300
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,880
when i think about attacks specifically

301
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,000
cyber attacks to

302
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,560
anything whether it's elections or not i

303
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,000
think about them in three different

304
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,120
layers the first

305
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
is the infrastructure layer that's all

306
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,040
the physical components that people are

307
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,320
actually attacking

308
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,480
this is what makes a cyber attack have a

309
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,640
kinetic impact the second

310
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,800
is that information plane this is really

311
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
playing off of what people

312
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,519
know to be true giving them quote

313
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,399
unquote facts

314
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,800
that aren't true whether you do it

315
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,720
intentionally or not

316
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,000
and the last is the ethos plane

317
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,160
this is targeting that belief system

318
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,640
this is where we really start to see

319
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,720
things like democracy things like

320
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
governments and the foundations that

321
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,680
they're built on

322
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,839
start to crumble when people target the

323
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,200
actual belief system

324
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,279
of a country the belief system of the

325
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,640
individuals

326
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,600
and turn these individuals against the

327
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,279
government or against the community

328
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,600
so i want to start by looking at some

329
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,279
historical examples

330
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,320
of attacks on that belief system plane

331
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,839
and we're going to look at some that

332
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,360
don't have a cyber component

333
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
as well as those that do and what's

334
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,200
important to note here is that

335
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,320
even though some of the historical um

336
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,040
examples don't have a cyber component

337
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,360
they

338
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,079
very easily could in modern day the only

339
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,200
reason that they don't

340
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,000
is because they're from so long ago so

341
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,320
and

342
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,959
there wasn't the option then so when you

343
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,079
think about this

344
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,680
another great thing to think about as we

345
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,920
go through these is how much easier

346
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,040
these types of attacks would be if

347
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,800
people had access to the internet at the

348
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,639
time because

349
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,399
that's what we're really getting at here

350
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,120
is that these attacks are not new

351
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,800
they're just taking they're in a new

352
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
package and the package is

353
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,720
the internet so i want to start with the

354
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,240
italian elections of 1948.

355
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,360
in 1948 the u.s government

356
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,240
um and the soviet union was intent on

357
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,920
psychological warfare

358
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,079
the u.s was of course really pushing

359
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,680
democracy they were spending

360
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,200
millions of dollars both on

361
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,240
christian democratic parties but also

362
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,360
on the um on the

363
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,000
soviet union side really pushing the

364
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,040
right-wing socialist agenda

365
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,320
there was a massive propaganda campaign

366
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,760
against the communist socialist

367
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,079
coalition and the goal

368
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,880
on both sides was to really change the

369
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,399
perception of the election

370
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,120
even though these two countries are not

371
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,440
in

372
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,120
supposed to be involved with the

373
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,519
country's politics but they really

374
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,279
wanted to change the conversation

375
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,120
into a battle of democracy versus

376
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,519
totalitarianism

377
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,959
christianity versus atheism america

378
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,600
versus the soviet union and ultimately

379
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,959
what they really wanted is a

380
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,639
conversation about abundance

381
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,320
versus starvation and what was amazing

382
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,920
is this was so effective

383
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
that they ultimately repeated the

384
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,120
process

385
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,720
in guatemala in south vietnam

386
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,720
in afghanistan and indonesia

387
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,839
and many more

388
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,959
another example i want to talk about is

389
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,920
the 1996 chinese influence on the u.s

390
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,680
election now in 1996 a chinese general

391
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,279
interested in influencing the us

392
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,440
presidential election funneled

393
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,440
300 000 to the clinton campaign

394
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,639
now immediately you think well this is

395
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,320
um this money is funneled to

396
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,760
the clinton campaign because they want

397
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,160
the clinton campaign to win absolutely

398
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,160
however there's more to it than that

399
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,600
because ultimately

400
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,839
u.s citizens did find out about this and

401
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,199
this is the type of thing that makes

402
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,040
people start to lose faith

403
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,600
in their government and belief that

404
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,639
their votes

405
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,040
and their money and their choices are

406
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,079
what are deciding

407
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,680
elections in this country

408
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,079
so now i want to take a look at some

409
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,760
modern day examples we're going to look

410
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,920
at examples from 2016

411
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,760
and i'm sure in a few weeks i'll have a

412
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,600
lot from this year

413
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,399
for you um but let's take a look at some

414
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,560
social media examples

415
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,800
on the right you can see a like and

416
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,480
share if you want the burka band in

417
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,120
america

418
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,880
stop all invaders this is a facebook

419
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,240
ad um a facebook post that's promoted

420
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,800
and it's really meant to push this

421
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,440
narrative

422
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,480
of there's conflict in the united states

423
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,680
we um have invaders quote unquote in

424
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,240
america

425
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,839
and this is someone who feels that way

426
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,839
who is american however

427
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,880
the reality looks very different this is

428
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,320
not a um site that is

429
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,519
or a group that is actually a group of

430
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,320
americans

431
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,720
this is a group of people who is looking

432
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,720
to spread disinformation in the country

433
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,680
and to cause

434
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,959
chaos and ultimately conflict on the

435
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:47,519
left

436
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,759
you can see a great example as well from

437
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,959
twitter

438
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,600
which is supposedly a very helpful

439
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,680
notice from the clinton campaign

440
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,639
saying vote from home text hillary to

441
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,160
this number and

442
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,320
you'll be able to vote now this could be

443
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,000
a very compelling message to a lot of

444
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,880
people especially right now

445
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,519
when tensions are high you don't

446
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,680
necessarily want to do mail-in voting

447
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,199
you don't necessarily want to go into

448
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,519
the polls because of the pandemic

449
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,240
there's a lot of confusion and conflict

450
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,600
caused by this

451
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,839
and so having a texting option would be

452
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,839
very convenient it looks very official

453
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,000
it has hillary on it it has her campaign

454
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,199
logo in the corner

455
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,720
but in reality this is not an actual

456
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,360
way to vote of course it's not a way

457
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,240
that you can vote

458
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,120
it is from someone who is obviously

459
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,480
trying to

460
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,880
mess with people and trying to make sure

461
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,720
that certain people's votes don't count

462
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,959
and luckily

463
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,160
we have seen over the past few months

464
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,240
many social media companies start to

465
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,160
step up in some capacity

466
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,199
to address these problems

467
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,519
however we still have quotes like these

468
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,480
from some

469
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,160
where they're talking about how this is

470
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,599
a free speech issue

471
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,280
and how this is not something that they

472
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,959
can control because they don't want to

473
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,679
police individuals on their platforms

474
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,319
however one thing that i hope will

475
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,919
become clear throughout the course of

476
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:16,959
this talk

477
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,400
is that election security is everyone's

478
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,199
problem

479
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,280
it is not just the government's problem

480
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,319
it is not just

481
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,000
businesses problems it's not just social

482
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,919
media companies problems

483
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,400
it is for a problem for all of us to

484
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,120
address

485
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,320
and we need to do what we know is right

486
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,840
and what we know is the most

487
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,640
reasonable and beneficial way to

488
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,240
approach the situation

489
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,160
and framing this as a free speech issue

490
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,360
is not benefiting

491
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,039
the community and the country that

492
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,400
you're a part of

493
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,440
and i don't mean to say that we should

494
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,960
um oppress certain groups or not talk

495
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
about what certain groups are saying

496
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,720
but we need a solution that addresses

497
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
fake information being put out there and

498
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,559
we need it at the business level we need

499
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,080
it at the government level we need it at

500
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,280
the individual level

501
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,600
we need to work together to find a

502
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,320
better solution

503
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,720
so let's dive into the information plane

504
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,400
and this is all

505
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,160
of those things that um those fake

506
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,039
fake comments you see online um those

507
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:27,440
fake

508
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,160
videos get deca posted online and i want

509
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,919
to start with a historical example

510
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:32,400
that's

511
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,840
personally really important to me

512
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,600
because i didn't even know about it for

513
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,640
a long time

514
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,240
you certainly didn't hear this growing

515
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,000
up but

516
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,200
the foundations of america and

517
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,559
that really starts with sam

518
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,919
adams which is crazy to think about but

519
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,000
ultimately america was founded on the

520
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,840
premise of a conspiracy theory

521
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,919
where the british were trying to enslave

522
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,039
us sam

523
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,200
adams argued britain's taxations were

524
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,600
part of an elaborate conspiracy to

525
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
eventually enslave american

526
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,720
colonists he actually spread that and

527
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,320
other early disinformation through

528
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,000
pamphlets and speeches

529
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,840
that had information that he knew was

530
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,760
untrue and he actually

531
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,640
used the boston massacre to further that

532
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,400
message

533
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,200
so when we think about disinformation

534
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,440
and we talk about it in the context of a

535
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
oh this is being spread so quickly

536
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,120
through social media

537
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,080
in reality this is not a new problem

538
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,520
this is a human problem

539
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,039
and this is something that we've seen

540
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,679
for as long as the country that i'm

541
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,799
a part of has been here and

542
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,760
probably much longer and so instead of

543
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,440
thinking about it as a

544
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,000
this is a problem with social media's

545
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,039
virality

546
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,440
or this is a problem with people posting

547
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,360
things without having to back them up

548
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,360
we need to think about this as the

549
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,039
actual human problem that it is

550
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,760
another great example and this one i

551
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,640
actually

552
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,679
find very interesting is the cia

553
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,080
and the propaganda asset inventory so in

554
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,039
the 50s

555
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,480
60s um and early 70s

556
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,600
during the cold war era we

557
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,880
saw the cia have a massive propaganda

558
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,240
asset inventory they had

559
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,720
so many newspapers and radio stations

560
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,600
and

561
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
all of magazines all of those different

562
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,039
things that they were using to spread

563
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,039
propaganda across the world

564
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,280
and i'm going to call out two specific

565
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,720
examples that i think are very

566
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,760
interesting the first

567
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,440
being radio free asia so radio free asia

568
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,760
was a radio station controlled by the

569
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,000
cia that was used to spread propaganda

570
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,760
specifically targeting different asian

571
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,799
countries

572
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,000
and at the time they realized that the

573
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,720
average

574
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,679
citizen of taiwan probably did not have

575
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,880
a radio

576
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,480
because it just wasn't it wasn't

577
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,240
something that had taken hold

578
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,440
in that area yet they weren't

579
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,280
technologically there the whole nine

580
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,159
yards

581
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,200
so what they did to address that problem

582
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,600
was they strapped balloons with small

583
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,480
radios

584
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,159
and tried to fly them over to taiwan

585
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,720
needless to say that did not work the

586
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,159
wind changed direction and took them

587
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:12,960
away

588
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,440
but it's an interesting example of how

589
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,000
before

590
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,280
we had really the internet that we do

591
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,799
today

592
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,200
they were trying to get propaganda to

593
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,880
these people to get disinformation to

594
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,360
these people ultimately

595
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,960
the second one that i find really

596
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
interesting is a magazine called

597
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,280
the forum world features this was

598
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,480
magazine again

599
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,240
where the cia was placing

600
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,520
propaganda articles unfortunately

601
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,000
the magazine became so popular that it

602
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,919
was also distributed to the

603
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,640
uh to the us ultimately and so the cia

604
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
had to be very careful

605
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
not to place false stories in the u.s

606
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,600
version only in the other versions

607
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,000
so two very interesting stories about

608
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,960
how the

609
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,120
logistics that go behind trying to

610
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,440
um put disinformation in the areas that

611
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,400
will benefit

612
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,720
the country that you're working for

613
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,840
another great example is the u.s radio

614
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,039
in moscow

615
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,960
from the from 1976 to 1982

616
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,159
um rock music was really popular

617
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,600
in russia but um not very accessible

618
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,840
and the only way that you could get it

619
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,159
was through a radio station controlled

620
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:30,640
by

621
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,200
the cia and they actually so they would

622
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,679
play

623
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,440
rock music like elton john and the

624
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,600
beatles and they would follow it up with

625
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,760
editorial content quote-unquote which

626
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,200
soviet authorities considered

627
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,320
disinformation

628
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,440
but it was the only station that people

629
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,200
in moscow could get

630
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,080
rock music on and so they continued to

631
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,559
to listen

632
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,080
now i want to give a more recent example

633
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,559
from

634
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,720
ukraine from the 2014 elections in

635
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,320
ukraine

636
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,600
now these elections were highly

637
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,960
contested

638
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,720
on the 21st of may in 2014 this is about

639
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,360
four days before the election

640
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,799
attackers actually were able to

641
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,799
compromise the cec network which is the

642
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,480
election commission network in

643
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,200
ukraine and they disabled the vote

644
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,840
counting

645
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,880
on that network so automatically this

646
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,760
can make people

647
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,440
really start to lose faith in their

648
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,960
government of course

649
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,039
and in their election what they did next

650
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,159
um even though so that compromise

651
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,640
it made the network go down for about 12

652
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,320
hours

653
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,840
but four days later on election day

654
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,240
because that was really just the start

655
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,679
um

656
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,279
the attackers started a continuous

657
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,640
denial of service attack

658
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,159
on that same cec website and 12 minutes

659
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,159
before polls closed

660
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,559
the attackers actually posted a picture

661
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,720
of the former leader of the right sector

662
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,520
on the cec website which is an official

663
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,559
website

664
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,200
claiming that this person won the

665
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,240
election

666
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,799
and that was then shared widely and

667
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,159
immediately

668
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,679
by russian media so this is fascinating

669
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,600
because to me especially because it

670
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,440
really feels like a combination

671
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,360
of different ways to attack a target

672
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,120
of course a few days before the election

673
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,960
you start to really degrade their faith

674
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,000
in the election

675
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,120
but then the day of you not only make it

676
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,799
very difficult for them to actually use

677
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,880
the website but you publish this

678
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,760
information

679
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,480
on this official website just 12 minutes

680
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,240
before the polls close

681
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,360
and then you use what

682
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,240
i think most people uh attribute to the

683
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,279
russians

684
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,320
you use your own social um your own

685
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,279
media networks

686
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,440
in order to share that information as

687
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:00,880
well and give it even more validity

688
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,080
and now i want to give some examples

689
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,400
of communications attacks which really

690
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,000
again target that information plane

691
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,520
and two examples come in the form of

692
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,279
text messages this is again

693
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,440
from the us presidential election in

694
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,559
2016.

695
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,159
on the right we have an example of how

696
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,080
um an individual citizen is receiving a

697
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,480
text message from someone claiming to be

698
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,279
associated with government and it says

699
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:31,600
you

700
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,039
vote at this um this address and the

701
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,600
hours to go vote are

702
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,679
6am to 9pm needless to say

703
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,840
this is not a legitimate polling place

704
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,080
it's it's not even a place that you can

705
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,279
go vote

706
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,279
so imagine being a citizen and getting

707
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,320
this message

708
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,960
that oh how convenient the government is

709
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,240
helping me get to

710
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,320
vote tomorrow and they're giving me the

711
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,559
address i don't even have to look it up

712
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,080
but it's not actually a polling place

713
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,679
and you go there

714
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,760
and you see that it's shut down it's not

715
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,120
an actual polling place

716
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,640
you're going to be frustrated you're not

717
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,640
necessarily going to want to go and find

718
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,760
the actual polling place and then on the

719
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,880
left

720
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,400
you have an example that's supposedly

721
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,480
from president trump saying you haven't

722
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,760
submitted your ballot yet

723
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,120
submit it here this is not um

724
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,640
this is not a message from president

725
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
trump or his campaign or anything like

726
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,200
that

727
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,080
but it is meant to shame people into

728
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,918
going to vote for a particular candidate

729
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,679
lastly we're going to talk about

730
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,679
infrastructure plane attacks

731
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,200
and these i find the most fascinating

732
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,080
because it really does have

733
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,400
the potential to impact our physical

734
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,120
realm through a cyber attack

735
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,159
but again we'll start with some

736
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,320
historical examples

737
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,240
and work our way to real life

738
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,919
i want to start with the assassination

739
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,360
of lumumba

740
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,559
this was um in the democratic republic

741
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,400
of the congo

742
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,600
the drc was actually

743
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,240
um made a independent nation in 1960

744
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,120
and the person that they that they

745
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,039
actually elected as prime minister

746
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,880
was lumumba so he elected him in 1960

747
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,000
they became an independent

748
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,559
nation in 1960 but then he was

749
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,760
assassinated

750
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,440
one year later in 1961.

751
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,360
now having your brand new prime minister

752
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,399
in your brand new nation be assassinated

753
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,159
would be politically fracturing

754
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,279
for any new country

755
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,080
but it's made even more so by the fact

756
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,880
that

757
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,520
he was actually assassinated by a

758
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,240
combination

759
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,320
of american and belgian governments

760
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,520
working together

761
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,600
to assassinate him because it didn't

762
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,120
meet to their interests

763
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,960
now imagine that you are

764
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,200
part of a brand new country you're

765
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,960
voting for the first time

766
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,320
as this comparably very small

767
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,399
country to a lot of countries in the

768
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,360
world and the person that you chose

769
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,200
to run your country is assassinated a

770
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,159
year later

771
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,919
by two superpowers these are the types

772
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,520
of things

773
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,799
that can really fracture a new nation

774
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,080
and really make them feel like their

775
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,840
votes don't even matter

776
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,240
because ultimately they're not the ones

777
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,799
in control

778
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,919
another example is

779
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,799
the indonesian elections and subsequent

780
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,080
massacre

781
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,120
so in 1965

782
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,279
the um communist party finished fourth

783
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,000
in indonesian elections and they were

784
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,080
offered a proportional representation in

785
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,760
the government

786
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,880
now this did not fit with u.s interests

787
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,799
and so they actually secretly supported

788
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,279
the purge of suspected communists and

789
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,360
thousands to millions of people died

790
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,360
over the course of months

791
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,279
ultimately the military took over as the

792
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,600
most powerful institution

793
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,919
now this is the type of thing that

794
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,880
obviously it

795
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,720
it kills people um on a massive scale

796
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,000
but it also terrifies the public who

797
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,559
is voting freely after this happens in

798
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,279
their country who is speaking freely

799
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,000
about their beliefs after this happens

800
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,360
in their country

801
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,679
and this was all through consistent

802
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,080
communication on the part of the u.s

803
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,320
to actual members of this country

804
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,120
and consistently making them feel like

805
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,399
the rest of the country was

806
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,919
with them like they needed to purge

807
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,880
the communists it was all through a

808
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,600
massive

809
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,840
disinformation campaign

810
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,799
another example more recent example is

811
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,360
the bronze night

812
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,840
though not on election day it's a very

813
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,039
good example of what

814
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,600
could happen and what has happened so

815
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,360
the bronze night

816
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,200
um is a night in estonia in 2007

817
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,000
when the estonians decided to move a red

818
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,279
army soldier

819
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,520
to a soviet cemetery because it was

820
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,320
previously

821
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,080
in the center of a town they didn't want

822
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,720
it there anymore for obvious reasons

823
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,880
um now immediately as they started to

824
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,159
move this statue

825
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,960
fake news began to spread especially

826
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,279
with russian news reports

827
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,440
they were all claiming that the statue

828
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,520
and the soviet war graves were being

829
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,240
destroyed

830
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,600
in mass this resulted in

831
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,240
two nights of riots and looting 156

832
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,399
people were injured one person died and

833
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,679
a thousand people were detained

834
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,799
which is horrible in and of itself

835
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,720
but simultaneously banks media outlets

836
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,080
and the government was hit by a denial

837
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,600
of service attack

838
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,240
it actually was so effective that cash

839
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,919
machines

840
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,960
were um unusable online banking was

841
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,720
completely out of service

842
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,559
government employees were unable to

843
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,399
communicate through email

844
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,519
and the newspapers and broadcasters were

845
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,440
unable to deliver the news

846
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,080
so the only news coming in was through

847
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,120
these

848
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,159
fake russian news reports

849
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,919
this is a great example of how you can

850
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,600
really combine

851
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,240
an infrastructure attack with a

852
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,600
disinformation campaign

853
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,360
in order to ultimately cause a lot more

854
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,399
confusion and chaos and damage

855
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,080
but what's also really important about

856
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,919
this is you're able to do this in such a

857
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,919
way

858
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,559
where you stay below the level of an

859
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,679
armed attack

860
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,880
and you can't necessarily um

861
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,679
say who or like attribute them to one

862
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:00,080
person

863
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,399
it's very attribution is so difficult

864
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,240
with cyber attacks

865
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,720
so even though you may suspect one group

866
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,679
you can't say

867
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,640
this is an act of war because again most

868
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,200
of it

869
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,840
to your knowledge is your people

870
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,720
excuse me

871
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,679
so let's talk about some potential

872
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:24,960
attacks that could happen on the

873
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,799
electorate

874
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,120
in 2003 a four-day power outage left at

875
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,720
least 100 people in the united states

876
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,279
and canada

877
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,000
dead imagine a scenario

878
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,919
where a power outage was caused by a

879
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,519
cyber attack

880
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,440
this is the type of thing that as we've

881
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,640
seen

882
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,679
could kill people but in addition

883
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,559
if that happens on election day you're

884
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,240
much less likely going to go to vote

885
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,600
because you have other things to worry

886
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,799
about like if what's

887
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,760
in your fridge is going bad or if your

888
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,720
parents are okay

889
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,360
if your siblings are okay a lot of

890
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,559
people

891
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,039
have a lot of things to worry about when

892
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,840
an entire city's power goes out

893
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,799
and voting automatically becomes less of

894
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,399
a priority because of something like

895
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,519
this happening

896
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,279
and it can cause a lot of division as

897
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,799
well because if it happens in certain

898
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,120
districts or certain areas

899
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,120
it can seem like intentional sabotage

900
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,799
the second is transit now

901
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,519
in 2016 san francisco's transit system

902
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,440
was infected with ransomware

903
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,279
i want you to imagine a day

904
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,559
an election day where we are thankfully

905
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,600
out of this lockdown um

906
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,480
back going into the office you take the

907
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,039
train

908
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,519
into work you say that you're gonna vote

909
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,960
after work

910
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,399
you um go into the office and you have a

911
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,120
normal work day maybe you go on twitter

912
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,880
during lunch you scroll past some

913
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,919
disinformation

914
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,080
hopefully you don't share it and then

915
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,440
you make it to the end of the day

916
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,440
and you go to get back on the train to

917
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,640
go vote and the train is shut down

918
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,880
it's not working what are you going to

919
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,840
be thinking about

920
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,199
in that moment are you going to be

921
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,280
thinking about how

922
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,800
you get to the polling place are you

923
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,159
going to be thinking about how annoyed

924
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,918
you are and how much you want to just go

925
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:16,639
home

926
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,000
and relax and how you have to pay for

927
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,800
that uber instead of just taking uh

928
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,000
taking the train

929
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,040
which you already have a pass for these

930
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,639
are the types of situations that can

931
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,839
cause people

932
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,359
to either just choose not to vote

933
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,440
or not have the time to vote or the

934
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,720
ability to go vote

935
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,520
and we can see that these types of

936
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,199
attacks are really across

937
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,320
all layers both in the infrastructure

938
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,480
information and ethos planes but also

939
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,760
all layers of the pyramid and

940
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,280
when you're thinking about this like

941
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,879
these are just a few

942
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,520
examples but think about all the other

943
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,680
possibilities in your daily life

944
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,880
that this could affect and i want to

945
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,040
dive back into the defender perspective

946
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
now that we have this point of view

947
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,280
on what different attacks could actually

948
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,340
be perpetrated

949
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,240
[Music]

950
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,920
so where does the current system leave

951
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,800
us

952
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,640
right now we have this very limited

953
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,720
definition of election security

954
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,280
we're talking about again databases i.t

955
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,079
infrastructure

956
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,960
the actual polling place itself and

957
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,720
here's what we've got

958
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,240
we have quotes like these where

959
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,920
top government officials are saying we

960
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,000
cannot exclude such activities

961
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,760
for example in germany we have

962
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,440
quotes from presidents tweets from

963
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,359
presidents saying that

964
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,119
the election is a scam we have quotes

965
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:47,520
from

966
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,839
congressional democrats saying that

967
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,599
they're deeply concerned about

968
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,760
disinformation that's going to be used

969
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,079
to

970
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,520
influence the presidential election

971
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,839
and while these are not necessarily

972
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,839
bad quotes because at least they're

973
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,839
referencing what's going on

974
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:10,160
they don't offer a solution there is no

975
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,839
okay here's the situation and here's

976
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,200
what you as an individual should be

977
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,480
doing right now

978
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,599
this is just a statement of fact

979
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,480
and that is where we are at right now is

980
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,119
there's no comprehensive solution

981
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,800
that's thinking about this

982
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,320
so where should we really be going where

983
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,560
do what do we need to be thinking about

984
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,240
in order to actually make our elections

985
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,000
more secure in order to

986
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
make sure that these type of attacks

987
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,760
aren't as impactful as they are right

988
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
now

989
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,720
and the answer is really we need a

990
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,560
broader definition of what election

991
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,400
security really is

992
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,359
it needs to take into account the things

993
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:47,839
that

994
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,040
really affect voters both willingness

995
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,400
and ability to turn out as well as their

996
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,160
faith in their country because that is

997
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,280
so critical

998
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,680
to making sure that people vote and i've

999
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,440
included a few examples based on what

1000
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,280
we've talked about today but there are

1001
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,320
others as well

1002
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,480
that are not being taken into account

1003
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,920
here and i'm sure that you guys can

1004
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,200
think of some

1005
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,160
when you think about what your typical

1006
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,480
day of voting looks like and i want to

1007
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,720
want you to think about that so that you

1008
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,839
can think about

1009
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,000
how you can defend it better like what

1010
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,240
do you do on election day do you

1011
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,320
vote before work i know that right now

1012
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,320
for example a lot of people are using

1013
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,359
mail and ballots

1014
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,480
which i'm a big proponent of even though

1015
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,320
it's taking so long in some states

1016
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,040
and that's exhausting um but what's

1017
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,960
important is

1018
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,040
think about what you do in a normal day

1019
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,480
think about if you're fact checking

1020
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,160
everything that you're posting

1021
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,440
think about um how modern events

1022
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,839
can change how you choose to vote one of

1023
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,040
the pluses

1024
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,320
of early voting and of mail-in ballots

1025
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,640
is

1026
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,359
a lot of these time-based attacks that

1027
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,240
are really limited to that election day

1028
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,480
are now not as effective because we have

1029
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,560
so many people who are able to vote

1030
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,880
before the actual election day but of

1031
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,119
course things like early voting and

1032
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,200
mail-in ballots they have everything has

1033
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,560
its own threat model

1034
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,079
we just have to figure out what is going

1035
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,680
to be what is going to reduce

1036
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,720
risk effectively

1037
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,119
so when you think about what your

1038
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,079
election day

1039
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,480
looks like or looked like this year

1040
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,400
think about it in the context of an

1041
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,680
attack

1042
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,640
how would you attack each level of this

1043
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,680
pyramid

1044
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,440
how does each level of this pyramid

1045
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,040
really affect your

1046
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,320
willingness to go vote

1047
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,520
and use that information to think about

1048
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,119
what change we need to drive

1049
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,440
both at the government level but also as

1050
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,320
individuals

1051
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,240
as organizations think about how

1052
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,320
we need to change our current systems

1053
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,000
how we need to adapt

1054
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,280
to face this threat

1055
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,160
and ultimately how do we actually defend

1056
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,200
each one of these

1057
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,920
because as i mentioned earlier it is not

1058
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,599
the government's job

1059
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,079
to make sure that no disinformation is

1060
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,000
being posted on social media sites

1061
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,440
or to make sure that um the electric

1062
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,720
grid isn't hit by

1063
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,280
a cyber attack necessarily because some

1064
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,280
are privately held

1065
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,880
but what is important

1066
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,800
is building partnerships with these

1067
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,040
groups considering how this could

1068
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,680
impact the election and communicating

1069
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,160
that to these companies

1070
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,680
so when we think about what we can

1071
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,000
really do to protect democracy

1072
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,560
i want us to think about things like

1073
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,359
first off

1074
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,160
securing your systems as an individual

1075
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,400
and

1076
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,960
at work whether you work for the

1077
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,400
government or not

1078
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,880
because ultimately if you are a part of

1079
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,560
an organization that's a critical

1080
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,240
infrastructure provider

1081
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,680
you are most likely a very good target

1082
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,359
when someone is trying to affect the

1083
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,040
outcome of an election or

1084
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,359
to cause a breakdown within a government

1085
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,280
this and as an individual of course you

1086
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,480
are as well

1087
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,040
the second thing i recommend is to work

1088
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,400
with the government

1089
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,240
there are a lot of great organizations

1090
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,920
out there that allow you to work with

1091
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,680
the government one is infragard i'm a

1092
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,040
member of infraguard i'm a huge

1093
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,720
supporter of that group

1094
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,720
um find ways to partner with the

1095
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,319
government so that you can go to them

1096
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,160
and say hey i'm worried about election

1097
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,880
day

1098
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,760
i think that my company could have an

1099
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,079
issue on election day because of xyz

1100
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,640
and i want to open a communications

1101
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,599
channel with you

1102
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,920
so that if something happens we can have

1103
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,480
a process in place to address it

1104
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,160
and then the last is to fight

1105
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,040
disinformation as much as possible and

1106
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,400
this can be many forms

1107
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,680
ultimately it's about being a trusted

1108
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,800
and kind resource to those around you

1109
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,000
especially when they're

1110
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,480
sharing this information if one of your

1111
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,920
friends or family members

1112
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,240
is spreading this information the best

1113
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,160
thing that you can do

1114
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,200
is try to understand their point of view

1115
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,359
and then be there to communicate the

1116
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,200
reality of the situation

1117
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,720
because there's a reason that they're

1118
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,319
communicating and sharing

1119
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,680
what they're communicating and it's

1120
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,000
because it's deeply tied

1121
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,800
to their emotional state and it agrees

1122
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,200
with what they feel emotionally

1123
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,960
and you're not going to get anywhere by

1124
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,319
trying to shame someone

1125
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,280
out of believing in disinformation the

1126
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,200
best thing that you can do

1127
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,400
is be there and just it's constant work

1128
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,800
it's constant effort of trying to

1129
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,240
make sure that they understand the

1130
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,920
reality of the situation

1131
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,599
in a way that they feel safe

1132
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,960
so i have written a white paper on this

1133
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,599
and it

1134
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,160
is totally free to download whatever you

1135
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:46,800
like

1136
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,920
um just go to that url

1137
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,440
and it's all about everything that we

1138
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,280
discussed here today so just some more

1139
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,440
reading for you if you're interested

1140
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,520
and i want to thank you guys so much for

1141

if you have any questions at all i'm

1143
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,280

1144
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,839
um you can also find me on twitter at

1145
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,480
hacker bella

1146
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,079
thanks thanks a lot aly that was a uh

1147
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,680
interesting talk i do have a question

1148
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,520
um i mean you and i both bank

1149
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,560
online every day and we trust the bank

1150
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,800
to handle our banking transactions over

1151
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,839
the internet do you

1152
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,480
ever see a point to where we'll be

1153
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,200
voting like that

1154
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,280
um i do i think it's very immature

1155
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,119
and it is many many years away

1156
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,240
like probably i hope it's

1157
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,280
15 to 20 minimum um

1158
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,200
it's it would be very

1159
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,839
beneficial in order to get people access

1160
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:50,880
to vote more

1161
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,280
but things like what happened in iowa

1162
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,520
which

1163
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,680
wasn't even affected by a cyber attack

1164
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,839
are very scary and i think

1165
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,440
the way that i like to talk about this

1166
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,599
is there's a culture clash

1167
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,040
between the tech space and the

1168
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,119
um the government space so basically

1169
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,000
when you think about it tech they have

1170
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,280
to move fast

1171
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,960
they have to build features and they

1172
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,400
have to get features out because they

1173
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,040
have to win

1174
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,440
against the competition government is

1175
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,400
very different

1176
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,400
government is about especially when it

1177
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,440
comes to elections

1178
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,240
they have to build a robust system

1179
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,000
that's going to maintain the

1180
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,760
integrity of the count that's going to

1181
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,079
keep the ballots confidential

1182
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,359
and it's going to be very reliable and

1183
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:41,119
so when we try to use new technology or

1184
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,040
even sometimes old technology

1185
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,280
within a government setting there's just

1186
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,440
a huge culture clash between the two

1187
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,200
and until we get that figured out until

1188
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,800
we can really make

1189
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,960
the tech more robust we're just not

1190
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,240
going to be able to use it in that way

1191
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,880
there was a pilot program here in west

1192
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,599
virginia

1193
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,960
that was specifically geared to

1194
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,040
a very small population of people and

1195
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,079
that was

1196
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,800
active duty military members that that

1197
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,440
are from

1198
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,440
residents in west virginia then and what

1199
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,520
the secretary of state here did

1200
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,680
was they pushed out an app to those

1201
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,760
people to allow them to vote

1202
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,560
uh through the app now of course you

1203
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,960
know that's a very small

1204
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,640
group of people you know less than a

1205
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,400
thousand so you know there was no way

1206
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:26,800
that

1207
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,480
spongebob squarepants was going to get

1208
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,480
elected governor because

1209
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,480
you know nobody was going to be able to

1210
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,520
spoof you know

1211
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,200
thou tens of thousands of votes because

1212
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,200
they knew that they were only going to

1213
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:37,520
be

1214
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,760
this x number but that but that test was

1215
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,680
very successful here

1216
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,839
that's awesome i'm glad to hear that i

1217
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,839
think that those types of small tests

1218
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,839
are the best way to start moving towards

1219
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:48,240
that

1220
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,440
you know and really like to experiment

1221
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,720
with portions of the population the

1222
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,079
thing that scares me is when they're

1223
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,359
like we're just going to roll this out

1224
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:55,760
for

1225
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,720
an entire state or for an entire country

1226
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,359
and

1227
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,280
there just hasn't been the testing that

1228
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,200
we really need in order to make sure

1229
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,839
that that's safe

1230
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,520
let me check discord here to see if

1231
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,280
there's anybody has any questions no i

1232
