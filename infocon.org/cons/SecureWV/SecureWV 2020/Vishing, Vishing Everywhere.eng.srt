1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,599
all right everyone yeah we're going to

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,120
talk about wishing be

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,160
with it all the stinking time um

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,160
it's it's fascinating to me because a

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,440
lot of the wishing stuff

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,440
is uh around psychology and we're going

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,360
to get into the psychology of this

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,880
it's very similar to the psychology of

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,920
fishing um but fishing is of course

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,800
the voice fishing side of things so um

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,160
it's one of these things that we get

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,119
just

13
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,760
just so often it blows my mind how often

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,400
we get these

15
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,320
uh kind of calls and the fact that we

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,920
don't even

17
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,840
regulate that or stop it in any way it

18
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,680
seems in the us here

19
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,280
and things like spoofing numbers is

20
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,960
perfectly legal

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,040
and we'll talk about that too but it's a

22
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,399
very interesting topic

23
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,920
so hopefully you'll learn a few things

24
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,600
from hit from here

25
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,120
that maybe you haven't seen in other

26
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,200
places okay i'm not going to get into a

27
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,079
super deep like

28
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,600
technical dive but we are going to talk

29
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,280
about the psychology behind it

30
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,879
and how this kind of rolls around and

31
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,640
comes to play with it

32
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,079
so starting out my name eric crone i am

33
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,160
a security awareness advocate yes that

34
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
is a real title

35
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,119
folks um basically what it means is uh

36
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,520
you know i work for no before and what

37
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,880
we do is we do

38
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,119
uh we do training we do end user

39
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,040
training and simulated fishing

40
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,119
we also have a wishing portion to our

41
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,360
platform which is kind of nice

42
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,960
but you know in working for

43
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,360
know before i get to take the experience

44
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,960
i've had throughout my career

45
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,200
and share stuff with y'all i don't do

46
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,720
sales i don't do any of that stuff i

47
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,520
just get to share

48
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,680
experience that's what an advocate does

49
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,880
and so

50
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,439
my background i got started in security

51
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,479
and i t back in like 1995 i think

52
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,200
is when i first got into it i've worked

53
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,079
in healthcare i've worked in

54
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,560
manufacturing

55
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,320
i've worked in lots of different

56
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,680
industries

57
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,399
around the world and i spent 10 years

58
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,799
with the us army as a contractor

59
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,799
at the second regional cyber center

60
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,719
western hemisphere which is super

61
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,000
impressive to say until you have to

62
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,280
answer the phone a lot

63
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,960
but uh there i ended up the security

64
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,600
manager uh of that organization

65
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,520
so um quite a bit of background there

66
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,799
done a lot of things and

67
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,959
and to me one of the things i've noticed

68
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,080
throughout my career is

69
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,239
people are targets and people are far

70
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,599
too often

71
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,040
the area where things go wrong and

72
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,040
you know so my passion is really on that

73
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,040
side of things also if any of you

74
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,360
on here right now are cissps and have

75
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,560
been for a little while

76
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,319
um i was the director of member

77
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,400
relations and services for isc squared

78
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:28,800
for

79
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,120
for a couple of years so um if you

80
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,120
remember when the cpe requirements went

81
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,319
up uh my name

82
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,680
was on the bottom of that uh that note

83
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,599
just remember i was the messenger for

84
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,239
the board it wasn't me making the change

85
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,080
anyway so you know i've been through a

86
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,680
lot of things seen a lot of stuff in my

87
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,800
time

88
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,720
and that's where the fishing thing and

89
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,319
fishing and all of the issuings

90
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,599
are very interesting to me so again i

91
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,120
work for no before i'm down in tampa

92
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,640
florida right now where it's actually

93
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,239
quite nice for a change

94
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,840
although we're looking at a week in the

95
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,120
uh high 80s i think going ahead so

96
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,280
feel nice if you have nice weather out

97
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,800
where you're at

98
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,519
so let's start with this um let's start

99
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,560
with

100
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,480
these kind of attacks let's talk stock

101
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,720
start with basically cyber security in

102
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,920
general right

103
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,159
um and we go back to sun tzu he wrote

104
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,040
this little book

105
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,159
fairly recent um the art of war you

106
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,040
might have heard of it

107
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
uh you may have seen a slide like this

108
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,959
in just about every cyber security

109
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,239
conference you ever go to but that's

110
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,120
because

111
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,200
it is actually still very relevant and

112
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,239
it's kind of cool that

113
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,720
all these years later the same sorts of

114
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,480
things still play out and that says a

115
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,000
lot about our human nature and who we

116
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,400
are

117
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,319
but this quote all warfare is based on

118
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,760
deception

119
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,560
that really drives true here in in all

120
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,480
of this human targeting toward us sort

121
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,159
of stuff and the social engineering sort

122
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,120
of stuff

123
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,720
and you know i've had people say well

124
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,360
warfare is kind of a strong word

125
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,400
but the deal is um we are really

126
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,280
in a state of warfare so when we talk

127
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,640
about the kind of attacks that are

128
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,159
happening out there these days

129
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,239
they're oftentimes run by large gangs

130
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,840
especially in the ransomware side of the

131
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,439
business email compromise

132
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,360
we're seeing nation states involved i

133
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,439
mean just what a week or so ago we

134
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,560
charged

135
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,360
six people from the gru the russian side

136
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,680
with

137
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,560
uh espionage and cyber crime you know

138
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,320
back in 2014

139
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,800
uh i think is when we first charged the

140
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,680
chinese

141
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,440
uh there were like five or six chinese

142
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,520
that we charged so there's big players

143
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,639
in this game

144
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,680
and that's something that a lot of

145
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,759
people underestimate

146
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,800
is how serious these folks are and how

147
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,720
talented they are and the resources they

148
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,080
have available

149
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,479
um so it is warfare it's happening all

150
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,280
the time

151
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,040
with wishing i mean if you have a cell

152
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,440
phone you've pretty much received

153
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,440
some of these calls or attempted calls

154
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,840
or text messages the smishing side

155
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,960
it's happened it just does because this

156
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,440
is just crazy times for that so

157
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,479
uh we're going to talk a little bit

158
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,400
about how this deception comes into play

159
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,160
and the key things about this

160
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,759
um these are the fourth or the three

161
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,720
things we're going to talk about the

162
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,520
psychology behind vishing

163
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,039
some of the wishing attacks and how we

164
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,039
can defend ourselves

165
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,520
the psychology to me is very important

166
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,919
and i say this because

167
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,280
if we understand how the attacks work

168
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,360
it doesn't matter kind of the the

169
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,880
the game that they play around at the

170
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,800
pretext they use okay

171
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,960
if we understand how the attack works

172
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,360
and we can see the mechanics of it

173
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,680
then we can defend ourselves against it

174
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,360
uh i was at a

175
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,520
conference a couple years ago now and

176
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,280
they had this magician now this is cyber

177
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,479
security conference

178
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,639
and they had this magician going around

179
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,479
and he would like take people's watch

180
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,840
off and do stuff like this when they

181
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,120
weren't even see it was all slight of

182
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,160
hand stuff

183
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,000
and what he did to me he had this little

184
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,360
foam rubber ball

185
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,880
and he came up and he did a couple

186
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,479
things and then he had my you know put

187
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,560
my arms against my chest and then when i

188
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,639
opened my arms up in the left uh in my

189
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,919
left elbow and the crook of my left

190
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,280
elbow was that foam rubber ball and i

191
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,880
never felt him put it there and i said

192
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,840
okay

193
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,600
now that you've done this let's do it

194
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,039
again and uh

195
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,039
sure enough at that point because i knew

196
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,800
it was coming and i knew how the the

197
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,160
thing was gonna work or at least how the

198
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,199
end state was

199
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,199
i could tell when he bumped my right

200
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,120
shoulder to distract me that's a focus

201
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,800
redirection sort of technique

202
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,720
and then slipped it in then i could tell

203
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,000
so once i understood

204
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,800
how it was wherever he tried to put it i

205
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,880
could tell the things that were going on

206
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,280
it's the same way with scams and that's

207
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,440
what we try to tell people

208
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,560
understand the mechanics don't focus so

209
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
much on just

210
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,720
the specifics for a certain one and then

211
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,880
you'll be able to spot the other ones

212
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,800
now the way that this all works the

213
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,560
psychology here the first thing we have

214
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,240
to understand is that

215
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,319
our brain is actually the root of the

216
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,680
deception right

217
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,000
and our brain's job is to filter

218
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,639
interpret and present reality

219
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,680
and we oftentimes think reality is

220
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,520
you know what we smell what we taste

221
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,960
what we hear

222
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,639
what we smell all of those are real but

223
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,160
what we don't understand is that our

224
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,120
brain actually filters a lot of things

225
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,520
as they get to us now i can do whole

226
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,840
sessions on this i've done whole like

227
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,759
talks on this so we can get really deep

228
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,960
into this kind of stuff

229
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,120
it's fascinating to me if you if you're

230
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,560
interested at all

231
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,319
there's a series out there called brain

232
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,759
games and i want to say it's on hulu now

233
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,160
but it's a fantastic series that

234
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,000
basically explores all of these

235
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,599
different things that our brains do that

236
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,599
we don't even realize they're doing

237
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,160
okay if you've ever seen the dancing

238
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,280
monkey

239
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,039
video where all this stuff is going on

240
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,560
there's actually a dancing monkey in the

241
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,240
background nobody ever sees the monkey

242
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,440
right because there's this other stuff

243
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,319
going on

244
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,479
it's amazing this kind of stuff and you

245
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,759
can see it there but this is what our

246
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,400
brain does

247
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,319
it interprets and presents reality to us

248
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,000
and these filters are things that are

249
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,599
that are built by our

250
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,479
our you know by ourselves throughout our

251
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,560
lifetimes it's through the experiences

252
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,240
that we've had it's the

253
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,599
the things that we've done where we've

254
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,360
seen something happen and then something

255
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,720
else happens we've seen it happen a

256
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,840
couple times now

257
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,400
we always expect that when a happens b

258
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,840
happens afterwards

259
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,759
so we get in that kind of pattern and

260
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,680
things and so you can take advantage of

261
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,479
these

262
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,840
uh and it's really uh it's fascinating

263
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,039
like i said now the first thing i'm

264
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,560
going to show you here

265
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,319
when we're talking about filters let's

266
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,000
look at some examples here

267
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,479
first of all what is reality right who

268
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,000
remembers the dress

269
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,720
okay so is it blue and black is it gold

270
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,039
and white well

271
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,958
this was one of those things where you

272
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,880
know it fascinated millions of people

273
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,559
you have two people sitting there at the

274
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,080
same monitor in the same lighting

275
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,519
conditions and everything

276
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,839
and you're looking at this dress and two

277
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,440
people see it in a different

278
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,240
color now this was my wife and i

279
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,760
actually we saw things in different

280
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,640
colors here

281
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,240
i saw the blue and black she saw the

282
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,720
white and gold because she's not here

283
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,160
right now i'd like to point out that i

284
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,360
was right

285
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,680
but don't go telling her that but this

286
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,440
was our brain filtering these things and

287
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,600
even once we saw a picture like this

288
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,959
where you can see them in both ways

289
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,320
if you go back and you look at the

290
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,000
original picture

291
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,600
you're going to see probably what you

292
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,839
originally saw it's very hard to see the

293
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,440
other one with that because our brain

294
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,800
just filters it that's what it thinks it

295
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,560
sees and that's the reality it presents

296
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,600
one way or another

297
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,519
the other thing was that audio file with

298
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,800
yani or laurel

299
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,519
if you remember that one both sounds

300
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,880
were actually in there

301
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,160
and there are some things there that

302
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,839
have to do with our hearing and

303
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,360
different things like that but

304
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,519
when they separate it out you could hear

305
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,120
both of them separately but then put

306
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,399
them back together you're only getting

307
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,839
here one or the other

308
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,680
and the reason for that is once our

309
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,600
brain gets that sound

310
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,000
it filters out the other side of things

311
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,440
it does it automatically it's

312
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,600
really hard for us to step in and try to

313
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,480
actually

314
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,600
bypass and go a different way and last

315
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,959
but not least

316
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,680
there's the auto stereograms and uh

317
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,560
these

318
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,920
i'm showing my age here these were real

319
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,160
popular back in like the 80s 90s sort of

320
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,800
thing

321
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,519
i i am that old these are called audio

322
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,000
stereograms or auto stereograms

323
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
and they create the illusion of three

324
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,920
dimensions now in that mess of

325
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,680
stuff that you see there allegedly

326
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,279
there's a shark in there

327
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,600
now i was never real good at these uh i

328
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,959
know people that were much better than

329
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:19,760
me

330
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,279
every once in a while i could pick one

331
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,800
of these out but this one

332
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,399
i still haven't seen a shark and i've

333
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,480
stared at this thing way longer

334
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,880
than i probably should but allegedly

335
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,000
there's a shark in there and i've been

336
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,360
told there is

337
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,720
but what happens is you got to cross

338
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,000
your eyes a little bit or whatever and

339
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,440
then this 3d image kind of like pops out

340
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,519
and once you see that image if you come

341
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,720
back to this thing

342
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,120
in an hour or two it's going to take you

343
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,880
far less time to be able to see that

344
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,320
image again because your brain

345
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,800
already knows it exists it already knows

346
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,240
how it's there it already knows how to

347
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,079
deal with these other patterns

348
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,640
and it will it will filter that out much

349
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,360
much quicker than it does the first time

350
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,279
you try to see this this is another

351
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,560
example of your brain

352
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,760
and last but not least if you take your

353
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,320
eyes

354
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,079
you look down look left look right with

355
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,240
your eyes you probably didn't see your

356
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,800
nose

357
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,480
well your nose is there all the time if

358
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,760
you're thinking about it you can see

359
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,040
your nose and your vision

360
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,120
but your brain actually cuts that part

361
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,640
out and it's the same for people like me

362
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,920
that wear glasses

363
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,560
i don't see the frame of my glasses

364
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,399
because my brain filters that out if i

365
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,000
start thinking about it then i can see

366
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,480
it

367
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,320
but otherwise we just don't see it so

368
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,680
you'll see a pattern here

369
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,600
the things that we think are reality are

370
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,839
not always reality and that's one of our

371
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:32,240
our

372
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,120
problems that we have it's a trait it's

373
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,079
it's just

374
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,040
something that is so these are the types

375
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,440
of things that people take advantage of

376
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,800
now i'm going to do something here next

377
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,560
that's a lot of fun

378
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,839
i don't know if you've ever seen this

379
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,600
done before but we're going to do a card

380
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,040
trick in powerpoint

381
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,440
okay so let's get ready let's pop into

382
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,480
this first of all

383
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,839
i want you to pick a card i want you to

384
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,200
pick any card make sure you know which

385
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,480
card that is that you're going to pick

386
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,680
and now through the magic

387
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,000
of powerpoint i'm going to make your

388
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,440
card disappear

389
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,880
and this is this is a magic transition

390
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,480
that's really what it is

391
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,440
so is your card gone now everyone should

392
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,320
be nodding

393
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,880
right everyone should be nodding and so

394
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,200
how did i do that how did i remove your

395
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,880
card figure out what card you had

396
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,760
and remove your card you know over the

397
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,600
the power of the interwebs

398
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,680
well first of all we start with this

399
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,959
grouping of cards

400
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,800
and second of all we end with this

401
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,000
grouping of cards

402
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,279
now that you have them here in front of

403
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,440
you what do you see well

404
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,120
if you picked it up these are two

405
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,600
completely different groups of cards

406
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,360
now in the second group had i put in

407
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,120
like 2 through 10 you would have seen

408
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,560
very easily

409
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,800
that it wasn't the same but by keeping

410
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,560
with the patterns the color patterns

411
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,279
there

412
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,120
the fact that i had you focus on the

413
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,040
card that i'm going to remove

414
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,560
makes you not pay attention to the

415
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,480
surrounding cards and then when we

416
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,120
replace

417
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,079
those other ones with similar patterns

418
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,680
you didn't really notice the difference

419
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,120
and the reason again there is

420
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,000
i've got your focus pointed to one thing

421
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,160
that's a focus redirection thing

422
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,920
and these are things that once you get

423
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,440
that focus on something

424
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,120
lots of other things can happen around

425
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,720
you that should be signs that

426
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,160
something's wrong

427
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,800
but they aren't you don't see it you

428
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,440
don't

429
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,920
notice these things and these are all

430
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,519
things that are applied in social

431
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,040
engineering

432
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
and social engineering is the key behind

433
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,200
wishing now again i told you this was a

434
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,399
very strong on the psychological portion

435
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,200
because uh

436
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,279
if you understand how all this works it

437
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,519
makes sense then when you look at these

438
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,000
and you can kind of tear them apart now

439
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,200
i love this quote

440
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,240
this is elliott alderson from mr robot

441
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,839
i've never found it hard to hack most

442
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,760
people if you watch them listen to them

443
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,440
or if you listen to them watch them

444
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,040
their vulnerabilities like a neon sign

445
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,320
screwed into their heads

446
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,959
this is absolutely true and you can see

447
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,800
this with people when you're interacting

448
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,000
with them

449
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,079
think about group settings where you've

450
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,000
met people that you don't know perhaps

451
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,959
imagine imagine a day when there's a

452
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,519
security conferences that are in person

453
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,760
okay imagine this and you're talking to

454
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,720
other people

455
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,040
you can generally pick out what that

456
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,639
person's

457
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,519
traits are fairly quickly like you can

458
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,360
tell the introverts from the extroverts

459
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,079
pretty quickly

460
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,639
usually the people that are a little bit

461
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,560
quieter versus those are a little bit

462
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,160
more rowdy

463
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,040
these are all things that we see some of

464
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,600
the

465
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,199
things that we use in social engineering

466
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,720
you look at somebody and you say hey is

467
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,040
this person subject to

468
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,120
say aggression so if i get aggressive

469
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,639
with this person are they going to back

470
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,199
down

471
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,279
or are they going to push back right and

472
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,360
both of those are actually

473
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,800
vulnerabilities it's just a matter of

474
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,240
which one you're going to take advantage

475
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,880
of so

476
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,800
understand that it's not hard to do this

477
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,320
with people it's something that we can

478
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,240
spot very easily

479
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,720
so social engineering takes advantage of

480
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,399
our vulnerabilities the other thing it

481
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,000
takes advantage of

482
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,959
is this there's basically these two

483
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,399
systems of thinking

484
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,959
now system one is our fast thinking this

485
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:01,680
is our

486
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,800
the stuff we use like 95 of the time our

487
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,920
lives are run

488
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,360
in system one thinking um this is where

489
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,880
uh somebody kicks a soccer ball and it

490
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,040
comes at you you you duck or you grab it

491
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,639
you know you catch it or

492
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,240
something along those lines we didn't

493
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,079
think about it we didn't consciously

494
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,279
think about it we don't think about

495
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,880
breathing we don't think about any of

496
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,519
that

497
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,519
it just automatically happens that's

498
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,880
system one thing

499
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,000
system two thing uh thinking is

500
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,880
more along the lines of problem solving

501
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,639
so this is where we have to do math

502
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,440
problems

503
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,399
that's system two okay uh where we have

504
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:36,800
to

505
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,120
figure out how things work we have to do

506
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,160
all this you know

507
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,519
anytime we we go into figuring things

508
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,120
out or critical thinking

509
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,399
that's a system two side of things well

510
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,160
system one is fantastic it gets us

511
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,320
through most things and this is where we

512
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,800
build

513
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,399
these filters come into play where if

514
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,920
something happens we expect something

515
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,600
else to happen afterwards right

516
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,839
so somebody kicks a soccer ball at you

517
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,120
you might have been hit in the head with

518
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,720
a soccer ball before so you know you're

519
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,680
going to get head in the head with

520
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,040
soccer ball so you catch it or you

521
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,320
deflect it or whatever

522
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,240
this all happens very quick the problem

523
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,079
with system one thinking is

524
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,399
it's very error prone because it relies

525
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,759
on that sort of thing

526
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,240
where system two is where we actually do

527
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,079
our critical thinking pieces

528
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,880
okay now when it comes to these sort of

529
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,839
social engineering

530
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,000
attacks what these folks want to do is

531
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,360
they want to push you into the system

532
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,759
one thinking because it is error prone

533
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,519
because this is where we get you

534
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,920
focusing on a certain single thing

535
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,600
and you don't notice the other stuff

536
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,079
going on um

537
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,160
most of the time the way they do this is

538
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,560
through emotions

539
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,279
emotions drive us into responsive system

540
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,079
one thinking

541
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,440
extremely fast especially emotions of

542
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,839
fear

543
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,000
um concern things like that that drives

544
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,839
us into the system one thinking

545
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,759
really really quick um and so it's

546
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,279
important to understand kind of how

547
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,480
these things work

548
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,759
we're going to talk a little bit more

549
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,320
about you know how these play into

550
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,240
phishing attacks so i hope you

551
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,359
understand a little bit more the

552
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,599
psychology behind these and honestly why

553
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,119
they're so effective because

554
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,799
we are human and they take advantage of

555
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,640
these things so we're going to talk now

556
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,720
about some of the fishing attacks

557
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,839
uh the first thing you need to

558
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,359
understand is in social engineering

559
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,079
there's the the

560
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,640
major social engineering attack vectors

561
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,000
the uh the isshings

562
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
if you will uh fishing fishing and

563
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
smishing so phishing is you know we get

564
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
the emails all the time with that

565
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,880
uh vishing is the voice fishing okay so

566
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,240
like the irs

567
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,160
calls and we'll get into that and then

568
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,240
smishing is the text message one

569
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,880
as well uh so that's where you get the

570
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,360
text messages on your phone um sometimes

571
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,120
we see hybrids of these

572
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,200
um a lot of times it's a combination of

573
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,720
like phishing and smishing we'll see a

574
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,600
hybrid

575
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,200
where you'll get a phishing email and

576
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,880
this is for the really targeted stuff

577
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,280
but

578
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,880
you get a phishing email followed by a

579
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,559
text message saying hey i sent you a

580
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,360
message

581
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,840
can you check it out that's a hybrid

582
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,880
attack very

583
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,039
focused type of attack but these things

584
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,240
can be combined

585
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,440
in different ways okay vishing is a

586
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,880
little bit tougher to do those with

587
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,559
because you would recognize the person

588
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,360
on the other

589
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,559
end of the phone's uh voice okay and so

590
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,000
that can be a real problem there

591
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,600
uh that's why we don't see it as much

592
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,360
now i expect though

593
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,600
as deep fake technology gets better on

594
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,200
the voice side we're gonna start seeing

595
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,320
some real-time

596
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,440
um vishing hybrids like this where the

597
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,080
person

598
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,240
is going to sound like a ceo and say hey

599
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,600
did you check this out

600
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
so expect to see these things being used

601
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,039
a little bit more in the very near

602
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,280
future as hybrid attacks as well

603
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,039
so these are the major attack vectors

604
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,480
obviously we're talking about vishing a

605
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,760
lot today

606
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,840
well envisioning one of the key things

607
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,000
to a successful wishing attack

608
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,200
is getting information about people and

609
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,640
so what do they use for that it's called

610
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,600
open source intelligence or osint

611
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,679
so this is basically you're going to go

612
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,200
in you're going to do some research on a

613
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,679
person

614
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,320
because you know we have our our blanket

615
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
wishing stuff but then we have the stuff

616
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,679
that's a little bit more focused

617
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,799
okay um according to wikipedia

618
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,520
you know they're saying here it's public

619
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,080
data

620
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,600
all right this is what it boils down to

621
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,679
is open source intelligence is public

622
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:12,240
data

623
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,919
it's not stuff you go buy in the dark

624
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,080
web it's not stuff like that

625
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,559
um it's stuff that we put out there as

626
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,799
part of our digital footprint

627
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,160
um it's it's you know your social media

628
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,559
profile uh there's stuff in social media

629
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,640
there's stuff that you end up googled on

630
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,400
uh you know your name shows up in here

631
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,320
there or whatever there's all that stuff

632
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,400
that's open source intelligence now

633
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,120
oceans is not always bad and that's

634
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,559
important to understand just like social

635
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,200
engineering

636
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,880
isn't always bad i'll give you an

637
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,320
example of that

638
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,160
when we used to work in our office with

639
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,480
our older security system getting

640
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,799
in like our door system we used

641
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,760
fingerprints

642
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,640
and because i do a lot of woodwork i do

643
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,240
a lot of hands-on stuff my fingerprints

644
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,520
are always getting messed up right i

645
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,840
always got cuts and stuff across them so

646
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,320
my fingers don't work great on those

647
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,039
systems

648
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,919
so our policy says if you know the

649
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:04,720
person

650
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,559
you can allow them to follow you in the

651
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,919
door if you don't know them then you

652
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,200
need to have them do their fingerprint

653
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,679
well

654
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,760
because i'm a public figure people

655
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,000
pretty much know me in the office right

656
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,760
so because i know that when i would go

657
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,039
to the door and i'd put my finger on

658
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,559
there i'd be standing there forever

659
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,080
because my fingerprint just didn't

660
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,960
work what would happen is i started

661
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,240
getting in the elevator

662
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,919
in the mornings and i would move to the

663
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,440
back of the elevator

664
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,039
that way when we came up to the floor

665
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,679
we're on someone else would go ahead of

666
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,240
me

667
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,080
they would scan their finger the door

668
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,679
would open we would go in

669
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,520
right they knew who i was so it was

670
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,360
perfectly good with policy

671
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,520
um but it it actually worked for our

672
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,520
benefit by not having me sitting there

673
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,039
with my fingerprint that doesn't work so

674
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,320
that's an example where

675
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,159
social engineering can be used in a good

676
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,840
way same thing with open source

677
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,200
intelligence

678
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,720
if we're taking a new job or we're

679
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,559
looking at moving to a new city

680
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,080
we're going to research that city we're

681
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,280
going to look at crime rates we're going

682
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,559
to look at this that and the other thing

683
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,480
when i moved to florida here my wife

684
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,320
had a spreadsheet laid out with every

685
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,159
school district she could find in the

686
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,720
in the tampa area roughly and you know

687
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,480
the school ratings and all this kind of

688
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,400
stuff that's open source intelligence

689
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,080
we're going to look at that stuff and so

690
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,159
again it's not always used for bad

691
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,760
we don't always equate it with that but

692
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,520
when we do research like that

693
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,559
we're gathering ocent the trick is um

694
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,640
the social engineers will do ocean on

695
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,559
you to find some vulnerabilities or

696
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,080
something that they can use

697
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,360
to build a pretext so they're going to

698
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,159
look at your

699
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,400
hobbies uh political affiliations you

700
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,919
may or may not have noticed there's some

701
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,520
political stuff going on in the last

702
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,640
year or so

703
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,400
um those are great things to get people

704
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,360
with so if you think about it political

705
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,799
affiliations right now

706
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,520
is has been a hot topic for a while here

707
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,039
and if you really want to get somebody

708
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,320
emotionally

709
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,919
um disturbed or or spun up

710
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,159
then you start talking politics with

711
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,120
people uh

712
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,159
and so if if somebody can figure out

713
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,159
what your political affiliation is

714
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,080
they can use that against you a lot of

715
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,320
times and we've seen some very targeted

716
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,720
attacks that do that sort of thing

717
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,159
and it doesn't matter what side you're

718
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,080
on either way and why is that because

719
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,000
it's such an emotional thing remember

720
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,760
we get emotionally spun up we fall into

721
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,440
the system one thinking

722
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,080
and it all goes downhill well they build

723
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,280
these pretexts

724
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,799
so they figure out some things about you

725
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,480
they figure out about your family they

726
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,520
figure out

727
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,400
about stuff like this right and then

728
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,559
they turn it into an attack

729
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,159
now the pretext is designed to make

730
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,240
people feel more legitimate they let

731
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,440
their guard down

732
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,919
because people think oh you know how do

733
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,080
these people know so much about me

734
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,640
uh well they must be legitimate because

735
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,559
they know what kind of car i drive

736
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,760
um and so therefore you know their their

737
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,880
car warranty must be

738
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,120
legitimate but it's not it's available

739
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,200
out there they can find that stuff

740
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,679
and in this in this attack scenario

741
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,360
we've seen some interesting things done

742
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,720
with pretex

743
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,200
a couple years ago there was a this

744
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,400
happened a few times i think it was

745
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,080
southern california

746
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,400
where the parents would get like an

747
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,120
email or a call and they would say

748
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,799
i've got little johnny and if you don't

749
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,559
send us some money

750
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,640
you won't ever see little johnny again

751
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,159
and so these people freak out they're

752
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,520
losing their minds right

753
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,200
and basically what happens is the these

754
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,840
folks are able to go out on social media

755
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,000
and figure out where their kids went to

756
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,760
school they could figure out what times

757
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,679
the school was working you know and

758
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,280
stuff like that

759
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,600
and they would know where these folks

760
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,880
are and of course when they told them

761
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,320
this it's like if you call the school

762
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,440
johnny's gone

763
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,600
call the police johnny's gone right and

764
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,120
so these people were believing it

765
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,480
well they found this all out because

766
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,159
it's public information little johnny's

767
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,520
over there fat dumb and happy eating

768
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,880
lunch at school

769
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,880
and you know nothing's going on this is

770
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,559
this is the kind of stuff that happens

771
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,320
with pretext

772
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,080
it's very easy to find that information

773
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,679
it's not always that targeted but it

774
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,440
certainly can be

775
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,159
now if you've ever been to one of the

776
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,240
conferences this was defcon

777
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,520
where they had the social engineer

778
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
village chris haddnaggy does an awesome

779
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,559
job with this

780
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,919
so basically they get the person up

781
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:06,799
there they put them in that little

782
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,559
soundproof booth you got a mic you can

783
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,520
hear things

784
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,120
on the outside you know as you're

785
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,799
listening in um

786
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,200
this is all about the key to this is

787
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,279
doing the ocean doing

788
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,360
the the work and building the right

789
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,559
pretext

790
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,919
uh one of the ones i heard it was a uh

791
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,720
it was a transportation theme that time

792
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,600
around

793
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,840
and what they did is they called up a

794
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,279
truck stop

795
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,440
that was their target and they said hey

796
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,279
this is so and so i'm from this other

797
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,159
terminal

798
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,559
we're having a real hard time um our

799
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,240
drivers can't get on the internet

800
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,480
okay and so right there that builds some

801
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,600
sort of a a

802
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,640
mind or or a thought process and the

803
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,159
person at the other terminal because

804
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,840
they can imagine what it's like

805
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,600
or maybe they've experienced what it's

806
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,880
like when

807
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,600
their people uh their drivers can't get

808
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,799
on the internet and the stress that

809
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,919
brings so all of a sudden they're

810
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:58,400
feeling

811
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,080
they're having empathy towards what's

812
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,240
going on right so this person's going i

813
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,679
don't know what happened

814
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,279
you know um we think maybe it was a

815
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,919
patch or something that happened that

816
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,600
that caused this to go bad or maybe

817
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,200
something with antivirus you know

818
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,120
are you running windows 10 still or

819
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
windows 95 and so the person tells them

820
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,080
what it is

821
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,840
okay you know and you know maybe it was

822
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,679
the antivirus that's stopping this to

823
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,240
happening

824
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,520
i'm just trying to make sure that you

825
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,120
know you you're not different set up

826
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,159
than i am

827
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,679
so it's like you know hover over the

828
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,520
little shield or whatever in the corner

829
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,880
or you use mcafee right

830
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,480
so you see what happens there they're

831
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,480
building this using empathy

832
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,679
but the story is what really drives

833
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,480
the the success here and the more the

834
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,080
more they know about these folks the

835
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,360
more they understand

836
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,679
um the more they can build camaraderie

837
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,360
even things like oh what's your name oh

838
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,600
you're joe yeah my husband's name is joe

839
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,159
or

840
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,480
you know my wife's name is sarah or

841
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,480
whatever they've used that and so that

842
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,760
builds that

843
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,400
um again that similarity that that

844
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,320
bonding between people

845
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,960
so it's it's amazing how much can happen

846
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,159
just through

847
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,320
the pretext there and again these take a

848
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,440
lot of effort

849
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,039
uh when you're doing this sort of stuff

850
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,840
but they'll do this to executives

851
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,679
we've actually done some stuff through

852
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,440
uh through know before on some paid

853
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,480
engagements

854
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,600
where we we targeted some executives we

855
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,039
had uh it was

856
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,480
i believe five minutes of uh

857
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,400
maybe it was it was five or 15 minutes

858
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,000
of um

859
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,760
studying the person gathering as much

860
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,200
information they could

861
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,039
and then doing some of these attacks you

862
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,640
wouldn't believe how many of these execs

863
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,799
fell for these things just because there

864
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,400
was something simple like

865
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,600
hey you know um uh you know they they go

866
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,120
with their school you know hey i'm an

867
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,279
alumni for this school as well um

868
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,880
you know or we're reaching out from the

869
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,799
alumni association

870
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,480
and we know that you graduated from the

871
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,240
school in this year blah blah blah they

872
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,679
start the attacks that way

873
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,360
it's amazing how that works right but

874
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,200
there's so much information about people

875
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,159
out there

876
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,480
it's really easy to make it sound real

877
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,000
now the other thing that these uh these

878
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,679
folks do these scammers do is they hide

879
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,600
their identity

880
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
i mentioned earlier it's legal to he to

881
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
do here in the us unless done

882
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,240
with the intent to defraud cause harm or

883
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,159
wrongfully obtain anything of value

884
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,200
right

885
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,880
but because of this i mean if you go out

886
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,320
and you look at uh

887
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,440
if you google id caller id changer

888
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,520
there's tons of free sites and apps and

889
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,039
stuff like that you can get

890
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,559
you can play you know jokes with your

891
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,919
friend i'm calling you from the white

892
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:26,559
house

893
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,720
stuff like that right it's just like

894
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,960
spoofing uh email

895
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,679
you know names and email it's that easy

896
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:34,640
and it's free

897
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,960
and on the right side you'll see this is

898
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
uh this is from my actual call log

899
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,600
uh on my phone now i used to live in

900
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,240
arizona

901
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,960
i lived in tucson and so i still have a

902
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,720
tucson number but yet i live

903
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,320
here in florida now and this has

904
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,559
actually worked out to my advantage

905
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,760
whenever i see a number that's a 520

906
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,520
520 area code i know it's a scam if it

907
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,960
doesn't have one of my family members

908
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,760
names on there

909
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,279
i know it's a scam so it actually makes

910
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,760
it a lot easier for me to spot those

911
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,679
uh when they come in and and almost

912
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,279
every time it's something to do with

913
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,279
your social security number

914
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,399
or something along those lines

915
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,919
and the carriers are actually getting

916
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,600
better at blocking this too

917
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,360
like the one that says scam likely up

918
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,039
there i get some of those as well

919
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,960
there's apps like robo killer and things

920
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,039
like that that you can do there as well

921
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,960
but again this spoofing like this

922
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,799
they're doing this because it's a

923
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,720
it's supposed to be a local to me phone

924
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,320
number which i'm going to think it's

925
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,080
somebody that i may know that i don't

926
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,679
have in my contacts list so i'm going to

927
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,960
want to answer it

928
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,240
but again in my case it kind of

929
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,000
backfires on them because i can easily

930
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,960
tell but

931
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,720
you see how this stuff runs in i had a

932
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,159
screenshot once of

933
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,320
the the voicemails from the social

934
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,399
security number scams and i think i had

935
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,200
six of them in two days uh just

936
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
back-to-back sort of deal

937
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,520
now what we're seeing lately uh

938
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,120
especially with the

939
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,720
covid and the you know the whole

940
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,799
pandemic thing going on

941
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,919
is a lot of calls that focus around the

942
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,200
fake vpn login portals so what they're

943
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,720
doing is they're they're calling these

944
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,000
folks up

945
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and they're saying hey this is so-and-so

946
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,440
from it

947
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,840
um you know we need you to check your

948
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,240
vpn portal we're making some changes on

949
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,159
the vpns right now

950
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,440
um you know check this out uh and so

951
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,120
basically that's what people do is they

952
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,039
they end up going to what they think is

953
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,000
a vp plugin

954
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,840
portal and a lot of times they'll do

955
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,279
they'll add like um

956
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,000
hyphen support over or either after or

957
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,320
before their actual domain name

958
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,240
um so like in our case it would be like

959
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,600
no before

960
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,520
dash support dot com or it could be

961
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,000
support no before.com

962
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,159
all of those kind of fake um

963
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,600
registrations they're doing

964
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
and they're trying to get people to go

965
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,279
there it looks like their vpn portal

966
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,039
they put in their username and password

967
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,200
they think that it's working and then

968
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,039
boom uh they've gathered their

969
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,120
credentials and you know obviously

970
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,960
with credential stuffing being a thing

971
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,240
out there we know how valuable

972
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,840
credentials are

973
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840
and it gets them access into the network

974
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,200
because they can actually hit the real

975
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,480
vpn portal

976
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,080
at that point in time but we saw a real

977
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,000
there's a real big spike in this

978
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,399
um just recently with the covet thing

979
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,360
because

980
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,360
so many people were sent home so quickly

981
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,440
and with such little guidance and i'm

982
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,760
not busting on on anyone here because

983
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,520
it's something that we had to do to

984
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,440
basically keep the wheels on the wagon

985
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,159
right

986
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,600
uh it all happened so quickly um

987
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,240
we were all kind of forced to react in

988
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,520
in some ways that

989
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,440
we didn't give everybody the training

990
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,520
they needed or the understanding that

991
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,559
they needed you know

992
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,120
you got somebody who's an older person

993
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,720
that's been working in the same job in

994
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,320
the same office for

995
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,559
you know 22 and a half years and all of

996
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,000
a sudden they're doing their job from

997
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,640
home

998
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,240
they're not used to that technology

999
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,760
they're not used to how that plays out

1000
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,520
so they took advantage of that

1001
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,000
and built these pretexts around there

1002
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,840
that are very convincing and worked very

1003
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,799
well for stealing credentials for folks

1004
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,640
so that's one of them the social

1005
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,120
security number scams like i said

1006
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,200
um i've gotten just a ton of these and

1007
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,279
they seem to go in waves

1008
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,679
and um you know everybody should know

1009
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,679
that your social security number doesn't

1010
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:14,080
get

1011
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,720
suspended due to suspicious activity it

1012
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,000
just doesn't happen that way

1013
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,880
however imagine this um you're an

1014
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,240
elderly person

1015
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,799
all right your social security income is

1016
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,799
most of what you make that's that's your

1017
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:27,279
fixed

1018
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,600
income you know for for you and me or

1019
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,440
the younger generation

1020
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,120
it's not a big deal for us we just kind

1021
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,240
of laugh about it but when they're

1022
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,880
talking about your only source of income

1023
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,360
it can be very scary and again this gets

1024
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,960
people into a system one thinking

1025
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,559
they're they're afraid oh my gosh all of

1026
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,480
my incomes at risk here because they'll

1027
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,039
say

1028
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,480
you know it's been suspended we can't

1029
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,559
pay you until we get more information

1030
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,039
i thought this was interesting in 2018

1031
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:51,919
35

1032
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,679
000 people reported this scam with

1033
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,320
losses of 10 million dollars

1034
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,000
um it's it's it's just crazy right and

1035
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,120
and we saw this

1036
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,000
we saw spikes with this too also uh when

1037
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,559
people

1038
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,080
started working from home and this is

1039
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,919
because sometimes

1040
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,760
um the protections that we would

1041
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,279
normally have in the office aren't

1042
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,960
available when people are working from

1043
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,880
home they get a hold of these other

1044
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,320
phone numbers you're forwarding your

1045
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,159
phone number to your home number

1046
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,880
etc etc there's all kinds of reasons why

1047
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,880
this happened

1048
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,080
pardon me but it can be very scary for

1049
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,120
those people so

1050
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,679
they think that this is is an issue um

1051
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:30,399
they end up

1052
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,720
it's usually a recorded message at first

1053
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,159
and then you press a number to talk to a

1054
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:34,720
person

1055
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,320
i don't know if any of you ever gone

1056
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,919
through that sort of thing and followed

1057
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,679
the the tree up a little bit

1058
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,679
i've done it a couple of times got a

1059
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,039
hold of the person like

1060
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,080
you know i'll mess with them a little

1061
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,320
bit one time i asked the guy so if my

1062
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,919
number's been suspended does that mean i

1063
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:48,480
get to

1064
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,720
stop paying into the system for a little

1065
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,399
while and i i get to keep that seven

1066
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:52,880
percent

1067
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,080
that's the point where they hung up on

1068
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,000
me but usually what it'll

1069
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,519
do is it'll ask you to press a number

1070
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,799
and then you'll end up talking to a

1071
00:32:58,799 --> 00:32:59,519
person

1072
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,679
and the people are very convincing uh

1073
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,039
the scripts that they use

1074
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,279
are are very convincing they know how to

1075
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,720
answer the questions

1076
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,760
from some of these folks that maybe not

1077
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,000
all

1078
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,760
trained up and don't understand what to

1079
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,440
ask or how it works

1080
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,120
so they'll try to get information out of

1081
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,320
them they'll try to get money out of

1082
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,519
them they'll try to get all kinds of

1083
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,480
stuff from them

1084
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,559
they want to verify the social security

1085
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,640
number is a key one there and some other

1086
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,640
information as well

1087
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,960
but these these are very very popular

1088
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,000
and they work

1089
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,519
in certain um communities as well

1090
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,960
and i brought it up a little bit here

1091
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,279
but when we look at these things and we

1092
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,880
go i don't understand how someone could

1093
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,399
call could fall for that that's just

1094
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,640
stupid you know you look at this it's

1095
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,640
clearly a scam

1096
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,720
well the the problem is for some of us

1097
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
it's something that they're unfamiliar

1098
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,919
with

1099
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,240
and they're pushed into that emotional

1100
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,279
state

1101
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,799
um the other thing that happens with

1102
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,799
these that works pretty well is with

1103
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,279
people that have newly immigrated to our

1104
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,080
country

1105
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,919
they don't understand how the processes

1106
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,080
work they don't understand that you know

1107
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,080
the irs is calling saying that you owe

1108
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,519
them money and if you don't

1109
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,159
go buy a bunch of gift cards right now

1110
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:10,719
and pay

1111
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,280
the irs and itunes gift cards you know

1112
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:13,760
um

1113
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,520
you're going to be arrested well they

1114
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,520
don't know that's not how it works here

1115
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,800
it may have worked that way in the

1116
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,000
countries that they came from

1117
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,079
right so you have these pockets of

1118
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,679
demographics that these things work

1119
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,679
extremely well on and we have to

1120
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,199
understand that and we have to cut

1121
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:27,679
people

1122
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,918
slack when they're the targets of these

1123
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,040
things

1124
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,599
and they fall for these scams because to

1125
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,520
those people at that time

1126
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,839
they're in such an emotional state it's

1127
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:38,960
really easy to do that

1128
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,399
and think about for yourself if there's

1129
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,159
been a time you've been really upset

1130
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,280
angry sad whatever

1131
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,599
any of those emotions how easy is it for

1132
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,320
you

1133
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,639
to be able to do critical thinking it's

1134
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,159
very very hard to get over in that

1135
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,440
system to thinking

1136
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,839
when you're so emotional so please let's

1137
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,280
cut people slack when we hear about

1138
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,119
these sorts of things

1139
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,320
and then there's this one i just

1140
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
couldn't resist putting this in there

1141
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,359
the car warranty scams um i get these

1142
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,920
all the time and so i i love the little

1143
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,960
meme here you know

1144
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,000
this is kind of what it feels like

1145
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,720
these are really common they're they're

1146
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,800
usually after your information or

1147
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,599
they're gonna try to

1148
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,359
sell you a warranty that doesn't exist

1149
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,359
right the thing that gets people on this

1150
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,800
is they may know the kind of car that

1151
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,440
you drive

1152
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,240
um they they use information like that

1153
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,920
that they're able to look up and find

1154
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,400
out

1155
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,599
uh on people and though they make it

1156
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,960
sound more realistic

1157
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,520
right so some of these things are public

1158
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,160
record

1159
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,560
um it's not too hard to tell you know if

1160
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,000
you've ever bought a car from like a

1161
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,960
dealership

1162
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,880
you are going to get flooded by garbage

1163
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,720
afterwards it's like heaven forbid you

1164
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,320
buy a home

1165
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,240
all of the home warranty stuff and all

1166
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,920
this other stuff you get flooded with

1167
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,040
mail afterwards

1168
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,280
these lists are sold with some of this

1169
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,160
information

1170
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,200
so they'll get a hold of this

1171
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,800
information and they'll say hey you know

1172
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,280
what

1173
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,200
i'm calling you because your 2016

1174
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,880
challenger the warranty is about to

1175
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,480
expire which it really is

1176
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,320
um you know and here's the deal blah

1177
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,400
blah blah blah sometimes again they want

1178
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,760
information sometimes they just want

1179
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,119
money they'll sell you a warranty that

1180
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,119
doesn't even really exist

1181
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,119
but they use this bit of information to

1182
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,839
build that pretext so it sounds very

1183
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,040
very realistic to folks and then we

1184
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,320
can't forget about these

1185
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,079
the tech support scams and i see them on

1186
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,680
email you know or

1187
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,920
more like the malvertising pop-ups but

1188
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,520
we also get the phone calls my wife's

1189
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,040
had the phone calls i've had the phone

1190
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,760
calls

1191
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,760
um they can be fun to mess with as well

1192
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,640
you know um but the tech support scams

1193
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,119
you know hey this is microsoft we care

1194
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,480
and that's that's the first

1195
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,560
point we we know that microsoft doesn't

1196
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
care other people may not realize that

1197
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,440
so much

1198
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,760
but uh you have a virus and we want to

1199
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,079
help you fix your computer well

1200
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,839
for some people that's that's their

1201
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,359
worst dream

1202
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,280
i'll tell you a little bit my

1203
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,599
father-in-law wonderful guy

1204
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,000
love him to death he is so paranoid with

1205
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,359
the computer he's one of these people

1206
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,480
that believes that

1207
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,640
if he leaves his computer turned on

1208
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,680
overnight

1209
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,520
uh the russians are gonna hack it right

1210
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,800
if it's connected to the internet and

1211
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,560
turn on overnight it's gonna get hacked

1212
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,200
and so

1213
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,880
he's uber paranoid about this kind of

1214
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,000
stuff so when something like this

1215
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,880
happens

1216
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,359
um you know it would get his attention

1217
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,040
that paired with the fact that

1218
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,960
my stepmom downloads every version of

1219
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,599
meijong you can possibly imagine

1220
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,359
and i've actually had to clean up her

1221
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,040
machine a number of times with things

1222
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,440
that she's got on it right mostly adware

1223
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,200
and stuff like that

1224
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,880
but now if they get a call and they say

1225
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,040
your computer is infected and

1226
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,200
you know we're here to help then they're

1227
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,960
gonna want that done now he's not very

1228
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,640
technically savvy so they may go oh

1229
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,240
click on this and this and you know he

1230
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,359
doesn't know what he's doing

1231
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,680
well let me let me do a remote access

1232
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,200
thing here just go to this website

1233
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,560
download this thing

1234
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,520
and i'll take care of it for you they're

1235
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,880
they're emotionally in a state where

1236
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,400
they think that they've got this problem

1237
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,040
going on

1238
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,599
and so therefore what do they do well

1239
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:56,720
they're going to step back and they're

1240
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,200
going to

1241
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,839
let this quote-unquote expert fix their

1242
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:00,720
problems

1243
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,640
so we see this stuff happen all the time

1244
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,480
and honestly i've seen this happen

1245
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,400
in organizations that actually had a

1246
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,680
tech support like

1247
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,079
their own i.t department but what they

1248
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,839
did is when when they went like kind of

1249
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,359
like this one here

1250
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,400
um they started talking about you know

1251
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,040
you may have gone to a site uh you know

1252
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,800
like a pornographic site or something

1253
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,520
like this

1254
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,960
and these people are all of a sudden

1255
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,040
like uh you know and they're afraid to

1256
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,920
tell

1257
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,119
their internal i.t because they're

1258
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,640
afraid they're gonna get in trouble so

1259
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,920
i've actually seen people pay

1260
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,599
out of pocket to fix quote unquote fix

1261
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,680
their computers

1262
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,359
for folks even though they have their

1263
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,800
own i.t department so that's another

1264
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,320
angle that this comes from

1265
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,839
if they've gone anywhere they think that

1266
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,200
maybe they accidentally clicked on

1267
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,560
something and it showed something weird

1268
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,680
i don't know

1269
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,200
but all of these things kind of play

1270
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,200
together in that way so

1271
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,520
again you know as security experts

1272
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,359
sometimes we look at the users and we go

1273
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:54,560
how could you fall for that

1274
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,640
right you know the irs isn't going to

1275
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,839
take gift cards we

1276
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,040
we know that but we have to understand

1277
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,520
that in the mix of these things these

1278
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,760
can be very realistic

1279
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,960
i've had some recruiter type jobs

1280
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,720
where they've said uh back when i was in

1281
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,320
arizona looking for another job you know

1282
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,680
i was active on linkedin

1283
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,960
and i had these people calling and going

1284
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,320
oh yeah you know we want to submit you

1285
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,839
for this job blah blah blah blah blah

1286
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,440
recruiter was such and such

1287
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,680
um i just need this information and the

1288
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,359
last four of your social security number

1289
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,040
and we'll submit you for the job

1290
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,839
you know and you just feel like oh like

1291
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:28,480
okay

1292
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,839
they have all the answers to why they

1293
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,520
need your last four they have all this

1294
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,480
kind of stuff

1295
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,920
but you know ultimately you just want to

1296
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,520
hang up on them but they're very very

1297
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,040
convincing on that

1298
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,560
so again they get you in that emotional

1299
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,880
state they get you emotionally involved

1300
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,560
and next thing you know they're asking

1301
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,079
you for stuff like that

1302
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,280
so how do we defend against this fun um

1303
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,480
or not so fun stuff well

1304
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,040
um it comes down to education a lot

1305
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,640
when it comes to the caller id thing

1306
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,119
people blindly trust the caller id

1307
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,440
so if it says the call is coming from

1308
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,200
the irs

1309
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,240
well they're going to believe it's

1310
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,079
coming from the irs because they don't

1311
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:06,480
know

1312
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,359
how easy it is to spoof that sort of

1313
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,040
information on caller id

1314
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,880
they assume that it's something that if

1315
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,359
it says one thing it is absolutely that

1316
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,240
thing

1317
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,160
uh so we need to let people know that

1318
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,160
this is the type of stuff that can

1319
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,880
happen

1320
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,160
that this is not something that we take

1321
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,400
you know for granted or that we

1322
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,720
understand that this is real

1323
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,920
that it is so easy to do this

1324
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,520
we also need to let people know that

1325
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,280
during certain times of the year

1326
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,480
there's going to be different kinds of

1327
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,400
scams so we need to

1328
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,960
kind of let them know that this sort of

1329
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,480
stuff is going to go on

1330
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,079
we're heading into the holidays right

1331
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,520
now we're going to see all kinds of

1332
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,480
scams

1333
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,760
uh dealing with holiday based stuff

1334
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,359
right with orders with fake websites

1335
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,760
with you know all kinds of stuff you get

1336
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,800
the delivery

1337
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,680
uh messages from fedex or whatever

1338
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,880
you're going to see a lot of that stuff

1339
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,400
in phishing but we also see it in the

1340
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,160
phone call side and the fishing side as

1341
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,720
well

1342
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,160
where they're using the stuff that

1343
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,480
people are expecting to be happening

1344
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,599
around this time of year um as their

1345
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,560
pre-tax

1346
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,319
same with the first quarter when we got

1347
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,000
tax stuff going on right

1348
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,079
so first quarter is is all about tax

1349
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,160
scams uh trying to get your social

1350
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,079
trying to get your w-2 information all

1351
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,359
that and it's in phishing it's

1352
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,160
envisioning

1353
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,000
it's in all of those different areas you

1354
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,599
know this is the irs

1355
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,680
yeah we we going through things before

1356
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,040
you file this year and we notice that

1357
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,720
you didn't file last year

1358
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,480
or that you were wrong last year now you

1359
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,240
need to pay a penalty before you can

1360
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,680
file again

1361
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,760
stuff like that we're going to see in

1362
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,960
the first quarter so

1363
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,839
let people know this tell them these are

1364
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,680
the kinds of things you can expect and

1365
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,079
just because the phone says it's the irs

1366
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,079
don't believe it you know tell them how

1367
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,640
to look up uh go online to the irs.gov

1368
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,560
and look up the phone numbers to contact

1369
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,319
and if it's real they'll be able to tell

1370
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:57,920
you at that point in time

1371
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,720
but never trust coming in that that's

1372
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,680
really like it is

1373
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,160
okay and then again like i mentioned

1374
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,480
once you know how the scam works

1375
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,880
uh you always know how to spot it let's

1376
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,440
go back to that card trick that i played

1377
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,280
even if i mixed up the kind of cards

1378
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,800
that were in there that the you know

1379
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,480
which cards were in which order or

1380
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,359
whatever

1381
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:18,880
it doesn't really matter if i tried to

1382
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,800
pull that card trick on you now

1383
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,720
you understand the mechanics of it you

1384
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,319
understand how it works

1385
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,079
even if the details change you're gonna

1386
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,839
go yeah i know what they're doing here

1387
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:28,480
right

1388
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,880
you won't fall for that same one a

1389
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,800
second time

1390
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,960
so it's important to understand like i

1391
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,720
said when we're teaching people

1392
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,640
teach them the mechanics a little bit of

1393
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,319
these don't just focus

1394
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,200
on the specific details because it will

1395
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,160
change sometimes

1396
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,839
what company they say they're calling

1397
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,680
from right and maybe they're they're

1398
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,520
calling from apple and your mac has a

1399
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,079
virus

1400
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,119
not calling from microsoft in windows or

1401
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,880
it may be something saying your phone

1402
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,160
has a virus you know there's all kinds

1403
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,160
of things like that that happen

1404
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,880
that they change the uh the pretext on

1405
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,520
it a little bit

1406
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,599
and so if we understand how it works

1407
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,119
we're much better

1408
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,720
now the key things when it comes to

1409
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,640
training people and how these attacks

1410
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,839
work both in fishing

1411
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,520
fishing smishing all that stuff

1412
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,280
these are the key things most of the

1413
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,280
times the lures that they use to pull

1414
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,960
our strings

1415
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,119
and that is greed right we've all seen

1416
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,960
the nigerian print scam that guy's been

1417
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,359
trying to give out money forever

1418
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,359
uh you know that was actually a scam

1419
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,480
before

1420
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,160
email that was something that they used

1421
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,599
to actually put in

1422
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,079
envelopes and lick stamps back when you

1423
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,520
had to lick stamps it's a horrible

1424
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,440
horrible time folks

1425
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,880
but they'd actually look stamps put them

1426
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,280
on an envelope and mail them to people

1427
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,880
and you think about what that cost them

1428
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,200
to do that versus what we can do in the

1429
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,280
modern day which is send emails for next

1430
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,040
to nothing right instead of 10 cents a

1431
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,200
stamp or whatever it was back then

1432
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,079
um as a matter of fact i was out uh not

1433
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,760
too long ago out on the dark web i was

1434
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,800
looking at some of the services

1435
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,680
available

1436
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,359
and one of the things they had was uh

1437
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,119
you know phishing services so i come up

1438
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,560
with the email i give it to them

1439
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,640
they would send it out to a list of of

1440
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,760
people that i had

1441
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,960
i could send 50 000 emails

1442
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,079
for 65 okay um

1443
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,280
you know you compare that back to the

1444
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,200
nigerian print scam where you had stamps

1445
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,319
and you were having to mail them out and

1446
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,599
print the paper and all that

1447
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,079
the cost is next to nothing now but the

1448
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,119
work on the greed part

1449
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,880
though in social media i've seen it

1450
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,640
where especially at the beginning of the

1451
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,680
pandemic there were

1452
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,839
a rash of these going around they would

1453
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,680
get into people's facebook's accounts

1454
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,760
and they would

1455
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,440
they would post to local for sale groups

1456
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,200
like here i live around a place called

1457
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,119
newport richie so like the newport

1458
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,240
richie exchange

1459
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,160
group where people would buy sell stuff

1460
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,520
and they would post up and they'd say

1461
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,760
hey check out this thing from lowe's

1462
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,040
uh for the first you know 10 recipients

1463
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,240
or whatever or

1464
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,440
they're going to pull your name out of a

1465
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,359
hat register for this you get

1466
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,319
um i think it was like what was it 10 or

1467
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,079
15 minutes or something

1468
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,920
of anything you could fit in your card

1469
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,280
is free right and they had all these

1470
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,680
kinds of different things like that

1471
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,200
and they were using that to put in there

1472
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,800
and then the person would go to the

1473
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,720
the link on there really wasn't lowe's

1474
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,920
it was a fake

1475
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,960
lowe's page on facebook

1476
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,400
and then that would take you to another

1477
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,000
site where they'd ask information

1478
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,319
and blah blah blah blah steal data et

1479
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:21,839
cetera et cetera they'd string you on

1480
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:22,400
along

1481
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,839
but that was the kind of greed thing oh

1482
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,119
look at all this stuff i can get for

1483
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,839
nothing

1484
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,400
now curiosity if you've ever seen click

1485
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,160
bait ads or you get the calls where

1486
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,200
they're

1487
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,119
where they're basically dealing with

1488
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,960
your curiosity piece so the click bait

1489
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,760
you know

1490
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,520
um you won't believe what this person is

1491
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,040
doing blah blah blah blah and there's a

1492
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,640
picture of somebody and things are

1493
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,920
circled they have nothing to do with

1494
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,880
anything

1495
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,720
or you know the top five things that

1496
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,720
cashiers want you to do

1497
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,319
number three will blow your mind that's

1498
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,880
all the curiosity type stuff

1499
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,400
and they'll get you on the calls too

1500
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,160
like that as well

1501
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,960
trying to sell you things scam you get

1502
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,640
you places like that curiosity is a

1503
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,720
great way to do that self-interest you

1504
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,800
know things that are going to help you

1505
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,000
things that are good for you and of

1506
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,079
course urgency

1507
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,040
now in fishing or wishing or smishing i

1508
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,680
have never

1509
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,680
personally seen an attack come through

1510
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,000
that said whenever you get around to

1511
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,319
it call us back or you know think about

1512
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,160
it for a couple days and get back to me

1513
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,079
that's never going to happen

1514
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,760
there's always a sense of urgency and

1515
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,200
that keeps us in that system one

1516
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,000
thinking

1517
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,599
where we're emotionally charged and

1518
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,040
again that's very error prone when

1519
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,400
you're in there

1520
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,319
and then fear of course fear of being

1521
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,319
thrown in jail fear of being arrested if

1522
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:32,960
you don't

1523
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,240
send those itunes gift cards to the irs

1524
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,240
those are fantastic ways to get people

1525
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,400
going and

1526
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,000
in the psychology side to get people to

1527
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,040
do an action two of the the most

1528
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,160
uh powerful attacks or the the two most

1529
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,760
powerful emotions i know of to drive

1530
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,200
people into an action

1531
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,599
are anger and outrage because people

1532
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,280
will back away from fear as often as

1533
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,560
they'll push up against it

1534
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,560
but if you can get somebody outraged or

1535
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,200
angry you can get them to do something

1536
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,200
so like in the political world what we

1537
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,720
have going on right now

1538
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,640
you get somebody upset you get somebody

1539
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,079
angry you tell them that

1540
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,839
hey here's a petition to stop whatever

1541
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,280
it is i told you that they're doing and

1542
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,800
again it doesn't matter what side you're

1543
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,280
on

1544
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,599
um here's a petition and then they go to

1545
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:18,880
this place and to make sure that it's

1546
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,559
valid we need your social security

1547
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:21,119
number

1548
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,359
you know your date of birth the name of

1549
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,200
your first pet your mom's maiden name

1550
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,640
and people are like yeah i want to make

1551
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,319
sure this is valid right

1552
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,920
people will put in that information if

1553
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,520
you get them riled up enough they don't

1554
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,119
even notice what it is they're putting

1555
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,880
in there is dangerous

1556
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,760
and then of course helpfulness right so

1557
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,319
um

1558
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:39,440
we're going to see this around the

1559
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,319
holidays you know help the homeless help

1560
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,720
people that don't have as much as you uh

1561
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,400
during the holidays we see

1562
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,280
um anytime there's a natural disaster or

1563
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,960
unnatural disaster

1564
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,359
you see these fake charities popping up

1565
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,079
uh you get

1566
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,400
phone calls from people that are trying

1567
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,599
to solicit

1568
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,000
for these charities you know this is so

1569
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,920
and so with such and such i'm collecting

1570
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,200
on the behalf of

1571
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,680
such and such church who's dealing with

1572
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,400
the after

1573
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,440
after effects of this hurricane right uh

1574
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,359
you look at louisiana who's just been

1575
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,119
hammered by hurricane after hurricane

1576
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,800
after hurricane this year

1577
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,800
a lot of that stuff in those areas

1578
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,720
there's a lot of scams going on around

1579
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,920
that type of stuff so that's where the

1580
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,400
helpfulness stuff comes in too

1581
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,400
so these are all kind of the key things

1582
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,000
that they use to manipulate us

1583
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,359
and we got to teach people that when

1584
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,520
they get a phone call they get a text

1585
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,880
message or they get a

1586
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,599
an email that elicits a strong emotional

1587
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:34,160
response

1588
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,480
this is where we need to step back take

1589
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,520
a breath

1590
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,920
and try to apply that critical thinking

1591
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,760
get out of that system one and into the

1592
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,040
system two thing

1593
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,040
and look at this in a critical way

1594
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,640
detach from the emotions

1595
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,000
and that's where you start seeing the

1596
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,319
holes in what's going on so

1597
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,880
this is important to tell people to make

1598
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,640
them understand that these are designed

1599
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,160
to get them emotional

1600
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,319
and that's kind of the thing behind it

1601
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,760
so that's about all i have for slides

1602
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,280
right now i want to go to questions if

1603
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,119
we have any questions

1604
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,960
i kind of see a few running through

1605
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,480
discord here but i

1606
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,000
am not great at keeping up on these

1607
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,599
sorts of things so

1608
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:13,200
um got any questions for me

1609
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,960
and you're muted john i can't hear you

1610
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,559
let me find my mute button there we go

1611
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:19,119
yeah yeah

1612
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,720
brilliant so i and that this wasn't in

1613
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,400
discord as a question actually for me

1614
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,920
should i feel guilty utilizing these

1615
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,559
tactics in my security awareness

1616
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,079
training

1617
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,640
yeah um so that's a huge thing because i

1618
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,640
don't i feel terrible now no no that's

1619
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,480
that's a that's a tough side of this

1620
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,680
um and it goes the same with the

1621
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,200
phishing emails and the vishing and

1622
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,400
stuff like that

1623
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,640
so the key is first of all you have to

1624
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,240
understand why are you doing it

1625
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,160
and when it comes to this sort of stuff

1626
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,319
what i always want to tell people is

1627
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,559
you know we're not doing this to trick

1628
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,000
the users that's not

1629
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,599
why we're doing these sorts of things

1630
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,200
it's not really to trick them

1631
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,200
it's really all about taking basically

1632
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,880
what we've trained them

1633
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,040
and give them a chance to practice that

1634
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,720
in a fail-safe environment whether it's

1635
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,839
through the calls

1636
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,520
whether it's through the text messages

1637
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,440
or whether it's through the emails

1638
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,599
we're trying to help them do that and we

1639
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,440
want to be very careful

1640
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,960
with what we're doing we want to tell

1641
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,200
people up front that hey

1642
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,200
we know that this is going on we want to

1643
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,880
make sure that you're safe

1644
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,040
and you're going to be subjected to

1645
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,559
these things you always want to tell

1646
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,079
them that these things are coming in

1647
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,240
right you don't ever want to start doing

1648
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,400
these sorts of tactics against folks

1649
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,839
without letting them know it's going to

1650
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,599
happen because then they'll be upset

1651
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,599
but what you don't do is you don't i'm a

1652
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,400
big i'm a big proponent of carrot over

1653
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,680
stick right so you reward the good

1654
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,720
behaviors

1655
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,400
and then you help the people when you do

1656
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,400
this with okay these are the things you

1657
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,680
could have looked at these are the

1658
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,319
things that

1659
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:50,640
that could have been a clue to this in

1660
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,400
there and you help them learn

1661
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,079
but also let them know how this is going

1662
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,599
to help them in their personal life as

1663
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:56,960
well and then they don't feel like

1664
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,440
you're just

1665
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,800
out out to mess with them now

1666
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,400
you have to be careful some of the lines

1667
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,319
that you cross in some of the things

1668
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,559
that you would use as pretexts

1669
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,680
right you try not to use their family in

1670
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,400
a pretext

1671
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,240
right like i have your child you'll

1672
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,920
never see him again

1673
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,000
you fell for that right nobody's going

1674
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,200
to be happy about that one

1675
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,200
all right that's the reason generating

1676
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,200
event right that is a resume generating

1677
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,440
event depends on their kid

1678
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,280
well yeah some of them may be like hey

1679
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,520
i'm saving money now you know

1680
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,400
um but you know we have to be cognizant

1681
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,000
of that and we have to understand what

1682
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,640
it is

1683
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,880
anytime we're doing a deception-based

1684
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,400
training like this

1685
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,079
we really have to be careful and

1686
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,160
understand um

1687
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,839
what that's going to be around so stick

1688
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,680
with the the stuff that's out there

1689
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,599
only use information if you're going to

1690
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,280
do a pretext on 70 and you're going to

1691
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:47,599
do

1692
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,000
something that's very targeted only use

1693
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,599
real publicly

1694
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,079
available information don't get into the

1695
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,440
stuff that you have in their personnel

1696
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,359
files and stuff like that because

1697
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,119
that's not a fair thing to do either

1698
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,680
right no it's and

1699
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,000
we aren't for instance in my current

1700
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,359
employment we're not allowed to use

1701
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:06,160
covid as

1702
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,520
a as a fishing vector um now i can give

1703
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,359
away free pumpkin spice lattes

1704
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:14,240
and that one is painfully effective but

1705
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,920
we're

1706
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,839
sad really it's disappointing but i want

1707
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,760
one yeah i'm not

1708
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,920
i'm not allowed to do anything medical

1709
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,520
like that i'm not allowed to instill

1710
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,000
fear

1711
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,559
and i initially i thought man this is

1712
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,079
this is the perfect vector this is

1713
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,760
what's going to get somebody to click a

1714
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,200
link

1715
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,960
and it's that curiosity it drops

1716
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,640
curiosity it drives fear

1717
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,680
but it can also be part of the outrage

1718
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,240
yep and here's the problem with that is

1719
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,640
when you are limited like that

1720
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,319
you know the attackers are using that

1721
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,720
like we saw a huge uptick in covet

1722
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,720
related phishing in the beginning and

1723
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,079
it's still going on right

1724
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:51,839
um you know that's their attack vector

1725
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,960
so if you tell people that's off limits

1726
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,559
um you know it it kind of it kind of

1727
00:52:58,559 --> 00:52:59,760
limits what you can do with folks and

1728
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,040
it's really hard because

1729
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,559
those are the real attacks they're going

1730
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,720
to be facing and so

1731
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,480
i understand that's a challenge some

1732
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,920
places you know it's how much

1733
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,440
risk they want to do because we we

1734
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,440
actually saw a situation

1735
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,440
not too long ago it was with a a

1736
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,520
newspaper i believe

1737
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,680
that had been laying off a whole bunch

1738
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,880
of people

1739
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,720
and then they sent out something about

1740
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,760
um it was about like christmas bonuses

1741
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,880
for folks and it was a phishing email

1742
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,760
and of course it just went stupid like

1743
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,200
oh you're laying off people and blah

1744
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,079
blah and then you're going to turn

1745
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:33,920
around and do this

1746
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,520
and you know it actually hit twitter

1747
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,200
pretty decent and

1748
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,880
you know that's one of those things you

1749
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,119
got to understand where the limits are

1750
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,760
with your organization as well as just

1751
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,240
kind of the ethical side

1752
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,720
also on assessments i've seen where

1753
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,359
things like

1754
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,920
porn and gambling are not in scope and

1755
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,559
it's it's

1756
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,359
foreboding to do that sort of thing i'm

1757
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:56,000
looking in

1758
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,359
the uh in the discord for questions does

1759
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,319
anyone have any questions

1760
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,000
actually i do have a i have a question

1761
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,599
so somebody in discord mentioned that

1762
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,119
they like to mess with them and i think

1763
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,000
it's a

1764
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
very popular pastime for many of us but

1765
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,680
number one i don't think you'd recommend

1766
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,720
your you do that at a corporation

1767
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,520
do you have some yeah yeah that's

1768
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,960
wasting time and money although

1769
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,880
it still is fun but do you have any

1770
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,559
recommendations for people how to handle

1771
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,079
it do you recommend people mess with

1772
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,000
them or

1773
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,280
i generally don't um especially

1774
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,000
especially your end users right um these

1775
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,040
are people that

1776
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,680
that can you know they can get in there

1777
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,200
when i get these calls now

1778
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,960
and i know it's going to be something

1779
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,319
like those the ones that i get from

1780
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,079
arizona all the time i just end the call

1781
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:47,359
i don't even want to get on the phone

1782
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:48,640
because i don't want to validate that

1783
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,640
that's a real number either

1784
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,319
right so i don't want to validate that

1785
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,000
i'm the person there they may ask me a

1786
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,240
question hey is this eric yeah it's eric

1787
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,079
and then you go mess with them well you

1788
00:54:58,079 --> 00:54:59,440
know if you don't know in the beginning

1789
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,280
you're giving up information like that

1790
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,720
i just don't recommend it and there's

1791
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,640
some argument for wasting their time and

1792
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,200
so

1793
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,119
the time on the call with you is time

1794
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,280
that they wouldn't be with someone else

1795
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,760
and i get that i just i want to say be

1796
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,799
very cautious

1797
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,200
when you do that because you may be

1798
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,000
opening yourself

1799
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,839
up to to other issues and and perhaps

1800
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:20,160
repercussions um

1801
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,400
not that i'm paranoid again i i've done

1802
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,240
it i love to mess with those folks

1803
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,799
but i don't recommend everybody do it

1804
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:27,520
something

1805
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,799
and i don't know what the legality of

1806
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:29,920
this is i probably had to look it up

1807
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,359
before i speak

1808
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,160
the dtmf towns the ones that uh indicate

1809
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:34,880
a call

1810
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,920
cannot be completed yeah yeah i used to

1811
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,440
put that in my voicemail

1812
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,160
oh nice nice i like that i like this hey

1813
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,440
if you guys want to see something funny

1814
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,359
i think it's on youtube it's uh this is

1815
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:45,920
lenny

1816
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,559
have you all ever seen that it's a it's

1817
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:49,839
a voice prompt system

1818
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,640
for um astric phones uh like an asterisk

1819
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,160
pbs

1820
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,799
and basically it's designed to screw

1821
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,880
with telemarketers and scammers

1822
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,799
and it's this old guy and he starts out

1823
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:02,160
this is lenny

1824
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,920
and they start you know he starts just

1825
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,760
like going off on these tangents and

1826
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,440
stuff like that and it's just to mess

1827
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,480
with these folks

1828
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,839
and keep them online so people just

1829
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,359
forward them to that that asterisk

1830
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:12,319
mailbox

1831
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,079
and move on that's not a person on there

1832
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,319
so i'm more okay with that but there are

1833
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,240
some hilarious ones where they're just

1834
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,000
screwing with these guys for

1835
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,640
10 15 minutes uh and they record these

1836
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,240
calls and the guys finally just

1837
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,839
they lose their minds over it it's

1838
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:28,480

1840
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,200
you respond to a spam email it's classic

1841
