1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,040
so uh colleague and criminal justice

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,720
and one of the criminal justice um

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,080
graduate assistants so basically what

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,360
we're doing is we're looking at the

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,960
motivations of anonymous through a

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,639
theoretical lens

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,720
in this case we looked at neutralization

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,760
theory

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,880
to try to

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,119
talk about why anonymous did what they

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:25,519
did

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,000
over the years so we actually went back

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,920
this is part two of a previous study

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,760
where we

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,840
surveyed some of the literature to come

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,800
up with

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,879
some quotes we looked at

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,719
public utterances newspaper articles

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,960
even we did documentaries one of the

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,399
things the graduate student did was

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,360
actually transcribe

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,039
documentaries uh and we're looking at

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,120
the type of neutralizations used among

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,480
these individuals who

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,960
identified as anonymous uh beginning of

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,480
operations from 2008 through 2013

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,199
so basically you have the gambit from um

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,360
operation chanology through the summer

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,799
of laws

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,640
and all those people you think of when

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,159
you talk about anonymous

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,920
during that period of time such as

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,200
sabu the

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
paypal operatives all those people that

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,439
were doing the ddosing at paypal

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,320
right up through uh right up through the

37
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,119
uh antisec which was lost

38
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,840
becoming antisec after cebu was flipped

39
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,320
uh

40
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,079
so that's the whole period of time we

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,439
looked at

42
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,720
visualization theory is um

43
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,520
it was based on a study in 1957 and

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,720
basically it said

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,759
that offenders use

46
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,479
verbal or nonverbal utterances prior to

47
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,240
committing an act of violence a

48
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,240
violation of law or values to which they

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,920
claim to follow

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,320
so basically you can type

51
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,640
people's motivation motivations based

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,520
upon

53
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,360
these neutrals theory neutralization

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,319
theory framework

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,480
so neutralization theory allows people

56
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,000
to temporarily

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,680
suspend judgment deflect blame

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,000
cast aside feelings of getter negative

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,879
self-image

60
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,000
or justify his or her action uh through

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,280
the cleansing of the conscious

62
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,319
there are a number of types of

63
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,239
neutralization and these are the ones

64
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,200
that we used

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,920
and we went back to monsanto sites and

66
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,640
we looked

67
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,160
at denial of responsibility denial of

68
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,200
injury

69
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,000
denial of the victim condiment

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,120
combination

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,360
combination condemnation of the

72
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,440
condemners

73
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,080
so that's like those people are wrong so

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,800
therefore

75
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,319
we're doing what's right so we're

76
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,080
condemning their actions because

77
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,599
they um they're on

78
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,120
they're on the side of the side of wrong

79
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,120
and we're on the side of right

80
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,159
appealing to higher authorities somebody

81
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,599
made me do this or

82
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,518
i was someone

83
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,480
motivated me to do to do this whatever

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,080
that action is

85
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,000
there's the metaphor of the ledger which

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,280
is that

87
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,680
when you add it all up i come down on

88
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,560
the side of good

89
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,760
not bad claim of normality

90
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,879
it's normal to engage in this behavior

91
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,879
diffusion of guilt everyone else is

92
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,159
doing it

93
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,280
defense of necessity i did what was

94
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,959
required of me a claim of relative

95
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,879
acceptability

96
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,200
justification of comparison and that's

97
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,959
another one where everyone else is doing

98
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:49,519
it

99
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,280
and postponement there were the

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,120
additional neutralizations we looked at

101
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,239
so we talked about the history of

102
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,720
anonymous and uh

103
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,319
doing things through laws we talked

104
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,720
about the trolling attacks of anonymous

105
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,239
um a habra hotel where they would form

106
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,120
themselves in the shape of the swastika

107
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,879
um and just uh different trolling things

108
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,399
they've done over the years

109
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,759
so anonymous originated with b

110
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,400
and and and what is you know what became

111
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,520
anonymous was

112
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,560
actually not a group

113
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,720
with a leader it was just a group of

114
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,919
people who would

115
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,840
act uh out in hacktivist ways

116
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,040
hacktivist is basically activism is

117
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,120
it's hacking for political reasons it's

118
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,360
us usually seen as an act of protest

119
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,479
um so in the case of 4chan

120
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,240
you know that's that's where anonymous

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,759
comes from comes when you post there

122
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,600
everyone's anonymous no one posts with

123
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,240
their name

124
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,880
so they were sitting around thinking oh

125
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,639
wouldn't be funny if we just

126
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,360
identified ourselves as anonymous as

127
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,880
this one person

128
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,560
but many people who are

129
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,560
feel disenfranchised with the government

130
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,720
the corporate elite

131
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,639
and when they involved into taking

132
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,880
political and social action

133
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,560
whether it was internet in person

134
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,240
probably chenology was the biggest

135
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,360
uh one of those operations which was

136
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,960
um against the church of scientology

137
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,919
um to sort of call out their church of

138
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,799
scientology's

139
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,240
bs the church of scientology's

140
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,639
ridiculousness as they saw it

141
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,680
the church of scientology's sort of cult

142
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,560
status

143
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,919
and how they would and still continue to

144
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,280
this day

145
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,400
will will basically

146
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,199
surveil anyone who talks out against

147
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:49,840
them

148
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,600
they'll attempt to ruin the lives of

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,240
people who talk out against them

150
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,639
so anonymous is like hey this is not

151
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,400
good we're going to go after them and

152
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,759
basically

153
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,600
there was this video with tom cruise

154
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,440
talking about scientology that was

155
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,600
leaked on the internet

156
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,520
and church scientology kept taking it

157
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,720
down

158
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,800
and then the people people in anonymous

159
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,440
kept just putting it up again

160
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,120
over and over and over they couldn't get

161
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,479
it down and then they got

162
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,039
mad they kept taking this video down

163
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,639
that they were making fun of and they

164
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,520
started trolling the church

165
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,199
in person by actually going to

166
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,680
scientologists churches and protesting

167
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,199
outside an anonymous mask

168
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,639
by jamming up the dianetics hotlines

169
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,800
they would call and say things like

170
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,919
what's an lron um

171
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,520
how do i dianetics my face

172
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,479
um so this was really the first

173
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,240
operation anonymous took place in and

174
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,039
then it

175
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,599
went on after that uh there were

176
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,160
different

177
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,240
uh wrongs that they found on the

178
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,319
internet once they figured out they had

179
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,280
power as a collective they they started

180
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,000
trying to write

181
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,759
all the wrongs that they could find on

182
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,360
the internet and as a result they were

183
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,000
also very busy because there's a lot of

184
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,160
perceived wrongs on the internet so

185
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,520
scientology

186
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,880
uh and operation chanology is the first

187
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,080
example of this

188
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,520
and one of the best books um about

189
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,240
anonymous

190
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,240
was is by gabrielle coleman which i've

191
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,039
used in classes before

192
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,240
and it's just called anonymous hacker

193
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,599
hoaxer whistleblower spy uh

194
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,240
and the two main characters that not

195
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,759
characters are real people and the two

196
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,520
main people that she talks to are the

197
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,000
sabu the leader of lost sec

198
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,759
and um she also

199
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,080
talks to other people who took part in

200
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,479
his actions gabrielle coleman is a

201
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,520
as a sociologist and she used

202
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,800
mainly quantitative methods

203
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,879
by becoming a part of the group she

204
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,160
actually hung out

205
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,599
on the on these uh on on these

206
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,120
4chan anonymous um

207
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,240
irc channels and and and they adopted

208
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,720
her as their historian

209
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,000
after the book was published there's a

210
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,840
lot of people who broke ranks with her

211
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,520
cebu was an example saying that

212
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,080
basically she was just using him to get

213
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,560
her

214
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,639
her research done which um

215
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,960
you know cebu met with her when he was

216
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,560
still actively participating in

217
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,479
operations and and told her a bunch of

218
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,479
stuff that ended up in the book

219
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,399
uh barrett browns and other persons she

220
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,240
talks about there's also a movie

221
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,360
um that's really good called hacker wars

222
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,279
i think you could probably still it was

223
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,120
on netflix

224
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,540
i believe it's still on amazon

225
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,600
[Music]

226
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,040
and you can probably find it bootlegged

227
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,160
by other members of anonymous on

228
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,200
on youtube but those are two great

229
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,640
resources

230
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,040
so anonymous participation is fluid you

231
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,640
might be part of the

232
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,880
collective for a while but then drop out

233
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,000
at another time you might

234
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,440
not agree with the the way that

235
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,080
the flock of birds is flying at that

236
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,800
moment

237
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,279
membership is global you don't have a

238
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,880
membership card if you want to be a

239
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,320
member of anonymous

240
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,720
you take uh an active role in their

241
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
denial service attacks

242
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,000
their hacking attacks or the website

243
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,120
defacements on

244
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,080
another thing they've been known to use

245
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,680
no one no there's no hierarchy or

246
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,240
leadership

247
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,640
there's no leader per se that was sort

248
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,240
of the thing about when

249
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,440
um when

250
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,080
operation laws started happening and you

251
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,360
had

252
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,720
had cebu claim be the leader

253
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,560
of uh of a hacking group uh he

254
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,399
anonymous pushed back against that he

255
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,320
was a member of

256
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,279
of a subsection of of uh of anonymous

257
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,880
but he did not represent all of

258
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,320
anonymous

259
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,079
so that goes directly against the no no

260
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,079
hierarchy or leadership

261
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,079
so lawsack is considered to be an

262
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,079
anonymous subgroup but not

263
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,279
anonymous itself none of them claim to

264
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,920
be hackers and activists and there are

265
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,440
cases where people just downloaded

266
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,320
the high earth

267
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,839
basically they would download loc

268
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,560
for example which is this denial of

269
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,000
service attack

270
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,640
tool and would just use it because they

271
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,360
um

272
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,600
they thought what was going on was wrong

273
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,920
another operation was operation paypal

274
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,839
paypal stops accepting money

275
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,640
for certain certain organizations mainly

276
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,000
wikileaks

277
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,480
so anonymous was like this is not right

278
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,839
and they started

279
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,800
launching denial service attacks against

280
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,560
credit card

281
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,240
processors against paypal itself and for

282
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,279
days at a time

283
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,800
it's knocking them off the web

284
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,720
and a lot of people who were actually

285
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,399
arrested for that

286
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,839
were high school students

287
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,600
some some dude living in the midwest

288
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,360
working on his parents farm

289
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,720
they just became hacktivist or they

290
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,320
became activists based upon the

291
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,680
opportunity

292
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,680
that they had to to do something and

293
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,880
they felt that it was

294
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,680
easy to sit in their living room or

295
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,200
bedroom they download these tools and

296
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,120
launch denial service attacks and it was

297
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,680
the

298
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,800
march around with signs non-operations

299
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,760
were involved in legal activity

300
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,680
some of it was a letter-writing campaign

301
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
some of it was sending faxes the church

302
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,440
of scientology

303
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,800
so it wasn't anything particularly

304
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
illegal

305
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,000
and basically we consider an honest to

306
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,360
be a hacktivist group

307
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,040
and online activism

308
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,519
so here's the operations synology

309
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,480
payback

310
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,760
avenge assange h.b gary was really the

311
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,000
first subu operation

312
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,360
they were able to social engineer

313
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,279
um the people were basically the help

314
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:13,760
desk

315
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,040
at hb gary and someone was able to

316
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,320
pose as the ceo of h.b gary they

317
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,839
stole a bunch of documents saying that

318
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,000
h.b gary was going to infiltrate

319
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,720
anonymous using journalists and other

320
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,920
activities and they

321
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,000
basically dropped docs and all this

322
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,440
published it on pastebin

323
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,040
and embarrassed the hell out of the

324
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,480
company

325
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,079
operation technology we talked about

326
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,079
that's a scientology operation payback

327
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,800
operation of binge assange really has to

328
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,399
do with anonymous

329
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,399
going to bat for wikileaks

330
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,160
and things that wikileaks were doing and

331
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,839
the fact that wikileaks could no longer

332
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:50,720
get

333
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,279
contributions through paypal

334
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,800
walsek antisex so uh law sec

335
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,760
summer of 2012 after cebu gets pinched

336
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,440
by the fbi

337
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,920
uh becomes state's witness it turns the

338
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,880
group into antisec

339
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,920
stratfor stratfor is a defense

340
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,680
contractor that sells information

341
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,560
and that was a jeremy hammond who was

342
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,920
still in prison

343
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,120
for that and jeremy hammond and also

344
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,360
barrett brown who were involved and cebu

345
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,959
was involved somehow

346
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,360
the the people who have problems with

347
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,560
the stratfor hack

348
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,600
is that at the time stratfor hack

349
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,760
cebu who gave them information to break

350
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,639
in to

351
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,199
uh stratfor was actually working for the

352
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,399
fbi's in

353
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,360
format so there are some who would claim

354
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,079
that

355
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,920
um that people like barrett brown

356
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,839
and um and jeremy hammond

357
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,600
uh were framed

358
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,000
operation red rolls do you know what

359
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,720
operation

360
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,560
red roll is anyone

361
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,839
i'll tell you what when you use our

362
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:17,839
google machine we can find out

363
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,560
we just spelt right

364
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,839
so this is the stupid bill rake case um

365
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,279
where basically

366
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,279
this one guy went after uh

367
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,800
went after the perpetrators who were

368
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
basically on the football team

369
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
of a 16 year old girl by two high school

370
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,639
football players nothing was really ever

371
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,680
done

372
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,079
but this guy ended up in jail for uh

373
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,638
basically

374
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,240
defacing the school's website

375
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,320
and and and dropping docs on these

376
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,440
people um

377
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,079
so he was

378
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,680
there's all this he basically just kept

379
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,519
that and kept at it until uh the

380
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,600
perpetrators went to jail

381
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,480
uh school superintendent was arrested on

382
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,000
felony charges tampering with evidence

383
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,519
and obstructing justice

384
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,360
uh this guy um is actually was in

385
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,720
lexington kentucky and uh

386
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,079
i've sort of lost track of where he is

387
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,759
his nickname was ky anonymous

388
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,560
um he also did battle with westboro

389
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,519
baptist church

390
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,480
anonymous i did a lot of battles with

391
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,360
westboro baptist church

392
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,279
so he had been a member of anonymous

393
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,639
anonymous doing

394
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,120
the operations against um westbrook

395
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,800
baptist church and then gotten

396
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,279
involved with steubenville uh the

397
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,560
student bill ohio case

398
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,680
let me close this

399
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,100
um

400
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,169
[Music]

401
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,000
and then operation last resort and that

402
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
has to do with uh

403
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,880
aaron schwartz uh aaron schwartz

404
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,160
was arrested by the fbi and prosecuted

405
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,240
for basically taking

406
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,360
academic research and publishing it in

407
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,880
on the open web um so he was actually

408
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,600
putting laptops in the wiring closet at

409
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,399
the library at mit

410
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,560
he was busted for it and they were going

411
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,320
to prosecute him and he ended up hanging

412
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,040
himself in a cell before it ever went

413
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,320
to trial but aaron schwartz

414
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,920
was one of the co-founders of reddit

415
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,399
was an activist from very early so

416
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,759
operation last resort

417
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,360
was to extract revenge to what

418
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,720
for what happened aaron schwartz

419
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
so we spent uh probably about three

420
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,720
years establishing a database of

421
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,639
anonymous operations united states and

422
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:00,959
the

423
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,600
individuals affiliated with this when

424
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,199
you're doing this sort of research

425
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,240
it gets really kind of crazy

426
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,240
you have to do some typography you have

427
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,520
to take

428
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,880
data and you have to you have to

429
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,079
organize

430
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,520
and you have to assign

431
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,599
data uh to a specific

432
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,119
in this case we had to assign it to a

433
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,640
specific

434
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,120
neutralization and we had the find and

435
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,720
neutralization

436
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,760
match the public utterance um so in this

437
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,240
case we had 47 anonymous

438
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,799
participated in one or more operation

439
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,919
medium age was 26 years of age with a

440
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,600
with a range of 16 to 65

441
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,720
ninety-five percent of them are were uh

442
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,919
45 of them were male no geographical

443
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,559
pattern

444
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,320
there are some members of anonymous who

445
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,840
lived in the uk

446
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,880
11 topiary would be an example of that

447
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,960
who lived in uk he lived on the isle man

448
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,720
i believe

449
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,880
and he was just basically a teenager

450
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,720
who's a latch key kid

451
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,960
who drank too much and decided to screw

452
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,160
around on computer

453
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,600
and the next thing you know he's a

454
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,559
member of lawsack

455
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,960
there were four residents of california

456
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,880
forza new york and the remainder lived

457
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,240
in 17 different states

458
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,559
there was 36 participants in anonymous

459
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,320
operations that were charged with file

460
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,400
the federal computer fraud and abuse

461
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,600
acts so

462
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,840
of all the people that took place that

463
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,039
took part

464
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,600
we looked at 37 members but not all of

465
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,039
them were prosecuted

466
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,520
so our methods for sphinx phase two was

467
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,600
open source and techniques to collect

468
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,000
all the written remarks or to transcribe

469
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,919
mark remarks from

470
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,919
film or from recorded uh interviews

471
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,440
written comments were found for

472
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,799
31 or 66 percent of the 47 anonymous

473
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,000
operation

474
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,520
participants we had over 55 pages of

475
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,919
text and 13 000 words for an

476
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,799
analysis so we used latent coding

477
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,440
for the third phase of the study where

478
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,200
we

479
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,400
the coders were trained and then

480
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,640
we sat down and we started coding all

481
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,400
these different phrases

482
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,200
we had to cut all these things that were

483
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,559
paragraphs long

484
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,640
we have to find the paragraph that we

485
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,160
were interested in

486
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,520
separate that and then code it

487
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
the overall reliability coefficient is

488
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,039
0.94 0.92 for coded neutralizations

489
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,080
um and this is based on the work of

490
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,520
kryptor which um the other people in the

491
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,200
study got mad because i called it double

492
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,160
door

493
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,200
but that's just the way i am

494
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,120
so 26 percent fell in the

495
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,760
con i can't talk all of a sudden

496
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,960
um combination of the condemners so

497
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,799
that's 26 percent

498
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,679
or 62 members and it they said things

499
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,320
like should

500
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,440
police should um please should

501
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,360
should police have obtained a reasonable

502
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,200
to reason to acquire information but

503
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,039
lacking any overt evidence

504
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,120
of criminality to bring prosecution to

505
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,559
be allowed to withhold

506
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,520
private data and specifically in the

507
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,559
case of stratfor

508
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,600
i agreed law enforcement system they

509
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,120
believe the law enforcement system is

510
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,760
racist

511
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,520
and and equal there's too much

512
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,990
inequality

513
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,480

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,000
and they they targeted a manufacturer

515
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,480
they basically want to take police

516
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,559
demilitarize the police as part of the

517
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,919
material this is some of the things

518
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,360
we're hearing now

519
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,480
um uh

520
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,080
and they block they believe that there's

521
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,120
this cyber we you know

522
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,360
it was dwight eifenhower howard who said

523
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,960
beware of the military-industrial

524
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,200
complex

525
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,559
members of an anonymous saw this

526
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,520
sort of growth not just in a military

527
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,240
industrial conflict but in the cyber

528
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,280
military industrial complex um

529
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,520
basically cyber security has become more

530
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,360
militarized and they see

531
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,880
firms like stratfor as

532
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,280
one of the bad actors in this

533
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,559
militarization

534
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,159
of things like us police departments

535
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,559
the misuse of information as they see it

536
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,159
uh that violates people pro

537
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,520
people's privacy um and that's

538
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,840
that's condemnation of the condemners

539
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,720
that's

540
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,720
appeal to hire more to 30 authority

541
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,840
that's 14

542
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,679
or 33. um

543
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,440
they believe that they what they did was

544
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,280
right and they would do it again because

545
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,640
it was morally correct to do

546
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,240
here's the case where now that pleaded

547
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,840
guilty it's relief to be able to say

548
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,679
that i did work with the anonymous to

549
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,960
atta to hack stratfor

550
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,960
one of the sub things with civil

551
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,880
disobedient obedience so we talked about

552
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,919
loc

553
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,559
which is the low orbit ion cannon it's a

554
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,158
software that will basically

555
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,600
take down a website by constantly

556
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,400
sending it traffic

557
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,240
and in this case uh

558
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,720
the participant said all i did was leave

559
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,600
the loc

560
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,120
or low or low orbit ion cannon software

561
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,559
running on my computer

562
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,200
because i viewed it as a way of donating

563
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,760
to support the cause i believed in

564
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,840
which press that was protesting against

565
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,720
visa mastercard paypal

566
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,120
because of financial blockade uh

567
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,400
wikileaks

568
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,320
so you know the thing about i remember

569
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,679
this operation

570
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,320
uh this operation well because it took

571
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,840
down my

572
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,320
took down my network i was working at a

573
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,280
law firm for

574
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,039
a regional law firm and mastercard

575
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,360
uh had was using some of the

576
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,080
same vpns or privately routed networks

577
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,039
that we were to

578
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,960
send information back between us

579
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,799
morgantown and wheeling

580
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,760
and it actually took us offline so

581
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,480
sometimes

582
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,120
civil disobedience uh and when you're

583
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,799
doing stuff like this

584
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,760
they actually did more than just take

585
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,080
pay

586
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,120
pal mastercard and visa offline they

587
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,760
took my

588
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,039
my little law firm offline as well

589
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,720
other people said things like i broke

590
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,240
the law but i believe that was something

591
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,080
laws must be broken in order to make

592
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,799
room for change

593
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,880
denial the victim the the victimless

594
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,600
crime

595
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,440
12 or 27 members of anonymous

596
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,200
said they did it because there were no

597
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
victims

598
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,440
uh they said basically stratfor uh

599
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,279
you know they engaged in activities that

600
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,640
they weren't

601
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,400
particularly happy about and they were

602
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,360
deserving target

603
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,720
um another anonymous building said

604
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,320
another anonymous member said they were

605
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,799
happy because what they did

606
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,880
was to stand up to a bully they said

607
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,039
that stratfor was a bully or

608
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,679
in some cases if you look at operation

609
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:26,960
paypal

610
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,200
they thought paypal and visa mascard was

611
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,279
a bully

612
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,159
um i think here's another one i think

613
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,760
what was more important for lawsec at

614
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,440
least was showing the world how these

615
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,960
major corporations

616
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,200
weren't following the basic security

617
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,559
well

618
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,240
okay but i don't want to stand like

619
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,159
kevin johnson but you know breaking into

620
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,600
a security to tell them they have

621
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,320
security flaws is still illegal

622
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,760
um and it's true and

623
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,240
but that is really denial denying the

624
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,600
victim

625
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,039
oh we weren't doing anything we were

626
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,120
helping them is sort of uh

627
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,760
flipping the whole thing on its head um

628
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,600
the appeal of the higher lordies loyalty

629
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,279
so there's operation sony

630
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,200
where you know there was this kid that

631
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,080
hacked his uh his playstation so he

632
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,840
could play older games on it

633
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,080
and what happened in that case sonny

634
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,919
filed a restraining order and told him

635
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:26,559
to stop

636
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,360
and they were going to prosecute him and

637
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,840
see him for millions of dollars

638
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,240
if he continued he was also the first

639
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,960
person that ever rooted iphone and they

640
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,720
asked steve jobs about it he's like

641
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,000
he's a hacker like i was um but in the

642
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,200
case of

643
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,279
sony they actually went after them

644
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,760
well so in this case the utterance is

645
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,200
when your friend asks you to do

646
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,960
something saying he needs you to help

647
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,559
and he offers

648
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,360
you you want to be as good as me this is

649
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,440
the right way to do it

650
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,320
your younger self is more than accepting

651
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,600
of these terms

652
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
the younger stupid self is happy to

653
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,360
oblige

654
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,880
um and the other

655
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,120
appeal to a lot higher authorities was

656
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,360
we lost sec actually

657
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,760
started because of one of the hacks and

658
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,080
it was a security company h.b gary

659
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,679
and they threatened to hack anonymous

660
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,360
and release information related to

661
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,640
anonymous members

662
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,520
and i got upset

663
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,039
so we found other neutralizations

664
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,279
one of the most interesting was a lady

665
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,960
that was interviewed

666
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,200
who basically is like she said i'm a

667
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,880
normal person i have a garden i'm a

668
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,400
person

669
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,679
um they pulled me

670
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,279
out and said we're looking for an

671
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,039
american propagandist i'm like you're in

672
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,080
kentucky

673
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,480
and i live on a farm and drink bud light

674
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,039
so these are all neutralizations

675
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,480
uh there's a point when you

676
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,520
you've passed a point of no return after

677
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,120
you're hacking for so long you reach

678
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,080
point of no return

679
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,159
regardless if you fear but they're going

680
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,279
to get you one day

681
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,559
it's too late i wouldn't use the term

682
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,120
joy

683
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,200
ride but i'd be lying if i said i wasn't

684
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,279
it wasn't exciting as a kid

685
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,039
you're with a computer and you think

686
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,720
it'd be really cool to be a super

687
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,399
hacker it was a

688
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,320
sort of like solving a puzzle or pro

689
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,520
problem solving you find that your

690
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,039
you complete the problem and you get a

691
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,159
sense of achievement

692
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,080
so these are other neutralizations or

693
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,200
reasons the people

694
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,240
did what they did there are limitations

695
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,520
to this study

696
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,640
we can't establish an etymology of

697
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,720
critical behavior

698
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,919
we can't establish causality cause

699
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:50,960
allergy

700
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,880
uh when then does the neutralization

701
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,240
occur

702
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,200
um and you know i argued and argued with

703
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,360
my co-authors about this the main author

704
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,200
is kimberly is kimberly

705
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,880
de cara bora who is a professor in

706
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,799
criminal justice criminology at marshall

707
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,360
university and then the co-author is a

708
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,640
is erica vogel clark who was kim's ga

709
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,760
and a very talented student uh but we

710
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,039
got the end of this i'm like i think we

711
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,880
found the new neutralization we found

712
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,000
these neutralizations

713
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,559
that did not fall in these categories

714
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,480
but based upon their rigor

715
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,120
of academic writing we you know they're

716
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,880
like you're taking a little bit too far

717
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,679
we need to do

718
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,039
more research um

719
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,760
so we did apply neutralization theory to

720
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,600
give it sort of a theoretical

721
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,720
framework so we could build on

722
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,880
the the work's already been done

723
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,559
especially in case of theory

724
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,640
we did use secondary research sources um

725
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,559
passages were extended were extracted

726
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,000
from the internet documentaries online

727
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,919
sources and magazines

728
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,279
continent uh commentary or speech from

729
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,720
each participant in operation

730
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,880
could could be found could not be found

731
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,200
so we did not always find a participant

732
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
that had spoken on the record about what

733
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,720
they did

734
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,679
so we have some conclusions we think

735
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,200
that most of these are

736
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,480
these fall into uh conduct condemnation

737
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,200
of the condemners

738
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,200
and appeal to higher world authority

739
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,880
possible crimes specific neutralizations

740
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,399
uh it also captures the ideality of

741
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,360
hacktivism

742
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,000
fighting for the common good uh where

743
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,880
the vehicles for

744
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,200
justice we need to better society to

745
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,039
help others

746
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,760
and they really most people saw these as

747
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,840
not a crime because they never thought

748
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,320
that

749
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,640
they never came up with the idea of you

750
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,840
know you

751
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,919
they never could fathom the idea that

752
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,399
what they were doing was illegal

753
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,559
i can't murder somebody with a computer

754
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,159
you know they just thought it was beyond

755
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,760
uh their their notion that you could

756
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,640
actually

757
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,840
actually commit a crime with the

758
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,600
computer but that's in the end what they

759
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,320
did

760
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,039
by doing these online protests uh by

761
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,279
launching denial service tax

762
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,279
um which is just downloading basically

763
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,720
a piece of software pointing a website

764
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,279
and hitting enter and that was their

765
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,399
only act

766
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,440
but yet people spent time in jail and on

767
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,080
probation

768
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,320
unable to touch a computer because of

769
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,919
their actions

770
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,360
so is there any questions
