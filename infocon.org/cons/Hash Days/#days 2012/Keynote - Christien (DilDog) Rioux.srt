1
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,059
so without further ado I would like to
introduce our keynote speaker for this

2
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:10,600
year

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,790
and actually really be the psych to have
him here because saddam

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,020
he arrived yesterday and the first thing
he did

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,669
is he came down to our NOC and start
attacking the batch

6
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:25,840
which I personally think is freaking
awesome

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,259
having s the most pimped out bats

8
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:33,489
up to this point apart from young was
spent some time before the concert so

9
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:39,170
really happy to have him so is the
cofounder and chief scientist wear coats

10
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,070
he used to work full of heavy industries

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,760
then at stake and later on Simon tech is
member of

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,530
called after that call and it's ninja
strike force and most of you guys

13
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,700
probably know him

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,370
ass one of the call to serve lost track
and the author of the original cold

15
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,890
of back orifice 2000 so these key for
you show on turf applause to Chris and

16
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,890
you

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,240
great okay so

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,250
I'm actually I could do an amazingly
technical talk this time I'm

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,899
last talk that again was a black cat was
about to static binary analysis

20
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:22,579
internals

21
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:27,560
was like two hours of intensive basic
block analysis type stuff in dataflow

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,649
analysis sir

23
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:32,459
um the stock sexual gonna be about my
experience

24
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,740
becoming management at a startup company
um

25
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,969
this is not something I necessarily
chose but found myself doing

26
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:42,640
um so your question

27
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,439
i'm for most you guys is probably what
happens I am

28
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,020
when hackers become management um

29
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,799
you know we have this image of what we
will be able to do

30
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,909
and what we can accomplish a.m. many
times and all telling others what to do

31
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:02,149
we're not would naturally very
independent

32
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:05,890
I'm so the question is you know what

33
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,660
what choices do we make and what we
study in what we learned

34
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,870
in order to be more effective in that
disappoint um

35
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,900
I started off fun my life in Maine out
as serve a backwards area the US some

36
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,660
really nothing else to do but system
programming went to MIT graduate in

37
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,739
computer science

38
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:28,120
and worked at a small incubated start-up
for a little while

39
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,690
it gave me an idea of exactly all the
wrong things to do

40
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,859
at a startup basically they were done in
the six months

41
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:41,019
blue-collar money spent on food um I
have

42
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:44,650
and I ended up going back to to MIT for

43
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,130
a you know more ideas

44
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,400
a a at around that time at the end of
the year

45
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,299
I want to lift heavy industries on on a
whim

46
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:59,530
freak my parents out yasser leaving this
bank job you're doing and you're going

47
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,620
to work with the budgetary hackers in a
in a

48
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,660
in a warehouse somewhere one over real
well with the family

49
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,310
um but I I thought we were onto
something

50
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,690
you know was passed to become like the
first programmer that they were gonna

51
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,410
pay

52
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,889
to do work there which is kinda like a

53
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:19,139
hackerspace those paying people to do
stuff is like a wild cat actually

54
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:22,389
if you actually make some money some
products we believe our day jobs

55
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:27,150
Ste you know which we had you know to
assume to handle so we would get fired

56
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,229
from a day jobs if we could just get rid
of the day job we could do the stuff all

57
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:31,209
time in that

58
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:34,259
was really attractive you know so on

59
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:38,720
we ended up kinda fulfilling on that
when we started at stake which was sorta

60
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,870
for the first

61
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,870
pure-play network in consulting security
consulting boutiques

62
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:50,739
um the Queen at at most at 150 people at
stake before we found that we were just

63
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:52,530
working ever want to death and they
would leave

64
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,639
I think maybe at that time

65
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:01,259
we were probably 500 qualified security
professionals in the world that could

66
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:01,829
have done

67
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:07,190
that work with that kind of a I'll level
utilization

68
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,940
weird making people work ninety-five
percent and you only got to be home

69
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,070
every once in a while

70
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,910
um I've very begrudgingly took a
contract to Microsoft to help out much

71
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,169
other stuff and a

72
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:21,509
you know that we're going to be using a
while but I'm you know I gotta

73
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:25,720
do some interesting work like I was on
the team that help secure IaaS

74
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,509
six and ASP dotnet which is pretty neat
work today by tellin

75
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:32,690
some the other people and get to know
these people and

76
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,180
didn't realize how useful that would be
until afterwards when at state broke

77
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:36,759
apart

78
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,639
in basically formed all of these other
little boutiques like everyone seems to

79
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,470
have like an ass taker floating around

80
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,400
in you know that they know on at stake
was acquired in 2004 by Symantec

81
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,580
a at which point the work that I was
doing was almost lost underneath the

82
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,710
the the rear end of a much larger
corporation

83
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,729
and wind up spinning out for our code

84
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:01,990
2005 I could tell you stories about

85
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,720
how we protect your IP in all this

86
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,900
so just skip over some other stuff here
but

87
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,810
to %uh I'm still writing of correctly or
not my spare time

88
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,030
there was going to be a lot of quick 7
and a you'll have an API with which you

89
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,000
can plug into it so

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,740
alright so this is what I look like a.m.

91
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,870
when I started I'm a programmer had no
publications in my motivation is

92
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,449
completely to just get a job in for
growers going on

93
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:33,610
arm plus five years and I have called
myself a hacker

94
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,509
um meant had polish a lot advisers lotta
tools

95
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:40,939
my motivation was to get into the media
as much as possible I think that was

96
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:43,150
sort of ac/dc thing still is

97
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,629
a.m. think that's pretty much our only
goal at this point um

98
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:51,169
10 years and I was 0 comments of a
security researcher

99
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:54,699
I was working at binary analysis
software and my motivation was really to

100
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:56,900
do something that people are claiming
was impossible

101
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,189
which was to reverse engineer binaries
and completely automated way

102
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:04,090
and produce available source code that
worked out pretty well

103
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,159
and i ended up your like poop stark

104
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:10,639
well work right I

105
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,439
same same person all the hair fell out
maybe had something to do with trying to

106
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,729
do something about Sabal but

107
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:19,819
if ended up bomb the chief innovation
officer a small start-up

108
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:23,509
I'm which is now becoming a big business
and I'm really happy with whoever cuts

109
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:24,099
going

110
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:27,449
um right now my publications it's pretty
much speaking engagements

111
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:32,550
I haven't had whole lotta time to do
anything other than code internally

112
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,529
so all these steps that I think

113
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,939
and I mail my life basically reinvent
itself every four years

114
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:44,050
yours does probably too you have some
decisions big decisions to think about

115
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,120
you make them

116
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,240
you may leave your job you may get
promoted you may

117
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,539
publish something that changes people's
perspective what you should be working

118
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:52,559
on

119
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:57,009
arm but basically the changes are not
necessarily just at a time

120
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:00,590
such as I'm getting older it's because
we made decisions along the way

121
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,969
so making good decisions is kinda key
getting perspective

122
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:07,439
what what has worked for others is
really important arm

123
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,550
but the question that I'm trying to
answer here is how we build a better

124
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,379
hacker security professional

125
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:16,050
how do you get on to be better to work

126
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,990
and be better management in the end
because its on almost inevitable

127
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,839
at some point that as you become more
experienced people look to you

128
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,219
to pass on that knowledge then some
point is going to be

129
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:32,339
a management on it for you so growth in
the security industry

130
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:36,449
please ignore my useless charts um

131
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:40,050
the security industry itself is very
important to understand

132
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,710
I'm because you're part of it and it is
moving very quickly

133
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,809
um I would still say that today there's
probably about five hundred qualified

134
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:50,719
security professionals in the world in
its linear growth or maybe there's

135
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:54,509
baby up to couple thousand now but
there's many more per to practitioners

136
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:55,360
that are

137
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,680
they're coming in its it is accelerating
at the beginning at say that

138
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,300
security might have actually been the
the second occupation

139
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,069
ever you can guess what the first one is
you'll understand why I think security

140
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:10,199
might have been the second

141
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,259
um I had

142
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,460
around since the sixties to the eighties
we had um

143
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,180
syrupy really people didn't really think
about security at all it was about

144
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,339
getting computers to work at all

145
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:25,770
and in 1998 um we had Morris worm which
I believe the

146
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,249
we actually maybe the the 28th or
something there

147
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:33,630
whatever it is 20 third I know at math
sucks but

148
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,479
and handmaiden they may have been done
today

149
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,729
finance taken anyway um

150
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,169
so at that point we we we got to a point
where we realize that this is going to

151
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:45,600
be more than just

152
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,029
set up a hobby for people that there was
actually

153
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,850
a security aspect computers you know we
had a decade of

154
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,540
building fire walls we had you know be
four years a figure out how to build

155
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,060
good

156
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,320
a good consultancies it's another five
years of

157
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,110
security architecture in you know it
inventing things like the SDLC

158
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,930
and a process for security and my
putting

159
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,120
process in place around something that
had been more than art form

160
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,760
and big data security application
security sir coming in as

161
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,170
we've gotten really good at the network
layer going up that stack

162
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,570
and offer ever gonna build us all the
social problem security

163
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,500
but it is a its own world we're well on
our way to getting to the point where

164
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,610
that's

165
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,899
may be the first point of entry these
days rather than just port scanning

166
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:37,970
so you see a lot of these I'm businesses
that we can end up working for

167
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,800
your experience may vary depending on
what track you're taking here

168
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,950
if you're in a consultancy there's
certain things going to be doing

169
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,370
for developing products security is
sometimes an afterthought more and more

170
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,230
companies are are putting it up front
now to soothe aching get away

171
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,500
um enterprises are a

172
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,550
have numerous different models for
incorporating security people

173
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,400
into what they do most notably you
notice the security department there's a

174
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,689
security on the IT team itself

175
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,450
and security key way and engineering on
security is being used like pepper still

176
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,860
I'm we are quite you know putting it on
everything and sprinkle it on but we're

177
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,630
not stay

178
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,470
necessarilly at the point yet where
security

179
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,770
I'm the see sows how long does the sea
so right now

180
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:29,000
maintains job on average well used to be
four years now said no I think it's too

181
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,320
you know we fail fast in this industry
that is one thing

182
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,250
we know so II you know until those jobs

183
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,460
started have some attention to them and
then

184
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,440
you know you can actually build careers
that are dead ends like that you know

185
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,270
you could come see so in the cycle
two-year should I knew better a major

186
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,330
money

187
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,620
um you know I if you're terminated
diseases can be really hard

188
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,070
to convince people that you know what
you're doing so you know

189
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,780
where's the career in that right I
suffers a service

190
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,200
you know we're basically you know Verica
right now my companies like subscription

191
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,980
for everything

192
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,820
on you know hopefully someday we'll be
able to makeup train platform on what we

193
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,580
do

194
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,800
so you know what happens to companies
over time sort of

195
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,080
there's a parallel between what happens
to people

196
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,300
over time there's a seed you know you
may get some money

197
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,020
startin' building ideas and then you
have a startup

198
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,540
where you put together a bunch of people
that you know you're kinda judge not on

199
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,750
the ideas but on the people themselves

200
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,330
and then a small company where you're
judged mostly on your execution in your

201
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,430
ability to

202
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,970
make good on their promises growth
period hopefully

203
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,340
at this point if you don't hit this
growth period is because you've got a

204
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,280
business

205
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,540
bytes the growth period is really about
um

206
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,130
making good and executing you know you
execute as much as you can

207
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,650
try not to run into cash and hopefully
reach some kind of maturity

208
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:54,570
if it's the and you plan for
congratulations if it is not

209
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,630
multi are many alternatives I what is
success

210
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:04,010
you know what happens at the end um need
usually you come into this with an exit

211
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,700
strategy come in thinking

212
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,700
you know what I really how long do we
want to be in this game

213
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,640
you know I wanna to security for five
years and i wanna

214
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,960
you know go live on a beach somewhere or
now perhaps your

215
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,160
you know well as people that actually
managed to both

216
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,210
but Sir rarely I find myself on

217
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,190
on the beach with sand my toes more more
so sitting at my desk trying to figure

218
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,600
out

219
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,340
you know another one a code for water
project working on

220
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,770
um but basically there's a few models
build quick

221
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,270
I tried to sell early long-haul

222
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,510
try to build a large company and then
there's the lifestyle company which is

223
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,180
this

224
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,060
void that letter companies end up in
because they didn't really think about

225
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,670
an exit strategy so that

226
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,020
you know may be there you know twenty
years out now

227
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,100
and they don't really have a plan you
not growing anymore

228
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,260
but you're also not looking you know
right for and future investment or

229
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,080
I A to point you have to do it only for
the for the love it to love the art or

230
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,630
whatever

231
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,880
but you know your company is not going
anywhere regardless

232
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,680
chances are lifestyle companies you into
transferring control when somebody dies

233
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,300
in the end a minute

234
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,890
peace you know agency knows no been
running a company for

235
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,840
thirty years and then the have to hand
it off to a young buck that wants to

236
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,440
become a CEO that kinda thing

237
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,270
self plan for that success factors a lot
of people talk about building such

238
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,490
shareholder value

239
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,390
and um having market leadership

240
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:39,960
you or all that comes in with her the
ideas maybe for doing something unique

241
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,210
and build it people will come I

242
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,340
but really many times it's about the
small tactical things

243
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,790
strategy and your timing om

244
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:54,940
stability and predictability is what you
gonna be judged on many times

245
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,960
if you can say I'm gonna do a certain
amount of

246
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,540
sales in the quarter and then actually
make good on that rather than missing or

247
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,910
hitting I mean you never really hit the
number

248
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,110
for the quarter you always been PLO
pastor you come short a little bit

249
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,720
but if you know that Delta can be shrunk
down

250
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,200
to the point where you are actually a
predictable entity

251
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,030
then you'll do really well in the market
people say on here

252
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,370
you know we know what to expect from
company X

253
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,770
you know you become a public company
that's all that's all

254
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,060
that's going to matter so what is a
success

255
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,280
for security professional we are all
motivated differently

256
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,680
enough for me it did you know we
actually use the lock pick set that for

257
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,940
code is part of our

258
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,050
are interviewing process but about the
table and say hey can I get to a glass a

259
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,900
water or something if I come back and
see messing with a lot pics I don't care

260
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,350
if you picked it or not

261
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,480
we have a different conversation you
know you not messing with it ollie

262
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,540
Union asked me about it during interview
then maybe you not the kinda person I

263
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,420
want working with

264
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:00,300
so what motivates you ask yourself why
are you doing this at all

265
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,290
you doing it for altruism made it
because you think it's a good thing for

266
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,740
the world to be working on security

267
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,380
money one deal to do this for your job
so you have to do something else

268
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,740
you want fame I mean I did at one point
I thought was cool to

269
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,140
you'll get up to for cameras a are you
bored I was bored in Maine that's kinda

270
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,390
got me started

271
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,660
many times where you know in it for ego
as well because hey you know

272
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,920
I could do something that nobody else
could do and that tracks people into a

273
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,440
whole lot of interesting psychological
stuff

274
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,550
you know do you like your job you have
to ask yourself that you know do you

275
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,350
wanna do security for time

276
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,870
are you doing it for time today you know
where you want to be in 15 years

277
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,270
I didn't really necessarily know but I
knew that

278
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:44,660
I want to be in master my own destiny in
that you know I want to go to control

279
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,680
what projects at work on and have
resources

280
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,410
and at the fight for that because
generally you're doing somebody else's

281
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:51,980
code

282
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,050
doing somebody else's work somebody
else's ideas you know

283
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,020
I wanted to do my own ideas I think that
independence really drove me to

284
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,360
making some other choices I've made now

285
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,040
summer some some cautions am becoming
famous sounds like a good idea

286
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,740
but once a famous turns out that it's
quite hard to turn that into money

287
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,760
everyone wants something free all the
time um

288
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,060
so you know it once you do have some
money I

289
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,660
then you don't want to know about it so
you try not to be famous right

290
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,750
so it turns out that these two things
are actually potentially to be famous

291
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,900
and rich not easiest thing to do in the
world you see you can hear about it

292
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,190
the celebrities and all that it's much
easier to be one or the other

293
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:38,070
but if you choose the path of going down
the road being famous for what you do

294
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:42,150
you either end up in jail or just not
making any money doing it

295
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,080
and spending over time with the media
trying to explain what you're doing and

296
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,060
all that

297
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,610
but necessarily making any money from it

298
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,690
on so what does success look like

299
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:56,170
um success is different for everybody
but we can all tend to agree that money

300
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,710
is not equal happiness

301
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:01,460
but my computer an enabler for future
success so it is a reasonable goal

302
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,079
to add to the list of things maybe
should be third from the top

303
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:08,360
um I tend to think that happiness can
bring about money I am

304
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,000
because you need to love what you are
doing if you're going to be successful

305
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,109
at it

306
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,360
I am your career requires that you love
what you're doing

307
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,559
so what is good enough is there a
perfect job

308
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,699
as our perfect role um basically

309
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:26,419
I think perfect is the mortal enemy of
good enough

310
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:29,770
and we'll get to that but you know

311
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,590
we do make choices so one of my choices
had to be about school

312
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,090
I wanted to go to MIT ever since I was 5
years old and red

313
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:41,330
see more peppers book on logo and move
the total around the screen

314
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,590
I i realize this is a place where stuff
got made

315
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,950
and was really entrance by lower I read
let marvin minsky is the eye stuff very

316
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,740
early on

317
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,210
and and uptake in a class with them
which was blew my mind but

318
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,919
arm the question is how much gold in it
you know I know more out-of-work PHD's

319
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,460
I'm with a relevant degree that simply
have priced themselves

320
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,890
out of country market you know you come
out at school with a PHD

321
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:12,330
and you know employers in a look at that
and say what we're paying a lot more it

322
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,750
doesn't have the real world experience
that we need

323
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,059
so when we just go somewhere with a
bachelor's degree

324
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:21,200
and as I look to then I was like well
when I was graduating was 1988 the

325
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,240
Internet bubble was just getting started
and was like well

326
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,760
when we just not go for master's degree
and get out as quickly as possible

327
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,809
truth is I never like school um I hacked
all the time rather than going to class

328
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:36,830
I got season things I shouldn't have and
one day I was

329
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,100
call then to my yeah advisor

330
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,170
and i th is a leak you she she told me
choose more the better could talk firsts

331
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:45,670
on

332
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:49,940
in the world and she told me that I had
no future in computer science

333
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,710
and I should pick another degree I'm

334
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,390
how to get a little disheartened by that
shit and I went back in I can't think

335
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,130
about my life

336
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,680
doing you know should be its gone class
Moran

337
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,940
she went on sabbatical for semester and
I ended up taking a compatriot trends in

338
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,220
computer science

339
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,440
syrup what's going on in the world class
um

340
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,230
and won the first assignments was to
study

341
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,360
a some publications about

342
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,620
and Internet Explorer buffer overflow

343
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,100
that I it published under my own handle

344
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,370
did that professor didn't realize that I
was in the class

345
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,280
and is that they were feeding my own
work back to me as coursework

346
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,160
so lucky for me I didn't have to do
homework because the calm work with me

347
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,090
I am I told the professor that blew my
mind but also gave me the fortitude to

348
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:44,870
continue

349
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,200
with computer security because I realize
that I was doing something relevant

350
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,750
and new um you know so I really can't
let people tell you

351
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,750
whether or not your decisions are good
ideas gonna go to get a little bit

352
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:01,320
on you know that said graduate no
chances are not Steve Jobs

353
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,620
or buckets you know they're plenty of
billionaires that worked all the way

354
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,460
through college got grease

355
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,500
so you know you may need that back up
Sunday

356
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,200
specifically for going to management you
might need business school it's possible

357
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,059
if you're going down the executive track
that you may want to learn those things

358
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:22,090
lot about finance in there knowing
whether decisions are good ones

359
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,500
based on their outcomes that you can
learn something from some

360
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,930
one thing that I have brought to
management seen a C %ah

361
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,080
the notion agriculture as a management

362
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,400
advantage you know basically

363
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,520
hackers come into the workforce in there
the skeptical we're all skeptical people

364
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,820
basically a healthy skepticism things
like proved to me that you've done some

365
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,860
work before

366
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,950
securing you know securing a machine
before I put it on the internet you get

367
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,280
on healthy skepticism

368
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,200
where basically we tear down all over
teammates no finding of their faults

369
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,510
you know everyone has faults in a pick
in a in this very easy to

370
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:03,040
to get to the point where we exploit our
team rather than

371
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,220
support them paranoia something that we
develop

372
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,840
because we realize that everyone is out
to get us um

373
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,890
you know we think healthy things like we
should conduct full security reviews the

374
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,970
software with each quarterly release an
automated reviews every minor release

375
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,980
that kind of thing

376
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,200
and unhealthy paranoia comes out many
times

377
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,460
like you know I think the sales
marketing team have it out for the

378
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,980
engineering team another

379
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,130
you know the contracting our efforts and
they want to put something up ugly and

380
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,710
stupid up on the web sites collect
looked under

381
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,830
you know that kinda thing very natural

382
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:38,050
for you know the hacker manager and
hacker and engineer

383
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,190
to experience and workplace we have
maker ethics

384
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,340
want to build things were independent um

385
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,760
and many times we spread that other
people it's infectious

386
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,660
and there's a lot I D a generation that
comes from the brainstorming that we

387
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,300
that we do in

388
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,890
in the workplace so you know in the in
the real world

389
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:00,150
um Google time is a good example of the
agriculture we got twenty percent of

390
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:00,750
employees

391
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,950
time being spent on on work projects but
many which which and a

392
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,970
perfect benefiting the company vere code
is

393
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,380
a the company that does regular
hackathons we do three-day stance would

394
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,780
stop doing all the work

395
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,460
for the company and go do whatever the
hell you want as long as its I inventing

396
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,650
something new

397
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,780
are playing with the new its new
learning a new thing and then you have

398
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,630
to talk about it

399
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,760
from the whole company explained what it
was you did sometimes it's going to

400
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,030
benefit the company sometimes this can
be like learning to knit

401
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,860
or something you know whatever it is you
have fun

402
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,809
to explain it show how you learned in
why you learned

403
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:37,460
um there are security awareness training
center happening people that never care

404
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,670
about security

405
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:42,860
are now participating in in corporate
events that actually teach them the

406
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,100
basics of like you know how not to get
fish in all it's a first for me what act

407
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,650
that social problem it is happening

408
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:54,179
um so yet I'll inmate misdemeanor was a
week we tend to be Cup condescending

409
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:57,670
toward the team in clueless masses which
sadly show them how did you fall

410
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,440
side scan me joking but

411
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,570
benefit survival tips I'm to our

412
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:08,660
I am a few things that you can take away
from the stock

413
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,470
rather than simply me bloviating in your
face about management

414
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,320
arm if think about role progression

415
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,130
I am you know you start off as an intern
individual contributor

416
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,809
I'm chances are you're good at what you
do or you inspire people lined up as a

417
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:24,990
Project Lead

418
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:29,600
that tends to you don't graduate from
that or being middle management at some

419
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,160
point

420
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,220
I'm Europe managing teams have teams

421
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,500
and you may end up in executive
management you know thinking about the

422
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,120
big picture

423
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,300
the company and things like that you at
that point you can end up dealing with

424
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,690
CEOs and board members and people who
have

425
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,309
farm you know less about connection to
the actual work

426
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:50,050
um and simply know that they want to get
their money back at some point

427
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:54,270
um the thing to watch out for is the
Peter Principle

428
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:58,440
known as the Peter Principle is a few
people get yeah it's it's basically the

429
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,570
people are going to be promoted to the
level of incompetence

430
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,610
um so at some point you have to ask
yourself you know

431
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,950
do I want to take the next step or Am I
you know hopefuls

432
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:13,460
hopelessly ya overconfident about what
I'm going to be able to do

433
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,790
you know I know plenty of good engineers
that have simply said I want to

434
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,630
be middle-management I don't want to be
anything more than that

435
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,840
I wanted continue to have my fingers in
what people are doing

436
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,050
in a red ink oh but I don't wanna become
an executive

437
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:32,770
because they might be too far away from
from the action

438
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:36,140
so we're gonna go into the ten
commandments hacker management have ten

439
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,910
things

440
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,990
that are absolutely important I feel

441
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:43,140
that have you know up to succeed here um

442
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,670
but we'll see if a sexy we've got a lot
lot lot lot lot of time left here but

443
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:50,250
them a number one actual appear
presentable

444
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:54,650
approachable and kind I'm all those are
different and important

445
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:59,090
appearance does matter um you know I've

446
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,390
at times you know issued to the notion
of love

447
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,980
showering include being clean and all of
that um

448
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:11,020
the datagrid the normals don't like it
very much

449
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:15,280
so and if you're going to to manage it's
best that

450
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,070
you at least make an effort to appear
presentable arm

451
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:23,290
kind this is important will be rewarded
if you can find it somewhere

452
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:29,010
it's good %uh there shall be a good team
leader and a good individual contributor

453
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,650
its tempting 1.1 becomes management to
use that as an excuse not to do any

454
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,660
individual contributions

455
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,790
you know just basically telling
everybody else what to do if you

456
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,660
delegate absolutely everything

457
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,230
you're not doing your job does you know
effectively

458
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,820
we manage you're on a team as well as

459
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,160
manage a team you know the team you're
on

460
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,559
I is really important um the team better
be the better than the sum of their

461
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,330
parts

462
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:58,510
others rise you are completely
irrelevant this process

463
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,200
you know if you're not making the team
better than a bunch of individuals

464
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,059
then you know doing anything useful the
mental capacity

465
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:11,200
that show prioritize the team you're on
rather than the teen you lead that might

466
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,160
be a little

467
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:18,020
com counter-intuitive but basically when
your manager the buck stops with you

468
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,400
for everything beneath you and for your
individual contributions

469
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,809
you can be passing something up you need
to be

470
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:29,090
passing up your individual contributions

471
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:32,290
before you pass up your team's
contributions you can always delegate

472
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,420
management

473
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,710
to the team itself or to the strongest
members of the team

474
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,880
if absolutely necessary but if you fail
in your own personal capacity

475
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,640
ever then the team you're on a project
you and you will no longer be allowed to

476
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,890
manage

477
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:49,640
as a management a sort of a privilege as
long as you don't stop

478
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,610
being valuable an individual capacity so
don't forget that

479
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:57,250
before thou shalt be inclusive many
skill sets an expertise in your

480
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,040
organization we tend to gravitate toward

481
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,210
hiring a players all the time

482
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,990
you know we want to be surrounded by
geniuses and intelligencia

483
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:12,140
this is while valuable I the way to run
a business you need

484
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:16,220
see players and be players around 22 on
otherwise

485
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,490
all the smart people will never want to
do the boring work

486
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:22,980
you know try to build a research
organization without some young people

487
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,570
and you'll find that all of the real the
intro level boring stuff never ever gets

488
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,000
done

489
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,650
and you people will see that group is
valueless so

490
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,790
you know higher a wide spectrum of
people wide spectrum the skill sets

491
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,360
expect

492
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,240
22 do knowledge transfer internally
promote internally

493
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,980
number five thou shalt embraced time
management techniques we love to take on

494
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,760
impossible projects that take an
infinite amount of time

495
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,440
you know we when nobody is this is
looking at our hacks

496
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,700
we doesn't matter how long it takes to
finish them I mean

497
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,190
in the working world you have
requirements

498
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,580
about when you're gonna get something
done and you're gonna make commitments

499
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,830
and people are gonna

500
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:05,640
make decisions based on your commitments
you know sales teams gonna go sell the

501
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,590
thing whether it's done being built or
not

502
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,780
see better not to you better not

503
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:15,110
a.m. make you bite off more than you can
troop buildup the better more than you

504
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,910
can chew in a reasonable time frame

505
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:20,510
I you not invincible in keeping your
team all together with tools will keep

506
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:20,970
discussed

507
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,120
realistic number six you should not
depend

508
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,700
on rock stars and hero coaters

509
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,970
I almost titled the stalking when done
this this one slide

510
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:36,080
I'm completely I was gonna Kansas
considering

511
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,010
few titles here one was the death of the
security Rockstar

512
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,910
it is important to note that security
knowledge is valuable

513
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:48,020
but that a single individual may or may
not

514
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,480
be a good team member valuable and the
me you know

515
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,890
the personality problems can you know
cause us to wonder why we hired somebody

516
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,600
who's so smart and just can't seem to

517
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,740
to make the team better um

518
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,770
the quote that they were graveyards for
indispensable man

519
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:08,330
plays in here you know so consider

520
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,490
what it would mean to you love your
resources behind like

521
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:15,220
you know a few geniuses and then not
have

522
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,540
you know a mechanism by which you could
swap them out at any one time

523
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,669
hero coaters that take on China projects

524
00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:27,330
are not not going to be on

525
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:31,679
scaleable people don't scale you know
you can just ask them to do more work

526
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,110
than their 40 hours it's not gonna
happen

527
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:39,150
or rather if they do it's going to be
for short bursts and you can rely on it

528
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:43,790
problem a shot embrace process you know
all these crazy things like Agile and

529
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,220
Scrum and all that other shit

530
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,700
get with Kanban learns some tools

531
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,179
get religion around process the best
decision I ever made a very close to

532
00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:54,410
make sure that we abstracted

533
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:58,400
each department and gave them a single
point of entry for communications

534
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,590
basically a one place for sale succumbed
engineering ask questions like can we

535
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,400
support this

536
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,960
or not um yet one place for engineering
to say

537
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,820
where should I send sales leads you know
I you know you have these kinds of

538
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,270
internal questions

539
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:15,450
the question is how do you I am

540
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:20,570
II you make it easy I want to come to
gets be above 200 people

541
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:24,940
it's like who'd you talk to you know you
need these sorta role-based

542
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,030
email addresses are ticketing system or
whatever in order to deal with it as

543
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,040
things grow

544
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,380
so consider single point of entry for
communications it's like an abstraction

545
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,080
barrier

546
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,880
make sure you don't silo everything off
you know when its tracks barrier with

547
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,559
no way to get in you know needle ivory
tower

548
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,200
thats impenetrable but you need clear
and defined interfaces

549
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,299
between different parts for company
number eight

550
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:51,100
their shots not require perfection for
is the mortal enemy of good enough so

551
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,880
that before

552
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,410
but raising the bar is water industry is
about you will never win

553
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:59,230
you'll never catch the bad guy if you do
it's almost useless

554
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:03,419
you know i i'd have been to so many
government

555
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:06,520
working group kinda things with
everybody sits around its like

556
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,120
Alcoholics Anonymous for people have
been hacked government you know oh yeah

557
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,960
I was actually

558
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,290
six months ago here's how it happened a
bar but

559
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:18,059
that underlying reason why they're there
still isn't I'm

560
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:21,390
they haven't gotten to the point where
they say all have got a problem you know

561
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,730
they're still saying I want to get the
bad guy you know supplanting somebody

562
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,960
else for security

563
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,280
so internally you know

564
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,720
you can't expect perfection from
anything

565
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,110
you know you have to find a line that's
good enough and

566
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:40,700
and be okay with good enough I am
recognize good enough when you see it

567
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,559
and and your projects I'm ship on time

568
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,549
you know ship real developer ship i
think is quite

569
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:51,750
number nine thou shalt trust but verify
I am

570
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,070
we 10 in security to become micro
managers

571
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,860
you know people who would that slice and
dice project up into tiny little pieces

572
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,210
and then

573
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,630
crawl a people's butts on a daily basis
to make sure they're doing at work

574
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,940
um that really is discouraging

575
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,940
you know every day having you know the
manager Charlotte yucatan yesterday okay

576
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,789
but gonna do today

577
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:14,320
okay you know I'm that kinda thing um

578
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,400
discourages the the natural creativity
that needs to happen

579
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,950
for people who enjoy their work um

580
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,789
so %ah review people's work to let them
do their job dammit

581
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:29,179
that's sort of a really important number
ninety nine or ten

582
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:33,370
at that shot give feedback well and take
feedback even better

583
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,950
just about all of Management is giving
feedback

584
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:40,049
I'll nope you where the shit sandwich

585
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:43,210
on her that term there's a bread

586
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:46,929
shit in the middle and not be so Brett
somebody comes in this this this is like

587
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:49,870
the number one management technique if
you know your schedule a business school

588
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:54,030
learned shit sandwich right you sit down
possibly injure office in

589
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:58,320
you want to look bad news what you do is
you compliment first to say hello

590
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,020
you know i were really impressed with
the progress on this project

591
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,059
but we need to talk about by the shit

592
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:08,660
right and after which you like but you
really coming along with

593
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,820
you know I think in six months we should
do another review and I i buy really

594
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,270
trusted you gonna be

595
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:17,100
you know this is dis issue will be
resolved then they go you know

596
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,410
after like two or three times that you
start to recognize the shit sandwich

597
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,539
when you see it

598
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:26,150
get management is more to it than the
shit sandwich so

599
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:31,660
to you know I'm recognize that giving
feedback you want to be direct

600
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,840
we're not Brett rarely do we have any
problem with being direct but

601
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,840
be kind to no one's going to take

602
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,820
feedback if it's not presented in a way
that doesn't feel threatening

603
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,070
you know so know your stuff you know
hackers

604
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:48,990
the people that you've hired two chances
are you have people like yourself

605
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,130
certain extent

606
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:53,289
hackers don't like criticism from people
that don't other stuff

607
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:57,220
now I find it way easier to go to an
engineer and talk and say we need to

608
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,690
rewrite this code because

609
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:01,740
you know nobody can read it infill take
it from me

610
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:06,809
you won't take it from some other
engineer that maybe doesn't know

611
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:10,349
you know a something steam wanna be
judge that kinda thing

612
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:14,210
those personalities and egos are hard
you'll be careful with those

613
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:17,990
so you know it's important to know your
stuff you can't lose

614
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:21,069
touch with the thing that got you

615
00:34:21,069 --> 00:34:24,190
to where you are you know you gotta keep
studying you gotta keep on top your game

616
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,079
otherwise I was gonna respected

617
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,980
your judgment calls so you know your
stuff in order to give feedback and be a

618
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,059
good hacker manager

619
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:37,409
you know a I think I think that's
basically it for my slights

620
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,819
2 minutes left so you know if there's
any questions

621
00:34:40,819 --> 00:34:43,899
I guess I could take a bite to you can
always buy me

622
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:47,349
at the bar here and I

623
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:50,470
a plea a plea I just make a plea let's
go back to something technical real

624
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:51,139
quick

625
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:55,250
someone in this room needs to right a
really good

626
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:59,250
SSDP spillover before they leave it's
that uses protocol in the world

627
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:02,839
completely on authenticated you can make
Windows boxes think that printers

628
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:06,839
networks Paxos whole other computers
filesystems

629
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:10,329
appear and disappear will on the network

630
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:14,329
it it's like UPnP but on crack in crazy
so

631
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:18,230
a there's no really good SSDP spoofer
that I know of

632
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:22,130
I would love to have one so if anyone
wants to write it and the great

633
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,090
right cheers guys enjoy hash test
