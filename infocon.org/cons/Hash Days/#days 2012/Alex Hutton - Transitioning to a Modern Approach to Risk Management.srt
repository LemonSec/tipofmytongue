1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,400
so what I wanted to talk

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,820
up is basically some experiences that
I've had in the past couple years

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,090
um and

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,930
them what I I'd like to to offer the
industry going forward

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,369
part of this presentation be a little
explanation

6
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,980
a tool that I've built for my risk group
%uh that you can use you can download an

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,330
abuse and so forth

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,590
arm so

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,879
so why should you listen to me um
there's not a lot a reason why

10
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:41,910
a I'll tell you what I have done and you
can judge whether or not I've done a

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,390
good job with my experience

12
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,149
first off and director of operational
risk for a US bank corporation

13
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,870
where the smallest have what's called
the too big to fail

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,820
so they have these banks in the US they
say these banks will let them die

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,070
if they screw up their capital
requirements these banks not so much

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,710
in with very smallest have those banks
um before that I worked for a company

17
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,970
called horizon

18
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,530
up there I was part of a team that did a
a report called a data breach

19
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,000
investigations report

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,970
on so help build that for a few years
before that worked for a penetration

21
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,060
testing company

22
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,410
basically doing all operations except
for the actual technical operations %uh

23
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,060
the test

24
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,360
I audio experience social engineer
experience

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,470
um but I honestly haven't thrown a
packet

26
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,849
in seven years just get that out of the
way

27
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:37,099
up for that %uh I worked as

28
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:43,380
a job see lol foreign product manager
for a firewall company in before that I

29
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,470
was the

30
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:49,920
Sales Engineer for an ISP you can you
tell their customers about these new

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,090
firewall things

32
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,399
and why they were important so i'd
explain the folks why

33
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:59,229
you they didn't need the static packet
filters on the routers they really need

34
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,950
some more security than that

35
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,440
tell far back so %uh

36
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,869
some level setting eyes like to do this
with my audiences user

37
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:11,180
core beliefs of mine they're they're
fairly unshakable first there's no

38
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:11,900
secure

39
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,630
your work for the penetration testing
company ever worked with

40
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,430
an organization you ever played with
stuff you know that that's

41
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,590
just not feasible um

42
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,629
risk is a hypothetical construct that
means you cannot reach out and touch it

43
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:29,390
is something that we imagine

44
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:34,200
in our heads we can try and put actual
units of measurement around it but

45
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,719
that's not always successful

46
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:39,170
and the third is that operational risk
does not equal financial risk we get

47
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,250
more now about later

48
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,790
so for today like to talk about why risk
management is broken

49
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,480
%uh changing to what I call the modern
approach

50
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,989
based on somebody else's work um in them
why

51
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:56,280
should we do that what does it mean to
be modern right are

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,680
and how we can go about doing that so
the big question

53
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,159
the big question is why do read most
risk management program socket

54
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,019
K um who here as a risk management
program

55
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,280
in the organization couple people
alright

56
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,519
anybody wanna tell me what the
difference between your risk program and

57
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:23,519
your audit program is

58
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,640
you can

59
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,990
will use different right my problem

60
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,780
with a with this is that I've got I'll

61
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,910
basically I've got an audit group that
talks about risk

62
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,070
and I've got a risk group that focuses
on the strength of controls

63
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:48,680
I've got all this redundancy in fact
KPMG's move your larger accounting firms

64
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,700
um they're talking about convergence

65
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,060
Rd Nov one large US love insurance
company

66
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,920
that is converging those the keep the
accountability structures

67
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,690
the different but in a sense the same
work

68
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,820
that's not sustainable right

69
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,950
so if you can tell me if their value
tourist national program

70
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,239
outside of being kind of prihodit no

71
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,840
that sucks cell the other problem I have

72
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,530
is um were dumb um

73
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,910
so you don't take my word for it um

74
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,540
this is Dan here and he's a really smart
guy much smarter than me

75
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,990
and he starts talking to us about how
are measurement skills these days

76
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,250
what they're mainly ordinal right

77
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,950
anybody know what up ordinal scale value
is in what you can and can't do that

78
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,110
k good we'll get into that

79
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:52,550
science is based on what's called a
ratio scale renewable skills you have

80
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,460
a celsius is an interval scale you have
this 0n you have

81
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,530
button you can say okay well one degree
plus

82
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,660
one degree minus is this skill thing

83
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,490
ratios skills are are bound it a
percentile for example

84
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,890
99th percentile 97 percentile 64 percent
%uh that's at least

85
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,720
ratios skills an example and Wornall
scare upscale is I like things

86
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,820
strawberry ice cream is a1 chocolate

87
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,890
is a true right we're not doing a good
job

88
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,640
if science is based on using not word
more but racial stuff

89
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,720
were crazy okay

90
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,419
here's an example of something that we
all probably use I'm not gonna call the

91
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:39,490
model by name

92
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,150
but it says the basic ways multiplies
impact by .6

93
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,660
and exploit ability by .4 okay

94
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,310
this is pretty much you can when you
think about it too saying jet engine

95
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:51,770
times

96
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,990
peanut butter equal shiny and I want you
to believe this

97
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,950
okay I don't care if you have Spock in
scotty

98
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:04,240
jordy indeed a Chewbacca in the good
doctor you can't break the fundamental

99
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,680
laws

100
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,419
how the universe works it doesn't work
that way the other badass thing about

101
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:09,970
this is

102
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,979
check this out impact by .6

103
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:16,560
points6 X would believe by .4

104
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,280
right what somebody's tried to do sure
is used us malls

105
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,970
to trick us into ratio skill thinking
decibels at Magic

106
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,419
writer not unicorn kurtz right just
adding one doesn't make it

107
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:32,940
a non-normal skill you have to think
about these things

108
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,430
K so this is Thomas Kuhn Thomas Kienzle
philosopher

109
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,960
a brown the history of science and in
what Thomas Kuhn

110
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,030
taught us is that there is a difference
between

111
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:49,610
pseudo-science and proto sites okay and
proto science you have

112
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,750
somewhat random fact gathering I call
this the metrics program

113
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,880
right not see we've got this many as
spam

114
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,890
messages we blocked you know anti-virus

115
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:06,110
triggered this many times harangue right
more awesome interesting trivial

116
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,210
relevant observations in a variety of
the response from what

117
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,340
he calls philosophical speculation I
call this is Sam's top 20

118
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,760
alright that doesn't mean those things
are

119
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,720
useful doesn't mean they don't have
meaning but

120
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,380
relieve the rigor behind those is not
what we would call scientific

121
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,890
so why are we in the state let's talk
about

122
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,539
risk so we probably have at least half a
dozen languages

123
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:39,270
are represented in the room if you go
into my English

124
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,630
a macintosh Apple dictionary you're
gonna find like six or seven different

125
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,450
definitions

126
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,610
Ste webster's in English will have 12

127
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,539
it's very interesting is the Japanese
this is %uh from the Seven Samurai

128
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,779
other Japanese hadn't until western
influence had no

129
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:59,820
word for risk

130
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,899
no one of two such cultures to have that
and the question I have for you is

131
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:09,050
is that this does this mean they didn't
have any rest right of course not

132
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:14,349
okay just meant they had to be very
specific about what they were looking at

133
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:18,149
okay and so i i win I have 17 risk
analyst

134
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:22,000
%uh and when I talk to the most you know
they're getting confused Assoc a

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,500
pretender Japanese

136
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,719
to use the word risk now talk to me

137
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:30,779
so we have in

138
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:35,450
western civilization three basic views
risk that I've encountered

139
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,839
the first as financial risk okay in
finance arrest has a positive and a

140
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,580
negative return

141
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,779
so you have a young football player he
comes out he's doing very well

142
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:49,710
well you here right he has some clear
path

143
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:54,220
as an investment for you he can either
be a superstar or he can be a Dutch take

144
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,070
your pick

145
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,320
right but but there you go

146
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,560
this is different from engineering
rescue right which we get from the Dutch

147
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,860
when they were building

148
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,220
um its origins from the Dutch from the
rebuilding the dikes

149
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,140
reclaiming the sea they want to see you
know how often the sea was can reclaim

150
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,220
up all of their land and what would

151
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,540
how bout without her and basically you
have a rate of decay

152
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,260
so you have that same young footballer
right

153
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,399
and he's operating at a hundred percent
and over the course

154
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,980
love the match he gets tired right maybe
it's injured

155
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:37,010
K so his he decays and if you think
about this right what we face

156
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,920
typically is partially engineering
problem not a financial risk problem

157
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,350
our fire was don't generally operate at
a hundred and ten hundred

158
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,640
20 percent a return just don't they're
not capable love it their system isn't

159
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,510
sport that um our audit driven approach
to risk management

160
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,459
let's build risk register and find where
all the risks our lives here

161
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:03,160
me explain what I mean engineering risk
management fines the weakness and

162
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,350
reinforces that

163
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,220
anybody ever do vulnerability assessment

164
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,240
I'd so

165
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,110
there's a bridge in Seattle goes across
the Puget Sound

166
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:20,260
the Tacoma Narrows Bridge and in 1940
the open this beautiful Bridgers much

167
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,070
people

168
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,200
all excited what they found was and

169
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,959
a gale the bridge starts of letting
anybody seen the video this on youtube

170
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,730
few people right very famous right and
of course

171
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,779
when steel in concrete oscillate
generally that

172
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:39,709
tends to happen not very pliable can

173
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:43,360
any you know they've rebuilt the bridge
now it's it's operating nicely

174
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,220
I'll but the risk in control
self-assessment that's what our CSA

175
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,209
stands for

176
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:52,850
the risk control self-assessment as we
come we perform it

177
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,899
has this inherent risk minus are
controls

178
00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:01,950
subtract all the controls um inherent
risk minus controls equals residual risk

179
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,140
anybody familiar with this question a
handful

180
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,870
yeah thats how awesome is your bridge

181
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:14,149
is what we're focused on here problem
with that of course

182
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:17,910
just had if you design a stupid bridge

183
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,940
right it doesn't matter how many girders
you had to use a left with the stupid

184
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,450
week bridge

185
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:27,570
and eventually that's gonna fail also

186
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,839
engineering is neat but when doesn't
have a motivation

187
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,339
right ones that like a long ago blow for
sure now

188
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:39,240
Morgan raindrops try to evade our
umbrella

189
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,399
okay so engineering is typically

190
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,640
very difficult to as the wrist
discipline to apply to

191
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,649
well we have which is an intelligent
motivated attacker

192
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:55,700
in fact there a lot of people who
believe we're dealing with is a complex

193
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,680
adaptive system

194
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,930
complex system anybody dabbled in
complexity

195
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,630
that right so complex systems basically

196
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,940
a system love combine parts whose

197
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,950
sum is greater than the whole you get
that right

198
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,500
yeah so you get these %uh you push on
the system in one place

199
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,870
and the way over here something
unintended happens

200
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,710
like to give you an example of that a
risk group that I know love

201
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,330
they gots assumed by a large company a
large company had

202
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,750
strong passwords on these devices right
so

203
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,920
not only did you have to have

204
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,130
um numbers letters they had

205
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,560
there had to be a dove them yet to have
a special character even

206
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,730
right he's been all this time during an
end and what the risk group

207
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,060
well they they were used to a smaller
password they're kinda

208
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,800
take da so they did somewhat analysis
and what they realized was

209
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,450
this is great you're more likely to kill
an employee in a car accident

210
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:00,690
trying to unlock their phones and have a
data breach based on a two simple

211
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,980
character password

212
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,070
would he think audited think they listen
to the snow

213
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:13,160
strong passwords right there all

214
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,590
so ya this complex system problem

215
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,910
this is doctor Richard cook talk to cook
built are a little book

216
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,030
based on his observations a

217
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,930
a hospital about failures in complex
systems

218
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,800
when these are some interesting up

219
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,360
excerpts from that book and wanted you
take a look at some movies

220
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,990
right the complexity the systems makes
it impossible

221
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,730
for them to run without multiple flaws
being present again

222
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,010
who's got a vulnerability management
program right

223
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:52,270
other individually in enough
insufficient to cause data

224
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,120
right shows change constantly because
I've changing technology

225
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,740
work organization and efforts to
replicate those failures

226
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:07,360
K these are more excerpts insurer I've
changed failure to rest

227
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,370
and it starts smelling like okay this is

228
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,960
problem space that I live in

229
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,340
and so if you take this our CSA

230
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,950
and you worry about um and her mother's
controls

231
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,170
it was residual Wichard loomis we doing
here

232
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,190
is establishing a point probability know
you may be doing it

233
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,930
extremely poor sleep qualitatively

234
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,720
maybe you're doing a better job maybe or
foreigners often do you do in

235
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,230
quantitative risk

236
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,490
but the problem with that is there a lot
of people who are smarter than

237
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,920
we are who say you can't do that

238
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,180
Ryan so condescending Frederick II aka
thinks we're adorable

239
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,590
alright in the deal is what they will
say is you have to look for patterns in

240
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,430
the system

241
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:59,380
cell anybody wanna tell me what this is

242
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,400
flights over the united states right
yeah and you can see the pattern of the

243
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,100
United States as it emerges

244
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,710
so there's a third piece I'd like to
talk about which I called medical risk

245
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:13,850
I works in criminology to various other
disciplines reply familiar with but I'll

246
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,090
give you the background

247
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,240
a doctor john snow 'em

248
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,890
is called the father of modern
epidemiology and what he decided was

249
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,790
cholera

250
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,010
wasn't because apps bad wind

251
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,720
which was the prevailing thought at the
time there was a an outbreak of cholera

252
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,880
in London

253
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,460
and what he did and this if you've read
tough these book you recognize this

254
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,170
isn't of these book

255
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:40,029
a what he did is he charted deaths from
cholera

256
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:43,700
against love X's which our pops

257
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,390
for water where people go into the water
and sure enough

258
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,840
in Broad Street that pump right there
have been built %uh

259
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:56,460
two meters from he recently
decommissioned suspect

260
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:02,160
go so as about the epidemiology or this
medical approaches

261
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,320
involved you get a handful love risk

262
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,980
thoughts here that are relatively useful
arm

263
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,230
for them and I think they could be
useful for us if least

264
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,160
stop thinking about engineering rest for
a bit

265
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,720
um and they are in fact in a complex
system like a city of London

266
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,510
their you the means to find patterns

267
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,730
okay now not all correlations causation

268
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,500
and so on and so forth right but at
least you have

269
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,040
aid evidence-based understanding what's
going on

270
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,000
so designed to find those

271
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,160
why does this management socket well
because we're focused on how awesome is

272
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,200
your bridge

273
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:51,270
not how much you associated with failure
even or how good is your lifestyle

274
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:57,450
serious question can you imagine if your
doctor operated the same way you did

275
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:02,190
right should be like this poor kid over
here

276
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,250
I'm the other thing to note is that his
mom and she

277
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,520
yeah they're not exactly svelter than a
poll americans

278
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,760
um half their lifestyle isn't that great
so maybe if this kid would start beating

279
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,610
twinkies and ho-hos

280
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,799
right and and maybe a few vegetables we
wouldn't have to be in the gym up either

281
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,120
he be faster

282
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,189
stronger et cetera okay

283
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:29,240
so I'll we're not doing a great job in
risk management

284
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,799
this time we were we were upfront and
honest with ourselves

285
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,640
about our approach in what it means

286
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,960
what I'd like to do is talk about change
came

287
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,190
and from change I mean let's focus on

288
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,150
how much was to be have why do we have
that risk

289
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,039
and stop worrying about gobs and gobs
and gobs of risk things risks in the

290
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,390
register

291
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:57,010
right about the inspiration here

292
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:01,010
comes from this up the link is there but
that's cited actuaries

293
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,340
basically the sink to a lot of

294
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,380
this traditional approach to risk
management

295
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,330
are going back to the financial crisis
I'll years back

296
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:15,210
right here's why it happened based on
this risk management principles

297
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:20,409
here's what you should do instead K
about the second piece that's chain cam

298
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:23,380
I you might know him from a company
called tripwire but what he's also done

299
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,700
in his spare time

300
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,799
is the IT process Institute move put a
lot of helpful books called visible

301
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,049
ops office box for security basically
says availability incidents

302
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:39,270
our correlates water that is how awesome
your people your processes are

303
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:43,150
ripe so how many of your audits actually
audit 4

304
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:50,150
experience qualifications

305
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,690
next one this is what I got to work on
that's doctor too but he's both a

306
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,600
medical doctor in a PhD

307
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,510
in a pilot um and basically the data
breach report

308
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,700
I i worked on that's an epidemiological
approach

309
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,909
to examining of failures

310
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:10,480
data breaches right so the modern
approach risk management

311
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,520
we have a quick three-part manifesto to
this

312
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,210
up based on that stuff first up

313
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,360
risk management must provide value must
address the need

314
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,090
and it must be a fickle first clause to
be ethical

315
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:29,809
we have to become data scientists and
Biostatistics Ryan Gosling

316
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:33,460
suggests that may be looking to base
their I'm a bit

317
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,820
%uh that's a little stats joke for folks
are

318
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,330
but it's actually fairly easy what Ryan
house to understand

319
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:44,029
you have three essential sets of
information %uh this is a

320
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:48,039
a basic diagrammed on taken as gospel or
anything it breaks your in there if you

321
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:48,610
push on

322
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,370
but you have the threat landscape
information about your threat

323
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:56,520
information by your assets information
about your impacts information about

324
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,390
trolls

325
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:01,240
where the SATs overlap you have the
ability to model Indian knowledge

326
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,980
and where they all Climate Center you
have risk you do not have risk if you

327
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,419
don't have all of them

328
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:11,559
in Equation okay may have something
kantouris but is not risk

329
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:15,210
not impact you cannot be talking about
rest well controls you're talking about

330
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,159
this crazy

331
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,149
inherent risk thing which doesn't really
exist actually but that's a different

332
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:24,640
talk well within this what we've done is
we've taken

333
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,860
this concept you need a framework that
describes reality

334
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,840
data about that reality models help you
gain wisdom

335
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,000
so basically you have this holistic view

336
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,270
write your framework should describe
everything in that set

337
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:47,780
the data that you collect ride is going
to be about this individual parts in the

338
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,230
models is the synthesis of knowledge

339
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,490
there's a feedback loop rare there
cracked

340
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,210
K so where I work we quickly figure out
to him for things

341
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:02,100
first we have to be data-driven most
studied the individual parts

342
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,300
%uh then the relationships between those
parts

343
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,170
and then only then can we release our
thinking about the whole

344
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:14,230
the third so what we're using is what I
use called Verisign varices publicly

345
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,760
available

346
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,960
under a Creative Commons license various
as the framework

347
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,360
okay a Ferris

348
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,240
has is not deterring approach talks
about and agent

349
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,640
cell internal/external partner agents in
those have meta-data under her committed

350
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,030
associated with them

351
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,059
Asian action rights to your error

352
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:40,230
you are packing which is actual

353
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,220
I'll different from our because hacking
involves a

354
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,600
an actual touch or a decent script

355
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,770
now we're which is offer itself misuse

356
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:56,120
where you can somebody privileges and
they're abusing those

357
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,350
social physical environmental you also
attributes so

358
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,400
a and assets so you have an asset like

359
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,910
web server an opportune house not really
confidentiality integrity and

360
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,960
availability

361
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,480
so when agent axe ugg axe

362
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,500
action against San asset causing an

363
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,030
attribute to be compromised that makes
sense

364
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:24,570
right and so this is a really big
ontology we built

365
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:29,929
for the fries and data breach that I'm
no applying where I work

366
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:33,710
the third thing we figured out as we're
looking at a boatload of data

367
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,900
k so how big of a boatload

368
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,010
well this is %uh this is really cool
this is

369
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:44,250
I wish I had built the side in on but I
liken this to you

370
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:49,040
our version of that tough to do diagram
across the top you have the actions in

371
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,440
the agents

372
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,260
right and a across this access you have
the assets

373
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:58,630
and the attributes the servers networks
use devices now are hacking so forth

374
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,970
right and then out of all the secret
service judge had

375
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,550
high tech crime unit and Verizon data
sure the frequencies

376
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:10,090
with which those failures show

377
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:13,220
how big is a boatload well this is

378
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:18,050
just high-level varices millions of
square suffice or

379
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:22,110
applying it to operational risk I need
to add more squares

380
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:26,890
millions million square as hell because
a boatload its big

381
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,690
are pretty quickly figured out I'm a new
picture book me see jaws

382
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:34,860
point where the the fish swims by slick

383
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,309
yeah that's it that's all of I liked
when I realize

384
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:43,150
so the good news is the organization I
joined had a security data warehouse

385
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:47,799
already with a hundred twenty plus
terabytes of information

386
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:52,010
and it a year ago where we're now much
more than that

387
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,290
and we can look at this warehouse when
the context the ferris

388
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:59,120
extended for operation all of
Operational Risk

389
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,220
use the data warehouse in order to
actually

390
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:08,440
do evidence-based approach so how do we
deal with a boatload well we use Hadoop

391
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:14,150
okay we also have arm a Postgres we have
we have a lot of technologies

392
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,530
but the core information is in Hadoop

393
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:22,679
and so %uh desserts affair leave
fundamental data warehousing diagram

394
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,190
but here again we have our are two
colors around the data and where we're

395
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:29,790
getting it from a MapReduce process

396
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:35,140
a hive um and/or drill a fat ever gets a
little more Ste

397
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,320
awesome and then I can pull that out

398
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,150
my GRC platform is not archer my jersey
platform is not metricStream GRC

399
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,440
platform

400
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,220
is do I have are

401
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,640
pipe fun Excel

402
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,230
right we have much more meaning out of
that and we would have spending millions

403
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,299
of dollars

404
00:24:56,299 --> 00:25:01,320
on a GRC box how do we do with a bullet
in this is conceptually we're just

405
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,470
taking finding

406
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,570
these bits of data in the wild dropping
in there

407
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:09,559
and then I can make sense out about my
analyst group can

408
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:13,140
K and this is a diagram that we built

409
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,780
for on-boarding offender we on board
offender

410
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,780
we stop collecting hundreds of controls

411
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,720
we threw away that craziness anybody
about 41 others nonsense is out

412
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,740
you know lied to me 250 time so I can on
board as a vendor

413
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,980
couple people he outspent but um I saw

414
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,070
I decided I'd start making people lie to
me and so weak like to but a handful

415
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:39,910
information about them we throw that in
with that happens is that becomes a

416
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,970
piece of intelligence

417
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:46,570
so what we've done is we've tried to
deconstruct things almost a genomic

418
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,460
approach

419
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:52,780
and what we do where her dupe allows us
to store all of these pieces

420
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,400
love you know organizations genome if
you want to keep it that way

421
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,630
%uh back to intelligence close to this
is really important to me given my

422
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,850
background

423
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:07,150
look risk management useful so if it
doesn't spark under threat operations

424
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:14,150
what's most important thing a street
department does

425
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:19,460
stop bad guys and it's it's relatively
easy so we have a counter threat

426
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,470
operations

427
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:25,150
as skelly group half proactive forensics
after first pen testing

428
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,970
okay and what we started doing is

429
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:33,610
is for example you can track any peace a
data through this analytical process

430
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,130
that we've instigated

431
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:39,080
okay we realize pretty quickly that risk
management is just an intelligence

432
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,320
function

433
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,350
and yeah that was a big :love: da

434
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,750
for us but what we allowed us to do is
say

435
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,970
well we have types of intelligence and
we have our role

436
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,299
in this the information types that are
really applicable in the tools that we

437
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:55,940
use

438
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,420
so real time supports color throughout
operations

439
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:03,640
all rules relatively low there we give
people part so the roadmap

440
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:09,340
part we actually do call map love
process not like MapReduce person like

441
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:09,590
an

442
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,929
Atlas what's going on and then when new
thread Intel comes in from counter

443
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:15,169
threat ops

444
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:18,280
love from FSIS actor Roadhouse or
whatever

445
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,130
well what we're able to do is then say
oh lol

446
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:27,230
they focus on the stuff we don't meddle
into so need for the bureaucracy

447
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:31,270
main information that we're giving them
is basically some asset

448
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:35,620
information and then they have controls
they use they have her do

449
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,630
%uh streaming verses you can use storm
kafka

450
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,850
I've never used but that's a another
string processing

451
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:47,510
peace your hive Journal drill for
searching and so forth

452
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:51,410
attack to call security operations right
up

453
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,490
we work with them on we're giving them

454
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:59,940
information about state so yet any
access management final rules group

455
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,690
you know all these other operational
pieces that are

456
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,900
specifically counter threat ops we work
with them

457
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,980
and again they use much the same stuff
%uh

458
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,500
strategic Intel we push up the food
chain

459
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,650
actually I have of 14c years I report to
14 risk management

460
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:21,530
group because we're Bancorp so I
actually posted up a whole lot

461
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:25,429
love through the strategic angle

462
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:28,910
right any questions on our

463
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:32,640
10 so that's how we approach said what's
important here to notice also that

464
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,660
that you need feedback loops counter
threat ups news talk to me

465
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:41,200
I need to talk to them you know I need
to be able to still what's going on in

466
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,169
kind of write ups

467
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:45,980
up the food chain she's P so what I do
is just

468
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:50,320
put it in the business speak for folks
um

469
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,720
but basically the feedback loop is an
important piece of this

470
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,520
if you don't have that as he crafted a
new form of operations based on data

471
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,590
it is going to be difficult because
you're not really testing and

472
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,190
revalidation hypotheses

473
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:09,000
alright so I was listening to a CISO
talk

474
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,470
and he was over major American
corporations he said

475
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:17,220
which inch you know the future is going
to be are

476
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,490
basically deeper arise assets in the
cloud

477
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,190
and there's no trust that the in-state

478
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:27,740
okay that's fine for all your stuff Nick
filed in

479
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,049
don't trust any of it sounds good my
assertion is this

480
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:35,080
if you if you build out a real data
warehouse

481
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,710
if you hire a handful those Ryan
Gosling's we have three

482
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,169
a modelers sweet I call them the sweet
sweet basins

483
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:46,510
and fraud I have to modelers myself if
you start doing that

484
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:51,740
um actually primer controls be
behavioral analytics

485
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,980
on me and some machine learning and

486
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,220
some languages to do that in you know

487
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,780
up so some examples up

488
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,059
so we do put everything in select eat
our systems

489
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:08,580
for example you connect or network I'll

490
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,650
we capture your Mac address: and then we
watch everything you do

491
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:17,350
right um so we can watch in real time

492
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,760
by your Mac Address linked your cost
center

493
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,880
what systems are you touching we know
the process

494
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,530
right the process map for wire transfer

495
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,910
that's the finding stored in Hadoop

496
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:34,320
why you touching something else

497
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,110
right so that that's interesting
information the time of connection so

498
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:44,070
a hooking your badge system in right
stream from the bad system

499
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:47,770
and a stream from our proxy well that's
weird

500
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:51,410
home why either party connections
happening from the skies dust-up when

501
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,690
he's not in the building

502
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:57,890
you know um %uh riskiest costs under
this is my favorite

503
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,059
so you get to go to somebody for some
buddies boss even better SME's bosses

504
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:03,110
boss he said

505
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:07,120
here cost center right let's look at all
the assets you have

506
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,320
let's look at what your employees are
doing was good how much

507
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,500
but what value provided to the
organization

508
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,720
your cost center is in the top 10
percent I'll

509
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,600
risky costner's can can we work on this
together

510
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,919
right because nobody wants to be great
against their peers

511
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,230
onerous by risk basis

512
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:31,210
right my for claus is this um

513
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,179
you have to support russian
decision-making summer fly through a

514
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:35,330
couple these we use

515
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:39,030
affair for scenario analysis if you're
from there was a factor in all some

516
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,299
information risk

517
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:44,280
be simply network for scenario analysis
and you something that I'm calling for

518
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:44,789
ago

519
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:48,299
because I'm I'm really creative um for
state analysis

520
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:53,370
knots basically verus inspired risk
rating for operational risk

521
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:58,429
so how much was to have how well my
living

522
00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:03,770
and but this is a example love affair
now since we did

523
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:08,120
sanitized had the values changed but
basically

524
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,700
your analyst are giving relatively
subjective inputs into the basin belief

525
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,620
network

526
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,890
army and you come out with you rinse
Monte Carlo simulations

527
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:22,130
and you come out with a actual risk
value that has units with it

528
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:25,900
frequency and dollar time and money

529
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:30,890
small businesses really care about case
that's kinda fun and interesting

530
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:34,660
um Monte Carlo simulations for those who
aren't familiar

531
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:38,169
%uh basically you run you

532
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:42,210
you take these various distributions you
compare them against each other

533
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,690
you do a lot of times and this is what
happened so you have

534
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:49,250
these are unfortunately I don't like
this visualization method because

535
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,730
logarithmic

536
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:56,260
but you can say oh well it's pretty
obvious year that

537
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,530
once every 10 years we're looking at
risk

538
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:02,580
somewhere between low you know
half-a-million

539
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:07,620
million will over that's our greatest
concentration

540
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,910
a of scenarios what we do instead

541
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:15,840
is we match the simulation results to
qualitative

542
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,570
labels that are assigned to quantitative
skills agreed this out

543
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:24,710
further for it and so what we're able to
use were able to say well this is

544
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,620
moderate risk because not all the of our
bank corporation's doing qualitative

545
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,789
analysis

546
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:32,860
this is moderate risk well why well
because

547
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,950
the impact out a three thousand
simulations wasn't

548
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:39,020
nada likelihood however own

549
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,669
swelter we likely for you and so that
but

550
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:46,110
you know in these are are skiller vote
so

551
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:49,410
that's actually kinda meaningful for
executives who

552
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:54,270
have no idea what we're doing but they
know big red circles are bad

553
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,600
purses small greens

554
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,650
virga scorecard this is a mind map um

555
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,890
I couldn't give you an actual scorecard
example my apologies

556
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:07,630
but I was allowed to give you a kind of
the mind map that use development

557
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:10,809
um ignore the compliance peace yes I
have that

558
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:13,859
we all know what compliances um

559
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:17,089
but what we do is worry we are actually
able to say he work

560
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:20,399
your business unit your you're only help

561
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:25,270
who business you you know hip is our
health care law on US

562
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:28,829
you're only hipper a relevant business
unit

563
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:32,030
CF risk elements their risk factors

564
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:35,839
iris determinants of your medical risk
terminology

565
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,980
these other folks on have not scan for
red light

566
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:43,119
um but we take all of this information
in this this actually goes out several

567
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,909
levels

568
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:49,270
where we map it into the information you
take it in how we did it in

569
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:53,470
alright so I promise you at all we don't
I'm

570
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:58,299
good okay so I promise you a tool um

571
00:34:58,299 --> 00:35:01,569
and I call the risk fish

572
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:05,520
um so the problem space can be really
confusing to talk about I remember once

573
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,730
we did a a

574
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,760
as I was doing a conference it was the
first time I ran into a chief risk

575
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,510
operate our chief risk

576
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,030
officer as one of the largest credit
unions

577
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,109
in the United States

578
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:23,990
and we had the CISO the CRO the CF move
the CEO

579
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:28,039
all kinda on the call right and the pen
tester saying you know

580
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:33,670
found this issue right and so the CIS I
guess that's a threat

581
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,730
right and and the siege the CF focus

582
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:41,990
you know that that's a vulnerability
ride and 0 cuz that's a risk

583
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,329
great you know and and you can get very
frustrated

584
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:48,569
with the semantic games believe me

585
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:52,319
um the other thing is people

586
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:56,140
national grab it or Tate towards fixing
that some them

587
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:00,410
right it's much easier to Pat gonna buy
a laugh and throw down than to try and

588
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,079
talk to developers not be in

589
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,660
jackals um you know and and coding
poorly

590
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:11,500
right so a a.m. because we tend to

591
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,990
tryin reinforce those girders rather
than root cause

592
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:18,390
I tried to do something a little
different so this is our

593
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:21,680
not gonna try the first name is a kallah
um

594
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,680
and he'd built a quality circles

595
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,039
if you're familiar with Toyota quality
management um

596
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:32,460
and he built a fish diagram for
manufacturing

597
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:37,089
so you have these measurements materials
personnel

598
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:41,180
no idea here is you take this worksheet
into you quality circle

599
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,670
basically everybody in Reno in stock but
problem the issue

600
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,720
this threat vulnerability risk thing
right

601
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,380
and he said well we've got this defect
why did it happen

602
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:56,480
her all the sub elements K and so what
I've done

603
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,359
as I actually taking this very first
thing that we use that for rising

604
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:04,030
um extended a little bit from my views
um

605
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:07,609
I've made it for risk management

606
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:10,500
so you remember those those circles I
showed you in there and their

607
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,770
interconnections and so forth

608
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:15,819
right um if you know

609
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:19,420
%uh and and it's easily reference upon
worksheet on difference you the

610
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,650
worksheet

611
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:24,829
if you know the lower level diagrams you
can walk through this worksheet with

612
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:25,170
your

613
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:28,960
with an analyst a security person
executive whomever

614
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,160
you've got some risk issue well what are
the agents we care about

615
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,359
let's have a conversation the most
likely region and the most likely

616
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,380
actions

617
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,499
right motivation what motivates them

618
00:37:42,499 --> 00:37:46,729
right so if this is the cyber fighters a
arkansas odd

619
00:37:46,729 --> 00:37:51,339
um what's going to motivate them is is
an availability utility attack against

620
00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:52,130
me

621
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,900
that's gonna cost some money they're
gonna do it hacking denial of service

622
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,549
and we can get

623
00:37:56,549 --> 00:38:00,009
more specifics on the ground service
stuff which I'm told I can do

624
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:03,609
you know everybody knows it um against
assets Ryan

625
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:06,229
the assets that the that the
intelligence tells us that typically

626
00:38:06,229 --> 00:38:06,849
doing

627
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:10,579
or controls um know we've identified

628
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:15,339
here that'll help us with that so we can
quickly go through that worksheet

629
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:20,099
you know this offer developer who is
doing it really craptastic job

630
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:23,380
rights even internal agent um we have

631
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,359
error as an action the asset is your
software

632
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,400
the attributes about called integrity

633
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,119
um depends on how bad they could be all
sex right

634
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:37,359
%uh the controls you have and i cant
talk about the controls this

635
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,049
sum up this is self-evident my guys on
always felt a worksheet every time I

636
00:38:41,049 --> 00:38:43,619
talk to each other with every
conversation

637
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:46,700
but if you get into a position where
somebody says

638
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,390
what do we do about this why do we why
are we doing this

639
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:54,489
if you have are creating a deal
warehousing you want to put stuff into

640
00:38:54,489 --> 00:38:55,559
it

641
00:38:55,559 --> 00:39:00,559
that has meaning this is essentially a
tax system

642
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,950
are there shouldn't be a tag missing so
if you want to download this it's

643
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,029
available

644
00:39:06,029 --> 00:39:09,180
both at the Society for information risk
analyst site

645
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,799
um and you can go the various
communities I think their stuff there

646
00:39:12,799 --> 00:39:13,819
too

647
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:17,479
%uh without giving the XML schema for
various

648
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:22,529
which can use yourself this is available
under Creative Commons license

649
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:26,109
and its freely available for download

650
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:29,739
so I'm not close like the Daily Show for
those who sing that

651
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:33,259
your moment of Zen which is this know we
talked about

652
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:36,390
Japanese having no word for risk

653
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:39,799
and and how I encourage my analysts to
not use

654
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:43,049
word risk when you're talking to the
business

655
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:46,119
because it facilitates out

656
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:50,009
honest to goodness the moment you can't
go like an entire month

657
00:39:50,009 --> 00:39:53,839
and never use the word risk to describe
anything

658
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,839
you don't use the word risk as a crutch
that's the point you know

659
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,420
but you doing a decent job risk analysis

660
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,880
can I would encourage all of you guys
right when you're talking

661
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,309
to folks stop using would risk

662
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:13,440
tell them what they're talking about
were brisk especially for English

663
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,349
speakers

664
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:17,589
is a crutch

665
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:23,549
so um there's a really good chance that
risk management will be redundant

666
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:26,559
if risk management becomes somewhat
redundant

667
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:31,549
verses audit we're gonna lose a lot of
stuff in the things that we will lose

668
00:40:31,549 --> 00:40:36,329
basically is the ability to help each
other in terms of intelligence

669
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:39,489
okay in terms of communication

670
00:40:39,489 --> 00:40:43,109
and in terms of trying to go away from

671
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:46,619
and audit driven were standards driven
approach

672
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:50,579
and pretending like be coming I so 27001
certified

673
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:55,849
has any sort of bearing on whether or
not you're secure

674
00:40:55,849 --> 00:41:00,160
that's my %ah as my presentation thank
you

675
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,680
I'll be glad to take questions

676
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,009
just

677
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:14,390
it you mentioned it is you have a
methodology in which have

678
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:17,640
did on one side and you play mottos i
was just wondering

679
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,660
how do you assess the quality of of a
model

680
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:27,660
and party could of how do you determine
baseline to compare it with

681
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,989
great

682
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:40,299
read 5 checking in um so

683
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:45,430
are a data quality model quality are two
different things

684
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:50,749
okay data quality you actually need
audit art it's got a great role I'm not

685
00:41:50,749 --> 00:41:51,650
trying to get rid of

686
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:55,729
I'm just telling risk management lookout
in this don't don't get me wrong

687
00:41:55,729 --> 00:42:01,569
um data quality a is is something that
you have to mind

688
00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:05,690
false positives are problem no matter
what in that

689
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,999
fortunately quarter leading things
becomes easier

690
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:14,400
so as an example false-positive and
vulnerability scan this looks like it's

691
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,499
an Oracle database

692
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:19,739
yeah it's not really because we know
that that mac Address with scienter

693
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:23,109
you know this as/400 over here the
doesn't run anything and we can pick up

694
00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:24,660
a phone call some reasons

695
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:28,680
work on the yes for underwrite now okay
good

696
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,599
Crees for the marzo for for the deer
quality

697
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:36,769
you can that's relatively simple for
model quality that's harder

698
00:42:36,769 --> 00:42:41,619
case all models nothing but a hypothesis
you mean a model in the sense of a

699
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:45,960
predictive model right cracked cracked
mass predictive about the future or the

700
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,170
past with the present

701
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:50,200
as well what people don't realize that
but when you have a huge amount of

702
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,410
uncertainty

703
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:54,589
and landscapes that you're dealing with
you actually have

704
00:42:54,589 --> 00:42:59,069
you have to be protective about the path
from in about what's currently going on

705
00:42:59,069 --> 00:43:02,739
so um for your modeling

706
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:07,339
you really need to in investigate I

707
00:43:07,339 --> 00:43:11,469
this is why I'm so keen on use a base
their own

708
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:16,779
right model selection right model
updating

709
00:43:16,779 --> 00:43:20,109
you troops establishing the rational
model itself

710
00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:24,609
value at risk is known to be a broken
model for financial risk

711
00:43:24,609 --> 00:43:28,979
and yet most US organization still use
far

712
00:43:28,979 --> 00:43:32,019
as a means right why well

713
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:36,069
means for what wives because the the
regulators really arts

714
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:39,170
prior idea what they are smart enough at
a higher level

715
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:42,339
but nobody's forcing them to

716
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:45,559
right nobody's saying well as try it
because that's hard work

717
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:50,559
arm for fraud analytics the models has
to constantly update

718
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:53,749
right the signatures have to be made
relevant for the latest

719
00:43:53,749 --> 00:43:58,200
variances Seuss or whatever arm so that
model updating

720
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,839
%ah in quality in our organization
happens very very rapidly

721
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:06,229
based on this Intel a tactical piece on

722
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:09,329
used like civil matrix

723
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:14,559
was about 100 the number of for spicy
the number or something

724
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:17,799
and using these different metrics you
say okay model

725
00:44:17,799 --> 00:44:21,049
a better than mine be to yeah

726
00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:24,059
for right account takeovers right

727
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:28,249
now you have I cut out for the sake of
brevity my data

728
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:31,259
quality slides my actually

729
00:44:31,259 --> 00:44:35,390
borrowed from the UK's evidence-based

730
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:38,890
medicine approach %uh so

731
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:42,989
some if you're familiar with that occurs
from is the top evidence that the

732
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:46,940
I dearie I forget which one is as the
worst evidence

733
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:50,749
you know he is is basically shamans you
know

734
00:44:50,749 --> 00:44:53,749
applying leechers crazy stuff are

735
00:44:53,749 --> 00:44:57,609
the problem is you're dealing in C's and
D's many times knots again where

736
00:44:57,609 --> 00:45:01,329
stochastic or inference based stuff can
can help

737
00:45:01,329 --> 00:45:05,390
outside easy many times you just too
busy to really do

738
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:09,719
even a good job unfortunately but at
least you doing better than

739
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:16,719
you had before thank you sure

740
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:20,680
No

741
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,920
alright so %ah

742
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,660
a wanna thank you all very much

743
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:30,829
I'm sorry for talk too fast but I had a
lot of lies I wanted to go through

744
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:34,890
a and with all our go have a beer
