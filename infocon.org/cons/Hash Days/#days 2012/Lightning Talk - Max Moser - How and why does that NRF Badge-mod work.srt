1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,210
okay I

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:07,630
Sallisaw

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,740
ask how dispatch modification actually
works and I really think that the

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,080
concept behind a bit

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,250
a is is really underestimated by most
secure to people's even Travis Goodspeed

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,680
did the great sauk

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,360
read it its packet in packets and this
amazing talk and basically we use that

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,800
technique to

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,279
identify I N not accept a conductor base
communication devices

10
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:34,530
um just as a side note that's used for
example in

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,490
a by the ski boats and stories one
secret a device identify which is so 5

12
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,340
bytes in the case of keyboards and if
you know that and the channel you can

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,330
communicate

14
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,540
weights the device without anything else
just by using the same chip

15
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,540
when configuring it properly now I just
set that

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,750
you need about five fights for the
device a

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,450
bytes and that's my slide and basically

18
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,670
what their radial pattern looks like
normally into analog were to start at

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,299
like something and then you have
something like a swing in petaluma and

20
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,299
and 800

21
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:13,759
modulation takes place individual who
worked both

22
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:17,819
reported that basically keeping first
the signal at a certain states

23
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:21,359
and then they don't expect the same
thing

24
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,819
it's just high low high low whatever or
the other way around so low high low

25
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:26,700
high low

26
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,020
so if you're look at our pad on

27
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,020
that's basically always AA of Ife
ile-ife

28
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,189
so a packet usually starts always

29
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:39,649
weights 55 OAAA

30
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:43,249
in hex and Dan adding data

31
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:46,329
whatever now that ship base

32
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:50,060
configure its to actually detect
automatically

33
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,259
packets that are using those device
addresses

34
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:57,350
which are usually in here Fife bytes

35
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,469
so even if to chip is crappy

36
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:05,259
and cheap it's easy to feel too I was
five fights

37
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:10,149
out of the whole high-speed to make up
its compare communication on low-cost

38
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:10,780
radio

39
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,569
but it's really hot if you want to do
that for example for just one bite or

40
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,390
two but because there is a lot of noise

41
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:22,030
going on out there butts on not accept
conductor did something

42
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,460
maybe on purpose maybe so on a row there
is an illegal setting

43
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,530
which were also discovered by Travis
actually

44
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,960
during your discussions about a war

45
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,260
kick ricki I'm and Keyport

46
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,910
sniffle stuff he actually tried to

47
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,120
set state legal settings within the
manual

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,750
thats a.m. it specifies that you can
choose a though

49
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,590
3405 party vice addresses and there is
one setting which is illegal

50
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,970
and this actually allows you to set

51
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,710
two bites as a device address now

52
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:03,060
the oldest trick in the world this well
if we try to find a pet form

53
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,540
right in before that one we might be
able to

54
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,300
gets the whole packet not only but it's
in here

55
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:16,020
because to chip is actually detecting
the device address

56
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,020
and as a developer you too only get
access to the data to the real date on

57
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,490
here

58
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,920
so by tricking now the chip
configuration into

59
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,030
well just look for two bites and I would
like to look for

60
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:34,990
00 Fife Fife please look for packets
with that device address

61
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,840
actually this works this is no book but
it's illegal

62
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,370
from the documentation but what happens
is

63
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,650
I the chip gets a lot of noise

64
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,680
I mean there are a lot of pet them in
there in the hold communication which

65
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,020
seems like a very packets but the cool
thing is

66
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,000
that's chip actually actually does the
whole demonization stuff 'em

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,069
everything and you get all the rest of
the information

68
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:04,120
as it would be data but

69
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,050
in their custody at the real device
address and remember

70
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:13,430
that's one of the secrets and the
channel so what we did actually is just

71
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,989
configuring at the existing chip too
much

72
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:20,560
and look for that petrol and then

73
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,380
took to rest the state so take a look at
its

74
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,960
find some pet on which look reasonable
comparing multiple times and you

75
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,770
immediately find some devices out there

76
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,840
a which look reasonable in fact

77
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,000
at least five spice lengths because
there are 55 device addresses

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,560
and that's exactly what the device to us
it looks for patterns

79
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,330
if it finds its at the certain show it
the %uh the city this place

80
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,960
the device address and the channel
number and you can take

81
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,160
that information it just reconfigure it
to that settings and you can

82
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,389
communicate then on the protocol level
and not on the

83
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:03,930
Raju level anymore so there is no need
for sniffer anymore because

84
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,490
you got only takes two communicates

85
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,630
that said you clear it to the Vice so

86
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,790
that was it but it wasn't what code
actually is doing

87
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,960
that's possibly the cheapest way to get
up to speed with

88
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,419
Nordic semiconductor or sniffing

89
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:25,169
and your curve a side effect is to roll

90
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:29,180
packets will be time to the serial port
as well on the picture so

91
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,770
with a send you later on the the cold
and it will be published maybe you

92
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,290
aren't

93
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,130
everyone can do that to modules are
available from spoke from for a few

94
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,290
dollars

95
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,290
and then you can at least analyze

96
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,940
term not accept a conductor based
communication up to 2

97
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,840
megabits and I mean died years not from

98
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,700
from for myself so Travis actually is so

99
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,080
having trading for identifying that
thing

100
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,650
and I really

101
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,220
suggest that you reaches rest of the
paper packaging packets

102
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,190
because that same technique allows you

103
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,820
at the same technique can be applied
also to date so in the Sun at Framestore

104
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,290
whatever because if you manage to

105
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:24,000
to basically do something like

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,750
0055 into this case

107
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,310
and you own payloads

108
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,370
in a valid frame which is

109
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,940
not sure because the chip adds that
again you know

110
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,889
and device address then it's pretty
obvious that you actually can inject

111
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:48,070
in nearly every radio communication
system which is the really old

112
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,550
I can has been done the multiple types
told they've

113
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,150
the only %uh thing you have to take care
of that you

114
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,419
invalidate the first part of the package
by jamming

115
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:01,570
by sending too many bites by just

116
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,639
overflowing the child whatever and the
chip

117
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,160
bill automatically I thinks that's not a
valid packet

118
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,880
starts continue listening on the radio
and we'll identify

119
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,419
immediately and you stop it and thats
actually

120
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:20,760
your packet and their that the paper
goes

121
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,820
far beyond what I just told because a

122
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,110
its also possible to cross me to.

123
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,440
boundaries by sending packets inside
some

124
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,460
I don't know is in that frame spot
targeting a specific radio communication

125
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,540
so it's not even focused on a specific
media

126
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,880
but it's basically the same trick and I
guess it's rather simple so far 12

127
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,090
just look at Nordic semiconductor based
story test

128
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:49,340
thank you
