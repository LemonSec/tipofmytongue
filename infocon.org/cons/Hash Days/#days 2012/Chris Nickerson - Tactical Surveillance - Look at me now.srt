58
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:29,749
this is cool right so I just have to
express how much I love it

59
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:34,819
okay sources about so I II and also the
weird part 04

60
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:39,049
side get cited and have some closure my
life and give

61
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:42,549
some talks about fun things that I
really like to do

62
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:46,900
that I always just going to get show on
something because

63
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,069
as easy as it may be to get

64
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,299
sequel maybe easy to get

65
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,379
some random box that you know everyone
has 0806 events

66
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:00,049
out somewhere and some machine they just
couldn't you know a patch for whatever

67
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:01,790
reason is but

68
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,349
how love people like I love them so much
that I really like get all abilities

69
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:06,969
stuff

70
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:10,999
I like looking at their stuff I look at
the stuff other peoples that they look

71
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:11,359
there

72
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:14,409
a look at the stuff that they look at
that they don't want people aka I love

73
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:14,699
it

74
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,910
Lake is really fun to see the things
that someone

75
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,860
interacts with behind a closed door when
they think nobody's watching you'll do

76
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,750
weird shit

77
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,400
I know I do weird shit you to be super
weird stuff as well

78
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,479
and I'm not just saying that cuz I don't
know

79
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,900
I'm sayin its we're and when people do
weird stuff you find out a lot of cool

80
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,680
things about them

81
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,479
like but their passwords are because
they do really really weird something

82
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,770
like no one's gonna know

83
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,470
my password is this the furry 7 in a
home-like

84
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,699
I am the big up get it it

85
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,069
so alright we'll talk about surveilling
people

86
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:54,750
right in corporate surveillance and and
I want to start this kind at a high

87
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,300
level

88
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,009
I because it's easier and because you
guys may need to do this and get to

89
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:03,000
you know probably after this first piece
to really scare the shit out of some

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,349
executives before they're like

91
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:07,840
yes so you're not allowed to use the
internet again

92
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,819
and however wanna see your graphs and
maps just get the out

93
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:15,629
but also pay you because I know you go
of stuff so what do you do when you look

94
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:16,250
at corporate

95
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,810
companies right you want to break them
down

96
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,169
right boiling the ocean is really hard
to do when I say I wanna do

97
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:24,319
intelligence-gathering

98
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,580
on XY and suspect

99
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,919
it's gonna take a lot I mean there's a
lot of stuff out there

100
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:35,310
like I I'm not gonna be utopian industry
logo checkers are right I prince was

101
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,720
buried went there now have all the names
now I know everybody's stuff

102
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,919
know you just know they're stupid like
the name you know anything about

103
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,110
so wanna go break it down to employees
were partners they have

104
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,389
competitors adversaries that they have
adversaries really good to know

105
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:53,680
by the way because before you start
surveillance

106
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,840
this is like the you're not supposed to
tell people so

107
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,590
do this surveillance on their
adversaries

108
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,620
figure out how the adversaries work and
then when you're doing your surveillance

109
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,530
pic is ever catch you

110
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,240
think them knaves Cal leave you alone
the black bear

111
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,639
damn them our competitors will get them
and then you start the corporate

112
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,780
intelligence weren't feeling both in pay

113
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,770
condom on I'm not saying if you do that

114
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,569
it's cheap a home but you want to get
stuff rights we gotta start thinking

115
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:31,669
about what what we get Hadley break this
down into little groups

116
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:34,780
and have we monitor piece a little group
we find things that are fun

117
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,099
and we find that are fun because we're
all a TD in some way shape or form

118
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:42,159
we go all shiny any play with a shiny
thing to get more than up shiny in

119
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,150
another category

120
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,590
ages drop shiny atop your little buckets
and the other they have a whole bunch

121
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,370
because we need stuff legal

122
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:53,969
call what my own you look your bucket so
whatever looks funny good things

123
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:57,139
that this is this is the you know big
boys and soldiers gather

124
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:01,520
of so I do you find stuff right hoover's
is great for businesses that give you

125
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,830
all sorts of stuff like you know what
the person made the year before

126
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,259
are you know like the people who made

127
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:12,349
salary cuz you know they're so the vice
chairman is just such a good guy only

128
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:16,539
takes for their salary but he also had a
seventy thousand about us

129
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:19,749
know it's that's cool are

130
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:23,009
a wide you can see also to make stuff

131
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,439
we start mapping out the business see
how this is operates but also give you

132
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,120
all sorts of

133
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,740
meet fun once you get to a point
attacking people cuz you're gonna know

134
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,900
the company

135
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,039
you be able to name drop all sorts of
stuff

136
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:37,169
I mean hell if you getting to the point
I love

137
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:41,080
James roars financials I'm sure there's
something shady and some that he is but

138
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,110
somewhere

139
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,310
where you be like look James I know you
mean one point

140
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,490
you know 169 231 million dollars last
year but

141
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,620
the night that you spend forty seven
thousand dollars at Secrets

142
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,169
it's not a secret but so we have to talk
about how

143
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:04,349
it becomes the stays a secret okay

144
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:07,889
now I'm kind of a visual person so I
like market visual

145
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:11,039
which is really good they also do some
interesting analytics around

146
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,449
how people work together on the market
arm

147
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:20,860
seriously I i have lost hundreds of days
of my life to the stupid grafton I love

148
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,069
exactly comida

149
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:26,789
combos up in something else or why are
they connected the ponies click click

150
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:29,289
click click in the Internet has sucked
me in

151
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:33,210
but try and stay on track it's very hard
and one thing I do you like about that

152
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,789
as you can get mappings all the entities
export them

153
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:38,729
I'm so then what are the tools we talk
about later you can start in Philly

154
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:39,070
dated

155
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,260
that I mock

156
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,529
marks really awesome I'm good I'm lucky
that com

157
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:48,630
it's another really interesting business
and House website

158
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,830
again I'm telling you all these states
only do the same thing

159
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,290
they are different because they have
different data sources up

160
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,640
recently on Tony

161
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,000
arm recently I was doing some fun Intel
stuff in there wasn't enough

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,120
about a particular company so

163
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,000
I filed some issuance grievances with
the Better Business Bureau about like me

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,310
not being able to do my due diligence

165
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,280
to get the information you needed about
who they were partnered with and how

166
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,200
their business operates all that stuff

167
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,810
so third Better Business Bureau went in
there like okay well we need to get your

168
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,730
records and all they certainly spend no
back to records were

169
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:32,140
out-of-date thank you for bring us up to
us we've refresh the database

170
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,760
like whatever

171
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,890
where do I find the Refresh Cup oh well
there's this other site

172
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,060
that if you use that we actually have a
tie to called

173
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,210
Corp wiki arm which I think I have
around here somewhere

174
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,550
Corp we keep all state data so what I do
I type in a person's name the next day

175
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,750
all the sudden magically the frog art
char appears all this stuff

176
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,280
now pitted the person did a really good
job at

177
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,580
making their intelligence private
because they paid some people of two

178
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,400
you know forget them in the Refresh but
all you have to do is ask the government

179
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,610
authority to refresh that because it's
their job to protect you and it's your

180
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,620
job to do due diligence

181
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,240
you know the information just falls from
the sky sometimes

182
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,840
um lil sis is awesome because lil sis is
actually

183
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,150
Ron with centralize pieces of data

184
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,300
and then the user community inside a
full-service

185
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,010
starts to attach things to it so what
you start to see that everybody who's

186
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,680
pissed at that company ever

187
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,020
starts dropping docks and better to this

188
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,970
because they want people to be like
they're a bad company and you have all

189
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,570
the pita people all the Intel people
that they paid to Khaleej information

190
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,290
still databases and shit like that

191
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,440
just dump it in Lincoln on here its
awesome

192
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,210
and they do it you know I'm just
anonymously helping the world oh you're

193
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,810
purposely screwing someone but I need
the information so I don't care

194
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,000
hit alright Lake then

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,790
have whatever point kidder's arm jigsaws
awesome

196
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,600
you values jigsaw before

197
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,120
aged it's just a huge vicious sales
database

198
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,150
love your name your tight all your email
address your mail stop your phone number

199
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,620
so that the sales people can be like 0
they just got a budget for firewall in

200
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,100
your firewall company pay me 5 grand
I'll give you their phone number and

201
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,900
tell you whether you need to buy
something

202
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,690
they're horrible in your team better
about it is that

203
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,670
Salesforce bottom so now they have
everybody's phone number

204
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,700
and their sales force is doing although
the resource planning everything else so

205
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,350
they know when the new budget comes in
there like ok or other spam these people

206
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,050
who are spammers that's a firewall

207
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:43,200
have all call I don't think it's a
coincidence that these people who happen

208
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,400
to call you when you need it

209
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,800
hey it its cool

210
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,390
like uses that mean how awesome is that
you get to be like you know I'm a fire

211
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,170
offender I know your budget

212
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,930
why its cuz just I I'm I get much done
with it like I

213
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,700
I'm here for you to protect you buy
stuff

214
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:09,700
it I idk usually it's a it's an older
microsoft project still does really well

215
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,680
way that they built it they actually
built it so that you can automate

216
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,800
the creation of somebody's bio by
publicly available sources

217
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,680
think how cool that would be if you want
to watch someone

218
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,360
show me all the stuff click yea at

219
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,620
so once we've started to whittle down
the people that leak too much

220
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,780
intelligence

221
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,820
right those are obviously the ones we
have to go over cuz we don't want to

222
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,410
challenge ourselves we just want to do
the easy things get paid

223
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,670
at are so we gotta look at those people

224
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,920
she look at some other things than the
people right who they are

225
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,440
what they do why they do that stuff

226
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,690
how it's pretty simple

227
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:52,770
yeah you know inside those you have the
WHO and you can find out stuff about

228
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,630
them or talk about who in

229
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,810
and you know who are they so these are
all

230
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,750
again super automated way is to find out
who someone is

231
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,570
you can go to blame checker you could go
to one of those places and you could

232
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,670
take an email address

233
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,400
and partial against 400-plus different
sites

234
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,450
and find out where they also have
accounts even those accounts don't have

235
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,520
the awesome

236
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,350
security settings the Facebook Hosur
baby they do

237
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,210
offer you know maybe there are the
somehow site that doesn't protect

238
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:27,210
anything about their profile and runs
phpBB that hit single injection

239
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,470
you just happened to go over by accident
are

240
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,930
and why they doing that like what what
what are they doing once they

241
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,650
exist in this internet love hours

242
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,550
is out there arm and ways to find out
the people

243
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,270
like what they're doing and how they're
doing it there's social networks right

244
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:50,000
that's the whole purpose of social
network is you make some identity and

245
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,670
then you tell people I poop dinner like
your your bootable

246
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,270
do it we're totally the same in lower
different countries are like yeah it's

247
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:56,800
awesome

248
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,060
like you get out here from

249
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,520
so be aware of looking at their media
landscape

250
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,790
where they talk the most widely talked
the most their

251
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,740
I these things are really important if
you're trying to bag tag somebody

252
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,910
you know if if I'm actively watching in
the day her the day that I wanna go

253
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,340
after the target cider I wanna go plant
bugs in the house and things like that

254
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,410
I need to have heads up display all the
places that they talkin who they are

255
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,370
running real time so that when they're
like oh I forgot my key gotta go back

256
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:31,140
home that sucks hahaha I'm like yes it
does

257
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,330
ok you know hope

258
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,750
clean up my shit I

259
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,620
so you right I've already talked about

260
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,270
10 terabytes information on someone
right that you're trying to parse err

261
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,580
CF to come get down to little bit
knowing them this is where

262
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,090
in the subject you wanna actually become
the subject to rate you spend your law

263
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:00,210
you know chill out load Jessup you like

264
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,960
and Jeff Bridges white Tron shit you
just sit there in like

265
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,900
meditate figure out how can you
manipulate this person

266
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,550
who they are right I need to go into who
they are

267
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:15,050
I know that they went to the school
here's my perceptions about people

268
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:19,210
the school in what happened I do there
in this fraternity and i know that

269
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,320
I'm similar to them in these in these in
these ways so I can start to come to get

270
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,040
into that character I know that their
this race I know that there's this

271
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,490
religion and I know that

272
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,070
you know they believe in their religion
this with this much this is how their

273
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,960
parents operate this is how they are
this other sisters are

274
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,010
here's the candid nature their
conversation between this person versus

275
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,600
the professional nature here

276
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,200
can I have the professional conversation
going to have a candid conversation

277
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,710
right you get into that because what
that's going to do is it's gonna start

278
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,250
to see you have a see the world

279
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,250
and by looking at how they see the world
which is the most accurate picture the

280
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:55,210
world of course because it's theirs

281
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:59,150
you're gonna start being able to figure
out where they drop things that you did

282
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,560
you have on your first search

283
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,350
right you're gonna know that if they use
religious passwords

284
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,810
a bank give them that are most likely
you're gonna know that

285
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,950
if they have superstitions about
something

286
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,570
if all you have to do is you know steel

287
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:21,110
a black cat out of alleyway and throw
that will bastard industry

288
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,050
in order for them to turn their car
around and go another direction because

289
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,970
they're afraid to cross the road

290
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,320
you get to really control that person
and when they're of their game they're

291
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,530
not doing what they would normally do
they screw up

292
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,880
when they screw up we went

293
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,220
yeah arm

294
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:44,210
you know how far you from Kevin Bacon

295
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,500
you wanna find people's connections
Google will tell you

296
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,830
if I can type in your name and bacon
number it'll tell you how many

297
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,110
connections that you have

298
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,620
until you get to Kevin Bacon now it
doesn't tell me between me and my target

299
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,130
but something to think about how does
that play a

300
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,789
K everybody wants to see this

301
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:07,740
everybody wants to know this every
social network in the world wants to

302
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,929
know how close you are to somebody else

303
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:13,169
because the closer they can get you
together the more value they're

304
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:16,679
providing you and the more likely you
are to like given money or toys R

305
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,000
credits or corns or

306
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,280
forget artichokes or whatever the hell
they make money on

307
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,770
that mapping the relationships

308
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,490
now we have an idea of who they are we
have an idea

309
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,880
love what they're doing where they're
doing it

310
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,750
who they do it with because may be there

311
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,470
like some hardy go to security companies

316
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,750

317
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,640
like we're standing firm on abilities on
the network

as its the community's excellent work

325
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:35,140
um Salesforce aP's use any those

326
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:41,530
that you people so Salesforce has some
really cool thing right have or chart

327
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,070
is do you guys is that some if you
really got the entire or char

328
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,690
organizations are finding you tell
somebody

329
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,630
Illini like

330
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,710
so the order you like click the company
could or charter

331
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,850
but like me to torture for you that
Google

332
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,110
I inside you is also really need shows
you whose at what position and what

333
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,470
levels in which one of them are willing
to answer questions on things like glass

334
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,160
door and

335
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,440
and other web sites like that arm square
Rio is sales intelligence

336
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,680
so if you can find out the types of
things that you are trying

337
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,530
to look after like like the keywords
that you're searching for

338
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:26,240
for Twitter that's going to make sure it
hits your feed to know that you wanted

339
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,680
to

340
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,780
do with something their company writer
make sure that

341
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,380
if you were pissed about something that
they would see it of I know what's going

342
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,110
to make

343
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,500
positive that you will click on
something

344
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,900
to see what it's about went I've got
your right they only have

345
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,820
I close my eyes and shoot a bargain I
know it's gonna hate you

346
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,830
is built for you

347
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:53,170
touch graph any such craft before
showing different types of weighted

348
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,730
relationships by folding in

349
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,860
networks touch grip supports Facebook I

350
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,390
and its kinda half ass supports like
they're not really

351
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,660
but it does um and that it actually
makes

352
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,930
collusion circles to say these people
are very close to each other

353
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,210
these people are close to each other
these people are close to each other

354
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,510
and my amalgamation of my own is the

355
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,940
you know horrible incestuous security
community and light some

356
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,400
other people I know pic credit

357
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,710
up Facebook's really fun

358
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,280
to do that with because they have
security controls on the security

359
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,320
controls stupid

360
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,600
up have you ever typed someone's name

361
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,250
a question mark and Eagles and somebody
else's name

362
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,510
yeah you know those it brings up a page

363
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:46,480
completely dedicated how this person
knows this first

364
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,950
that's hot like that's so

365
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,559
like order awesome haha

366
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,660
I have to know how you know this person
no problem just like being

367
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:03,270
and call look it like really even told
you like when they became friends

368
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,860
has Dexter thank you for securing live

369
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,120
book face I'm

370
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:15,200
alright lead it has a lead naps to they
make there's always being cool looking

371
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,210
I'm again it auto populates when you
have bigger circles

372
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,410
your information security colleagues in
303 so

373
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,690
again here's why devoted it was like
life is like a random

374
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:30,260
a hot spring yeah I think some people
from a job I use the word

375
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,500
I but see how these things it as you get
more visuals on these maps

376
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,550
you start to see some really really
interesting stuff

377
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:42,040
I'm some things that you're looking for
right is your you're looking for

378
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,070
collusion points you looking for who
would be easy target looking for

379
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,100
somebody's outside your target list but

380
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,230
connected to your target they are
looking apt

381
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,020
because they may just legal out more
information is they don't have the same

382
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,610
level back to me and you know that

383
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,700
you know Sally in jester going to a
concert that night but Sally wall post

384
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,370
stuff on Twitter because at one point
she almost got

385
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,470
caught cheating on her husband because
her husband found out things she doesn't

386
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,559
do it anymore

387
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,860
majeste foes all over time and she to
post pictures

388
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,120
up Sally and the dude at concert like
lol its ok look at the making out like

389
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,860
yeah Facebook a home you wanna find
those people right because we need the

390
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,670
track them real time

391
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:24,410
up so we want to look at how we can
overly and analyze the places that we

392
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,470
felt good information

393
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,200
take that correlate that is something
reasonable arm

394
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,200
I might even go into this consumption
they have now figured out that I'm gonna

395
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,530
give a talk about why adults on these

396
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,720
because it's gonna take five hours but

397
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,580
look up something called low-tech self
and if you've never used it

398
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,090
which how know it is Ray was a really
hurt a bit

399
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:51,100
that so know XO is a Microsoft thing

400
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,450
and it's all about being able to take
multiple different data points

401
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,740
and create we did pieces of collusion
through importing them all into it so

402
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,820
K so part of this one

403
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,000
was importing them into Excel using a
couple different

404
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,090
data networks being able to now breakout
from those data networks who knew each

405
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,760
other

406
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,330
and then start to whittle down from who
knew each other to

407
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,770
this person know somebody here in know
somebody here but doesn't know someone

408
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,059
here so they go into the circle

409
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:24,600
this 10 someone here in here but doesn't
know won't hear it here so I don't at

410
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,570
the circle

411
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:30,640
now I can start seeing alright you know
someone else on five different social

412
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,610
networks but not on this one

413
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,220
so follow official or something like
that obviously I want to use the one

414
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,600
that they're not connected on

415
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,870
and be like yo I just got on this

416
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,470
I know that you know I'm connected to an
every other social networking for your

417
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,480
planet let him just

418
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,960
the no question that with it right right
away

419
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,430
are but also show you some really really
neat things

420
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,040
which you're gonna start seeing about
who they hang out with

421
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,460
way more you're gonna watch the lines
open right

422
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,820
as you're looking at these people in you
analyze these things are visual format

423
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,140
you start to see who they interact with
more

424
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,970
if it's not the one that you thought
then you now know

425
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,429
where to start watching streams

426
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:18,760
tax rates are coming out like when I did
it at their peak on

427
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,450
and I was checking people that were
connected to Kennedy and

428
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:26,480
we're taking Twitter in late did a
couple other ones

429
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,300
and I had it mapped the people that were
connected to him

430
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:35,360
on three out of four social networks
like it instantly pullout

431
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,809
the five or seven targets that work
connected on

432
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:42,179
on all 54 405 so I can actually some
things

433
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:45,350
that expense

434
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,110
art such analysis rights now we have all
the stuff that we want to get we know

435
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,590
who's easy to get information from we
know who their best friends are and how

436
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,350
to watch them to or don't have term

437
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:58,880
now we have to go after because you're
see what the relationship at this

438
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,990
are this is one of my favorite favorite
favorite favorite relationship passive

439
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:09,970
ever built okay there's the biggest
thing and x-men that this tells you that

440
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,280
no one's ever really willing to tell you

441
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,460
is that Professor X

442
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,559
to find his like or in the middle
somewhere

443
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:24,950
up sees also you can even find him cuz
he so fuckin irrelevant

444
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:28,720
it's just it's just so cool so hot

445
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,820
okay at their soap but

446
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,050
like E watery information

447
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,960
if you wanna spread a message to the
x-men about something

448
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,010
you give it to the professor you they
should the beast this is a body of

449
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,360
you give it to over remit everyone now
believes it is truth

450
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,160
he gets to become the bear love your
message so when you swallow start

451
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,240
creating spies in an organization or
leaking intelligence

452
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,840
or saying oh there's this new thing that
you should use because it's really

453
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,670
awesome

454
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:03,020
go try and directly engage that person
you directly engage the people who are

455
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,210
the head of their spirit

456
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:08,780
influence which we been able to find
through all the graphic we've been doing

457
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,230
another we have that relationship they
know we only go after that one person

458
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,360
and eventually our target comes to us

459
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,220
me babe or intelligence not

460
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,480
click find copied pasted to report

461
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,990
K you can do that stuff with case file

462
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,420
it's just how you do it

463
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,850
is gonna make sense or not right because
case file in Montego

464
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,600
in all these tools right the over
populate with data so what what

465
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,960
our job is as intel analyst for going
after these things

466
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,820
is the figure out data and cleansing
every single time we do an import

467
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:50,010
we do import we figure out what we're
using and how we're using it

468
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,920
we scrub everything else around it with
this is mildly important great put it on

469
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,470
my I'll be important folder and get

470
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,590
of your table right now because the more
that you have in front of it

471
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,980
the harder it's going to be for you to
figure out what your targets really are

472
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:07,490
on you can do that with cell phones also
suffered is anybody play with stockard

473
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:13,120
that that community made really cool

474
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,170
soho so it starts doing some others
mappings and those types of things for

475
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:17,660
you

476
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,309
the other cool thing about stalker
stalker I actually plug into some things

477
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:23,520
like cell phone networks

478
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,429
arm so you can so I figure out who's
talking to who

479
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:31,240
and then correlating those pieces of
data back to collusion patterns users

480
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,160
have influence

481
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,290
that be convenient to know I don't
associate with you on

482
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:41,010
any social network whatsoever but I send
you a hundred text messages a day

483
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:44,010
haha why

484
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:49,570
how come no one else is both know you
know that for sale what do you do in

485
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:54,480
arm about dr. sense those guys inside
the same thing

486
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,320
there are a lot more very about it which
I love them for

487
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,530
I me because they're actually using
things like AR drones to create web

488
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:06,320
access points and use visual target
analysis

489
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,480
in order to fly over the people so they
can continue to be their cell phone

490
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,220
tower and watch them all they all

491
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,670
and then pull that information back in
for Chorley its reports maps

492
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:20,380
cool you get this stuff I O is James
Bond shit you go by

493
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,710
its awesome get

494
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:28,330
snake you know you want right so we
gotta go get 'em

495
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:31,590
you know we are looking right we gotta
get up on that person

496
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,730
know where this remote sending things
that game's done with

497
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:40,410
ed first we figure out our take out
plans for

498
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:44,110
John official and a cop rise makes
finally here we can ease on-site attacks

499
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,130
might like

500
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:48,660
you know start hitting on her best
friend

501
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,480
has had other bets for insist there some
kinda like a path remove my sleep be

502
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,830
around the areas that I need to

503
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:59,840
up are we gonna go and create other
types of intelligence leaks in the or

504
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,840
find somebody because we did all santo
collection that

505
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,440
is super duper pissed off the company
and then feed them some

506
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,610
evidence because if your intelligence
gathering that gives them what they need

507
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,350
to be

508
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,920
really pissed and then trade them

509
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,610
anger information is an awesome tree
because people are so fired up that they

510
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,390
want to be right

511
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:23,360
when you confirm that you've listed this
huge weight of their shoulder

512
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,010
and kiss them off so you've got them to
get an excuse to behave

513
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:30,720
even more poorly but they see it was
like the messiah

514
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,030
truth because you like help you like
like for 10 years I've known this been

515
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,370
going on in finally showed me like

516
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:41,580
I love you you know like whatever and
you can just get them to do

517
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:45,309
all sorts of fun stuff for you so maybe
you need to send back the person

518
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:50,340
get me we've got to the office for Daisy
about other stuff whatever dis

519
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,450
K or you know I yes can read

520
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,980
going through making shell companies
things like that you can actually

521
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,030
attacked the business

522
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:01,280
something this and arm once you get it

523
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,750
you I have to get in so I put some
things that

524
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,559
and put it all over New updated 18 talks
million I talk about

525
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:13,280
classes on here I just because if you
get no other info you can copy these two

526
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,860
sides and be like yeah I

527
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,170
when I don't want people home so

528
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:21,660
you gotta get inside right so you could
do all the you know as the stuff you

529
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,840
like your way and you could dress up
funny

530
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,280
you get kick a door and all that stuff
or you do we usually do which is

531
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,350
electronically get a min ago on that
system and then you're the bad sister

532
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:36,770
you go and you make yourself a bad turn
you over our bed

533
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:41,340
they give you a badge right the fact
that

534
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,559
you're in a bad system and like your
pictures and all that shit so white

535
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,200
you're obviously oil company who
accidents

536
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,070
arm and some are going to talk about
those are what you read them

537
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:58,020
and know how completely ridiculous

538
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:04,170
opp bag systems are built for security
guards

539
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:07,670
yeah yeah they're not real complex

540
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:13,270
if you know I'm sayin the passwords are
not real complex

541
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,710
like the passwords are not real complex

542
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:20,309
at all K

543
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:25,270
it how yep this one super awesome

544
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:29,900
cuz its ERA kinda brings up anyway
little pseudo web interface and you

545
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,210
can't change the database aspect

546
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:37,470
kitty breaks yeah they told me oh yeah
you

547
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:42,000
you to change it said I was like I'm all
the manuals them imprinted since like 98

548
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,340
in it that's not true

549
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:49,840
ok where you have the update manual cuz
you're not a customer Mike

550
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,250
right on dude it your you got it

551
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:58,020
um even funnier like once you start
looking into one of these are

552
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,370
the two biggest that systems in the
world

553
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,580
they get deployed the most places you
got a 50-50 shot

554
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,860
getting one of these two if you buy the
best up

555
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,809
they have do worse web app all abilities
your ever see

556
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:19,190
an hour anything about web app so I
can't tell you how to bits with them but

557
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:24,290
home like to the point of view could
just like slash

558
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:27,470
write down stuff and get anonymous
access which is valid

559
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:30,900
but it's a good you access to missus
officers called nonce actors

560
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,570
have a page which I guess they met like
anonymous the crew

561
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:37,970
like here's how you own it not like

562
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:41,240
an individual we don't know the lady was
like a gift

563
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,470
of a so when you're doing after you get
that you are also automate finding some

564
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,429
of these things right finding the bad
systems will find

565
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:52,750
I what port so they're so like you know
go through

566
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,700
take my talk at some point go through
grab all those ports that was talking

567
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,299
about

568
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:59,679
and look through the network for that
stuff adjust

569
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,290
just touch the box once and you realize
how like old and decrepit

570
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:06,600
F up is because like the security people
just only type in like

571
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,100
okay no and then they're like you know
chicken scratch nightly reports

572
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,840
up webcams are awesome

573
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,650
and security cameras awesome I mean what
a better place the campout

574
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:22,720
and watch what their passwords are or
anything else

575
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,990
the wonderful PTZ camera systems where
you can just start learning more and

576
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:30,150
more and more about the environment it's
not about getting it right now it's

577
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,730
about getting at some point

578
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:36,929
just archive it watch it hang out like
but consider watching tv watch this is

579
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:37,850
way more fun

580
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:42,390
you the interactive it

581
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:45,799
any so

582
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:50,000
when you do this just go through script
up really quickly

583
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,240
all the porch or look for got all the
banners there you go take all the Google

584
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,549
dorks from all the cameras

585
00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:58,970
and parse all your banner lot against
the Google dorks so it's like you're

586
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,809
good looking but

587
00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:04,710
its eternal I and your you'll find a bad
system offers like two or three minutes

588
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:08,419
its its super for arm

589
00:34:08,419 --> 00:34:11,690
alright getting someone's phone

590
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:16,639
arm so we've all sat there and on like
this under light before

591
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,419
a that makes you look stupid and it
takes time

592
00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:23,029
and then you get it wrong and then your
plants are all over the thing which

593
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:25,700
kinda extra screws up the whole covert
surveillance

594
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,940
peace so don't do that arm

595
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,669
use wetting agents right that's 14
slippers

596
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:36,559
do it ch45 is like

597
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,029
four books for a majority you can make
it really even cheaper

598
00:34:40,029 --> 00:34:43,950
arm go to an art store and get the
finest level graphite powder that you

599
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:44,929
can find

600
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:48,229
poor dawn Poppe phone just shake the
thing out you'll see this really

601
00:34:48,229 --> 00:34:50,429
distinct pattern

602
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:55,119
hey if you wanna get the codes of the
alarm system or something like that

603
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:55,569

tight has always really cool shit

606
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,180
if it glows if anybody's ever da nasa

609
00:35:15,749 --> 00:35:19,349
because it drives some walk over and
touch the keys in

610
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:25,609

just kick it when you get physically
next to someone stings

616
00:35:45,989 --> 00:35:49,249
that's when it gets really fun and I
think that's a lot of times the like

617
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:53,130
pen test the tape community breaks down
because they're like I'm cutting my hair

627
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:28,079
you know but like in that's nothing to
say that the tool because

628
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,109
that some awesome shit that everyone
should use anyway but

629
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:35,229
takeover when your key logging like
break

630
00:36:35,229 --> 00:36:39,729
I E so that it kinda does not work
writer mad slow or loads every page nine

631
00:36:39,729 --> 00:36:43,910
times before displays it like this fun
settings for that matter why they exist

632
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:48,390
arm but then make Firefox fast and super
awesome like do a little

633
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:53,170
you know faster box or whatever like all
the present weeks and so it kicks ass in

634
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,759
a subtext are used by rocks and then use
like

635
00:36:56,759 --> 00:36:59,769
keylogger editions in Firefox because
then

636
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:03,420
their AV isn't gonna find it cuz the AV
never looks above

637
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,819
XBIZ of they don't care they just look
at like the browser helper: objects bull

638
00:37:07,819 --> 00:37:10,049
shit like that they don't look at the
fun

639
00:37:10,049 --> 00:37:13,220
cool XBIZ put in their specially finger
right

640
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:17,069
and now you have a really awesome
keylogger for all the shady bullshit

641
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,999
that they're doing on the Internet like

642

not good for me

644
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:33,329
I it's you want to use that stuff let's
just let it sit

645
00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:38,720

the obvious stuff

654
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:13,410
everybody likes to chat with each other

655
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:17,900
you know digs me is great they got their
password except somebody figured out

656
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,549
exactly how it works and its you know
they've made in the utility to

657
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:25,009
a cryptic the passwords see you click it
and it goes but

658
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:28,869
that's worth arm pigeon pigeon is the
best

659
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:32,420
you got that purple and open in a text
editor that all the fat surgery click

660
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,130
plain text

661
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:37,539
school good to have

662
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:41,539
in okie passes is excellent for things
like that

663
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:45,559
if %uh if you can't get it and they have
some

664
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:48,640
you know ninja shit running on the
machine don't feel like a free to just

665
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,180
go old school might put a keylogger into
the thing that fine in Windows like

666
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:52,779
between

667
00:38:52,779 --> 00:38:56,119
askin especially if you look at it and
see dust

668
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:00,390
you know like weird cookies from the
eighties like other shit back there like

669
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:03,479
they never go back there anyway just
hide it under the nastiest dirtiest

670
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:08,229
yucky thing that there is because
wranglers anyway up

671
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:12,059
enterprises use the hell a key for us
which is awesome

672
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:15,539
because you know the front end of key
pass

673
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:18,470
doesn't work really well when you use a
keylogger but everything else is

674
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,450
awesomely gifted

675
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,779
and you know but super duper secure but
key logger who cares yea

676
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:28,049
i win best passer arm there's also these
other things if anybody starts looking

677
00:39:28,049 --> 00:39:29,410
into them and I

678
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:34,289
totally and not gonna say anything about
it except for look into them

679
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:39,450
but these are all the it's like add-ons
the key past so that

680
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:42,970
you can use KeePass in IE in it
automatically fills your passwords and

681
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,460
for every other website by

682
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,470
taking a master password which in stores
and I for you and

683
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,430
and associating that with the sites and
thus making it like you're single

684
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,710
sign-on

685
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,829
label love thing

686
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:59,819
and think about that I he has the passer
or being

687
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:02,999
get a

688
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:08,789
mmm overlook add-ons right attacking the
third party is almost always the easy

689
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:11,380
way because the third parties like the
trust thing

690
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:15,079
and then like it I could be suspicious
upkeep aspin out of this XP I

691
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,819
that it's the Holy Firefox especially if
you find out that the really need that

692
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:21,420
shit just make one

693
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,799
like and don't let it work and install
soda machine that way

694
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:29,440
I so yet now it weird

695
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,160
of fun let's also if they always have
probably done in one way shape or form

696
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,569
right

697
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:39,440
but how are you guys really watch people

arm getting geared a lot people's a
blast

699
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:46,099
you got a first figure out how to hide
now

700
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:51,259
the the role of hiding anything is
always be in plain sight

701
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:55,279
the best for all because one you're
gonna get the best information

702
00:40:55,279 --> 00:40:59,589
a2 the last place to work

703
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:02,729

734
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:46,200
inside above the area where your target

everybody knows when you know the final
moment happens you won't have that

736
00:42:50,249 --> 00:42:51,239
matrix view

737
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:56,450

750
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:36,059
the power lines

751
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:40,009

00:43:40,009 --> 00:43:45,049
using GSM and CDMA is a great way
because the higher frequency so it's not

753
00:43:45,049 --> 00:43:46,910
to get your normal RF bugs

754
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:51,400
giving them poise is really cool giving
their kids toys is even cooler

755
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,069
a home my kids toy isn't listening to me

756
00:43:55,069 --> 00:43:59,839
I'm okay don't be cheap

757
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,950
but if you wanna be cheap it's totally
okay

758
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:06,809
was in sciences really of is a whatever
that say before

759
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:12,390
it's a cool it will make stuff site did
a whole series on making like spy gear

760
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:16,019
right so 3 volt DC power supply

761
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:19,559
NPN translator a cell from

762
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:23,130
a nightlight or just a regular like
photocell right

763
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:26,960
anally and some headphones an amplifier

764
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,009
that now you have

765
00:44:30,009 --> 00:44:33,190
what the FBI calls their ten thousand
dollar interceptor

766
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:38,140
the Interceptor 10 because interceptor
once a single laser and it's

767
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:41,739
like a mild a rock they have some other
factors as shit but the

768
00:44:41,739 --> 00:44:45,420
intercept 9 the big one that they used
to catch you talking

769
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,150
arm when you're I do interviews or
something like that is like a hundred

770
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:49,999
thousand dollars

771
00:44:49,999 --> 00:44:54,049
in this was a little bit better than
receptor-1 arm

772
00:44:54,049 --> 00:44:57,749
because likes 17 bucks but

773
00:44:57,749 --> 00:45:01,509
Italy's are likely to my job really
really easy in principle rate usually

774
00:45:01,509 --> 00:45:04,950
laser at something as long as I can keep
it stable on a tripod

775
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:08,680
I can make it so that should strictly
back at me I can use my photo sensor

776
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,349
take what comes into the photo sensor

777
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:14,200
up with that amplifier implicit yeah

778
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,059
a my bordering has glass windows

779
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:21,670
0 why because here's all your
information tape recorder

780
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:24,670
right overhears on the information i bug

781
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:28,059
really technologically cool hears only
information call into the solar cuz I

782
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:28,969
got the cell phone

783
00:45:28,969 --> 00:45:33,349
it under the table although he's only
information here's me pointless born are

784
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:34,779
you laughing with headphones on

785
00:45:34,779 --> 00:45:37,999
okay K

786
00:45:37,999 --> 00:45:41,460
making but making FM bugs are still
really practical really useful

787
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:47,009
the religion science véronique it takes
but two minutes to make this shit arm

788
00:45:47,009 --> 00:45:52,999
in touch %uh is one of the great a NBC
is what a great car tracking companies

789
00:45:52,999 --> 00:45:54,170
they work everywhere

790
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:58,299
globally three months for 240 bucks and
you can track somebody real time

791
00:45:58,299 --> 00:46:01,349
walk-up social underneath their car

792
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:05,569
and giggle as you watching driver handle
I get

793
00:46:05,569 --> 00:46:09,390
if you show the CEO a map of like here's
where you've been all day

796
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:18,289
touch

797
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:21,329
you can make zones so I can put a fence
up

798
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:24,769
and be like any time they leave their
love fenced area you have to let me know

799
00:46:24,769 --> 00:46:27,279
until then I don't really care about it
because they can be shady in the

800
00:46:27,279 --> 00:46:29,480
neighborhood but they got other
neighborhood I wanna know

801
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,630

802
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:36,859
those arm I'm not gonna talk is only
have like two minutes

803
00:46:36,859 --> 00:46:40,469
up cameras in the car

with one that has cameras all over it so

806
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,099
that you can see what's going on in
their car

807
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:54,670
because they're doing weird shady stuff
in their car you want to know that

808
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:58,529

812
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:14,549
information

813
00:47:14,549 --> 00:47:18,029
bank

814
00:47:18,029 --> 00:47:22,249
but their cell phones anybody's
mobiStealth rainy those before

815
00:47:22,249 --> 00:47:25,730
our sausages shows you everything that
they're doing every call that they made

816
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:29,319
every SMS that they sent their GPS
location if it's on the front of the

817
00:47:29,319 --> 00:47:31,519
sent the email to pictures by a while

818
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:34,589
if you can track it because you get it
on their cell phone make a cellphone

819
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:37,660
tower

820
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:41,880
so hard it's gonna cost like $5 Bryant

821
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,239
arm you know use also Common Era probe

822
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:49,329
in some the THC sniffing stuff its it
simply army

823
00:47:49,329 --> 00:47:54,469
idiot when it comes to the texan I can
bilbies so what you eat easily build she

824
00:47:54,469 --> 00:47:57,890
and you know get it kind of close you
don't really have to mean you get to see

825
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:59,670
all want other people stuff just

826
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:04,559
should be quiet a home now my favorite
one in this is under spend my last

827
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:05,670
second on this

828
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:10,230
are is I love blackberry good sox's a
phone and everything else but it's just

829
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:15,400
just it just runs you know it just has
that like old school I still run

830
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,690
functionality to it but I like so you
pull it apart

831
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:21,920
any shove it in the little area above

832
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,509
where the people speaker is that they
use their Bluetooth connection

833
00:48:25,509 --> 00:48:29,219
and their catch and all the other crap
that they talk to you and

834
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:33,609
hint all you have to do is just get on
the mic phone maker reed switch

835
00:48:33,609 --> 00:48:36,680
so that you can pair the microphone love
this

836
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,710
and Bridget to the microphone inside the
car which is already have to fight for

837
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:40,319
you which is

838
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:44,579
totally convenient and then you put some
software on the phone which you can

839
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:48,430
easily go get you know these or others

840
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:51,819
you know get phone super there's other
lot there's lotsa lotsa stuff there's a

841
00:48:51,819 --> 00:48:54,190
lotta Topp

842
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:58,549
and then you take what are these because
there's so much power up in that area

843
00:48:58,549 --> 00:48:59,980
where the lights are

844
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,410
and you hard wire your USB power supply
into it

845
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:06,489
and now you have a fully functional Bob
Carr

846
00:49:06,489 --> 00:49:11,019
with GPS in phone in all sorts of other
capabilities that you can dial into

847
00:49:11,019 --> 00:49:14,109
anytime you'd like to see what's going
on in your car

848
00:49:14,109 --> 00:49:17,539
and if you do it the right way which I
learned how to do later

849
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:21,869
up you can actually attach this to your
DVR

850
00:49:21,869 --> 00:49:25,150
and as the drive around like watch them
real time video

851
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:28,089
and have the heads up above where
they're going and who they're talking to

852
00:49:28,089 --> 00:49:29,390
in San indexes

853
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:33,719
to you see them like this you like with
the texting you just log into that you

854
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:34,960
can see with their texting

855
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,029
employees that have fun display to show
somebody

856
00:49:38,029 --> 00:49:42,140
here's where your ride Wednesday it take
to disperse in nineteen times between

857
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,819
here and here

858
00:49:43,819 --> 00:49:46,410
your face is really funny when you
almost got into an accident because you

859
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:47,469
rear ended that dude

860
00:49:47,469 --> 00:49:52,719
because you were texting at 14 minutes
and three seconds into the video

861
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:56,119
why did you say this

862
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:59,599
um I only had gone so

863
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,619
my my made only hope that this is that

864
00:50:03,619 --> 00:50:07,789
it gives you some ideas on what else we
can do

865
00:50:07,789 --> 00:50:11,839
as far as getting physical and working
within around people to do what we do

866
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:15,869
not always have it be our meeting click
my fish

867
00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:18,150
and stop it
