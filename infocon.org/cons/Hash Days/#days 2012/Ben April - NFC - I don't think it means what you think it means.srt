1
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,290
are pressure

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,910
for on who's used to see was played with
it

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:18,449
effect arm so the basic just to this

4
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,090
is that so when you start digging in the
further you dig in the more you find out

5
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,649
the more nuances you find related to
what NSC

6
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:31,430
really means what it some people think
it means on

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,620
it gets a little crazy are also talk a
little bit about

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,719
how it secure where it's secure where
it's not secure were doesn't try to be

9
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,379
secure

10
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:43,739
aren't there a lot of you know what is
what a great exciting talks

11
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,780
on a conference or get right now about
who a broken seda

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,000
well you can do the same thing with a QR
code

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,290
in many cases on you know it's a really
at the end of the day it's a

14
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,989
it's a cue way to get data into out of
mobile devices

15
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:00,230
arm because it's got some critical
applications

16
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:05,729
arm but I hope nobody is really
approaching and and expecting a whole

17
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:06,759
have a lot of security

18
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:10,430
on as far as far as that goes

19
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,569
on so these my friends John Larry

20
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:17,209
they were you ever Mason University good
buddies

21
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:20,749
early adopters like most the people in
this room I'm always grab a new gadget

22
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:21,999
always playing with a new toy

23
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,759
I always trying to one-up each other in
and and have a good time

24
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,759
so one day John get pics up a a Samsung
Galaxy Nexus

25
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,420
as the setting it up finds that that
great checkbox

26
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,579
your yes or no for an SE on

27
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,409
and you know like most the people we
know it's the interwebs to figure out

28
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:43,369
what is it what does it do do I want
this check box on do I want it off

29
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,369
you know is it safe is it unsafe

30
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:49,990
what do I do arm aka

31
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,439
on at the end the day if you if you
really do some digging the Finder 3

32
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,609
kinda main understandings what I see is

33
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:00,159
on first one is this really any

34
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,749
close range wireless communication are
if you look hard enough you see people

35
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,189
talking about Bluetooth

36
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:08,660
as an SE or WiFi if the devices are
close enough

37
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,220
a psych you're a okay near Radio Field
Communication

38
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,330
sure you can you can kinda get away with
calling it that but thats

39
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,390
obviously not what most people think
think are the next category

40
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,430
I saw 1809 to on most

41
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,340
of white people call nfc-enabled NFC
capable

42
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,430
and olive NFC falls in into his pocket
on the sky is the main core

43
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,520
spec that makes up most of the a
high-frequency

44
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,870
RFID type activities I am talking about
to loop antennas

45
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,250
I in your field communicating no
induction

46
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,360
magnetic induction on so this entirely
encompasses all a fantasy

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,900
but there are a whole lot of other areas
payment systems what's the transit

48
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,800
system's

49
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,030
arm your hotel some hotel key cards

50
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,450
on all kinda fall into this bucket but
are really and I see

51
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,040
on and finally we get to you

52
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,860
everything above this also exchanging
what they call and F records

53
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:14,210
arms so the NFC Forum which was set up
to kinda promote

54
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,140
annexed and and and advance and FC
because I've NFC

55
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,460
arm as defined this the standard and
it's just a real

56
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,040
really simple framework for exchanging
information are

57
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,100
and efferent NSC data exchange format

58
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,810
it I'll train a few minutes it's really
simple arm but if you're doing all these

59
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,860
things you can then go to the NFC Forum
and get blast and get an official stamp

60
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,840
of approval but yes this is really an
NFC application

61
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,850
iraq arm all kinds exciting are

62
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,030
so St form defines for tech types on

63
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,190
topaz a made by Broadcom

64
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,970
to our division a Broadcom called
envision are these really fast he's a

65
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,890
really light

66
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:03,209
arm they're also really small are
usually talk about her 56 bytes

67
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,350
arm you know good for you are all

68
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,720
may be a very small fee card not a lot
more than that on

69
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,430
the XP Phillips there's actually two
categories on

70
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,019
the type 2 carts are commonly referred
to as my fair

71
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,720
classic and my fair ultralight on

72
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,340
those fit into their they are also
pretty small

73
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,860
on under K with the storage

74
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,699
the use the My Fair are standard will
talk about we'll talk with communication

75
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:35,069
center said a bit

76
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:40,360
are there is another version on there's
a there's an imaginary type 5

77
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,999
on bed I includes but 1k tax

78
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:47,289
arm which in three who 2k 4k and 8k

79
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:50,550
but arm this is also made by an XP
Phillips

80
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,659
and it is a slightly different arm

81
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:57,210
number structure it's also got different
authentication structure

82
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,560
on and a/c form didn't hasn't lasted

83
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,060
they keep threatening to however Samsung

84
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,800
and I've heard as recently as yesterday
that Nokia has also started using bad as

85
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,909
their

86
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:13,490
arm as one of their common tak types

87
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,949
so if you get the Samsung tactile ap and
you get a tax that come with it they're

88
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:19,789
actually 1k taxed

89
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:25,159
are which means NFC devices out in the
field aren't necessarily required to

90
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,090
support them

91
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,139
only devices are that use that there are
explicitly coded to do so

92
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:34,849
can support the stacks so one thing to
be careful love is when you're

93
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:37,930
if you're going to put into sea in a
public environment you get very careful

94
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,219
to select one before tech types

95
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:45,029
so that's everyone can read it are
otherwise you run into a condition where

96
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:48,430
it's possible you can put a tag out
there your NFC device can read your

97
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,930
buddies NFC device can read it but

98
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,240
you know somebody else can because it's
not actually

99
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,550
following us back on the type 3 tax

100
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:02,240
made by Sony they range from I think I
think getting a small 64k and all we

101
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,379
have to take a

102
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:07,800
on these are brought awful slow

103
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,039
arm but they've got good crypto they've
got good

104
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,879
style outbreak protective ability
they've got good security

105
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,939
are also kinda expensive on there's the

106
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:21,650
my fair does fire line

107
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,439
%ah this is the type for tag are also by
an XP Phillips

108
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,939
together and a lot of this on there are
couple different variants

109
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:32,439
the test fired we'll talk about that
later there's one type that's really

110
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,839
good and the others

111
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,389
are functionally broken not really
practical yet

112
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:41,659
on but just got a real quick summer
zation if you wanna do like a URL

113
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,789
something simple

114
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:47,620
type1 type2 tax a great if you wanna do
something that require some real

115
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,879
it security for lack of a better term if
you wanna

116
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,219
do something put it out the public make
it available and

117
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:57,770
expect that no one's going to be easily
able to change it you probably want to

118
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,210
do something

119
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,029
I like to take three to four good is
also if you being something large large

120
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,849
URL

121
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:08,999
you need to go there too tight for

122
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:12,960
so I i'm sorry for the long text this is
kinda helping stack up

123
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,020
and its arm I'll be honest I actually
left out a couple layers has are just

124
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,879
confusing in

125
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,449
and not really necessary to explain it
on down at the bottom

126
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:26,300
you got to with a wired interface Bev
there's a nice a standard to describe

127
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,740
the connection between the radio and the
transponder

128
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,369
and for some reason they want to specify
that but

129
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:36,930
nothing else the low-level I 80003

130
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,400
I so I talks about the to prevent as

131
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,520
in close proximity so RFID falls under
that are pretty much anything

132
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,710
anything inductive us to the I so tight
092 we talked about already

133
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,169
this is where normal hit the cards

134
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:56,330
approx cards on fall into this category

135
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,589
but they're a different frequency third
are much lower frequency

136
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:04,039
I anything and SE it's going to be the
13.56 megahertz

137
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:08,289
attended the its conjures commonly
referred to as the high-frequency cards

138
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:11,930
on the antenna can also be a lot smaller

139
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,089
got some examples over here if you know
quarter sized

140
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:19,490
and tennis on so

141
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,849
I'm gonna jump up here desi AP to you
the Slayers really important

142
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:27,099
in in some other more advanced aP's if
you've got to

143
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:31,479
smart devices talking to each other very
usually capable of speaking

144
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:36,010
anymore these protocols out so you gonna
wear here that they added

145
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,960
well as well as any a car type single
layer here added

146
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,240
to negotiate between the two devices
which combination protocols you're gonna

147
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,370
speak

148
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,170
so that got us both in here over here
we've got lrcp

149
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,220
is love communication protocol two
devices communicating directly with each

150
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,980
other

151
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:00,170
arms so if you see me a Samsung at City
Hall to Samsung phones together and they

152
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,670
you know she's up a movie year or
something like that that's usually going

153
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,230
to happen

154
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,250
in lrcp and on simple

155
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,470
and F exchange protocol possible at

156
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,050
isometric 15 693 is called the Senate
e-cards not very common in the wild

157
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,300
they work to about a meter meter and a
half on

158
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,810
so much much longer range of 14 443

159
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,840
is the most common if you've got a and
then to see

160
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,480
or my for car your pocket its most
likely one of those on

161
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,810
there are three subclasses Taipei is my
fair

162
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,120
type B is a patent free version

163
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,350
%uh a just same kinda concepts

164
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,750
just just patent free arm types see

165
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,370
the Sony fell aka standard was actually
proposed as Type C

166
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,550
and rejected says we're worth restoring
their

167
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,690
arm

168
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,400
go I yeah so we got four types again and
then that fifty magic 50 type called an

169
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,130
XP

170
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:03,070
our type 5 depending on who you talk to
on top of that we've got and F

171
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,220
we'll talk about a minute and and after
itself has

172
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,500
a number of use cases are smart poster

173
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,930
URL v-card jewelry that will talk about
those in the second

174
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,040
arm so they're also

175
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,060
beyond but the standardize use cases
there a couple others all

176
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,200
a run through real quick una arm alright
so

177
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,400
john thinks it's honestly think schools
going to try it because bison goes by so

178
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,480
few tax

179
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,320
on first 16 oz coffee table

180
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,750
and programs that for on wifi handover

181
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,960
head over after pretty cool you program
in your WiFi details

182
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,130
so it's so when your buddies come over
that's what the phone and put their on

183
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,570
your network

184
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,110
you don't have to got to key in your web
key whatever I casa do the same thing

185
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,700
with Bluetooth

186
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,710
arm so the next tag is going to install

187
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,000
just connects to the front door when he
comes home tags: phone

188
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,170
and and and Texas girlfriend you know I
am home

189
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,000
finance take one on the on the shelf in
refrigerator to remind himself to pick

190
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,630
up milk on the way home

191
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:09,380
really simple applications really kinda
speed that NSC was really intended for

192
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:14,380
you know low security requirement
nothing major going on but it's just

193
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,810
kinda convenient less typing on your
phone

194
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,270
at that's really what you don't on at
the other day a lot of these can also be

195
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,810
done with your kids

196
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,640
I with the right app

197
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,520
arts have got the use cases %ah and
actually in most cases if you look at

198
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,250
the tag

199
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:35,900
phone calls SMS messages and number
others are actually implemented as a URL

200
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,980
us just it's just nice and easy to parse
on

201
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,910
v-card falls into the mine and you can
actually include any my mob checked that

202
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,510
will fit on the card

203
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,910
our secure send an imager excel file

204
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,370
whatever it will fit in there so these
are kind of a standard known use cases

205
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,700
that most Tennessee

206
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,850
devices can support there are also
non-standard use cases so Samsung's got

207
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,880
an app

208
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,230
arm their couple other apps you third
party apps you can get where you program

209
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,550
a tag and say you know hey set the alarm

210
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,060
change the brightness change the the
rare volume whatever

211
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,800
on it will write a URL for the tag that
will teach the no telephone what to do

212
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,110
but it won't necessarily work for
devices that don't have that app

213
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,880
I'm so it's good it's kinda another
gotcha is if you have your protagonist

214
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,890
in

215
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,960
in the public field you've got to be
careful to make sure that

216
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,040
arm the the application you're using

217
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,000
is using a standard and F format that
other applications can understand

218
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,310
on government the and a format here real
quick

219
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:39,100
are two main components the message
which is literally just an array of

220
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,980
records

221
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,910
i has no header and footer are it's just
a set records

222
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,820
are the key thing to note here is mobile
devices as of this moment

223
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,410
only support one end of record on win
reading from a static device or a tag

224
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,370
or a passive devices on however if you
want to

225
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,490
active devices talk to each other you
can exchange as many as you want

226
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,800
on so this actually has great
implications for security

227
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,100
on you know if I find attack in the wild
can't

228
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,930
I can even if it's not right protected I
can add additional aP's

229
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:16,220
or additional records after it but the
devices into wasn't on its only gonna

230
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,960
pay attention to the first one

231
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,380
I'm so it's kind it's a little bit
harder to to stop in something

232
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,360
malicious after the fact on

233
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,020
so the A&F record has a very simple
format on

234
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,010
book got message begin this agenda bits

235
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:37,470
I chunk flax in case four bytes payload
size isn't enough for you

236
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,760
if you want a four gig payload you can
chuck it into multiple messages

237
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,100
I'm sorry records on

238
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,390
so few set the short record bit you lose
three

239
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,580
by to payload Sudan you're limited to
155 bites

240
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,850
arm lot of ataxia wilder actually
shorter like that

241
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,320
you also get the ID field and I D life I

242
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,260
I haven't actually seen them used the
ideas you put a URL or some UUID

243
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,530
on the tag she could tell whether you've
seen it before

244
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,580
there's a bet that you can turn their of
their

245
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,480
and pack it in I most the text you see
in the wild have the short format

246
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,250
very very compressed for simple on and
then you get the type name field

247
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,900
ones are tightening format

248
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,370
the type name three bites simply tells
the

249
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,570
application what format to expect

250
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:34,080
type in I it's either going to be
well-known which is her supple you for

251
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,730
URL

252
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,570
SP for smart poster other couple others
or it's going to be a mime type:

253
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,040
in in the vast majority of cases
something literally just that the text

254
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,420
text last plane arm would be a perfect
example there

255
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,970
other couple others for for other
applications that you want to get

256
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,710
creative and include you are I

257
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,270
or your own random string

258
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:01,080
again it's pretty simple format alright
so I body Larry decides to

259
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,530
you know not to be outdone he's goes out
picks up galaxy s3

260
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,250
and decides to have some fun with John
so what was the

261
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,000
buy milk tag in refrigerator on

262
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,710
suggested he should probably go by Larry
more beer I

263
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:19,870
you know and and honey I'm home is no
now now text now emails john is a

264
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,180
routes are larry is a yeah I'll come
over in some chance food

265
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,740
on this brings us to the quite important
topic write protect

266
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,680
arm right out of the box all these tags
are read/write

267
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,040
arm you can order tax Britain hardcoded
from the factory

268
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,690
that cannot be changed by any currently
known method

269
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,520
are if your gonna put attack in the wild
that's definitely the way to do it

270
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,700
%uh some offer side topaz among others
offer a one-time program feature

271
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:55,700
watch out its one each bit can be set to
one wants

272
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,210
so if I can make your URL on the stag
malicious by adding

273
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,800
flipping a couple zeros 21 it's fair
game

274
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,190
Tom I'll talk about the key based on a
few minutes arm

275
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:11,010
don't use it if you can ever ever help
it arm

276
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,370
that's usually in the My Fair keys are
the mitre carts on

277
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,620
the access bits is actually pretty slick
there's a there's a structure

278
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,860
in some these cards were you can say if
it's got one or two keys you can say

279
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,830
which he's allowed to read in which he's
allowed to write

280
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,529
as possible set up in such a way that no
key is allowed to write

281
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:32,170
walking tag it's permanent I had so far
they're actually

282
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,910
that's actually rather reliable unless
you but the card from China

283
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,700
on finally most to the app's you're
gonna find for mobile device

284
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,110
have a soft write protect option which
might as well be called non-existent it

285
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,170
sets a bit in the text

286
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,560
that asks the next apt not to write it

287
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,800
square I thought it was a joke when I
for some atop

288
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,320
arm so if you wanna put a tag on the
field and the secure their couple

289
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,670
propose options one ovens I and SE SAK

290
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,230
ons actually using you know that the
curved %eh nAES

291
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,500
and looks like pretty goods pretty good
character design pretty gets back

292
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,150
are unfortunately most of the tax can't
handle processing required firsters

293
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,089
two-way

294
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:21,189
to a negotiation with the DH you've got
actually have smart device

295
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:24,959
arm on both sides art some other does
fire

296
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,420
and develop attacks can do most of this
on

297
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,610
unfortunately no he's using it arm

298
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,730
I grabbed us a couple weeks ago notice
the update date:

299
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,320
on these are the defined crypto

300
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,630
configurations for the NFC sex standard
and right now the organization that

301
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,150
created in the first place has

302
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,610
is the only one registered arm

303
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:53,010
doesn't look like it's heavily used arm
and I haven't actually seen any examples

304
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,150
publicly available I there's another one
call Dennis e cig

305
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,650
it adds a new record to the end of
message

306
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:05,740
are with the signature unfortunately
unless you have an external

307
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,420
reliable trust network on fat signature
is going to get huge because you're

308
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,880
gonna need the entire chain of trust

309
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,640
in there I'm which immediately means
you're on to a bigger card

310
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,180
are possibly too big for most cards on
so

311
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,330
again we don't see this used in a while
very much also

312
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,540
those divide the mobile devices that are
only gonna read the first record

313
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,040
are going to ignore the signature anyway

314
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,090
soul this one doesn't get very far

315
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,610
arm all rights just learned his lesson
arm

316
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,760
right protected before he walks away
from the tag

317
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,960
pretty easy I so I was in the airport
and saw this

318
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,760
arm and one other things

319
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,559
it took me a couple times passing by
before I realized what was going on

320
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,210
arm they're actually instructions here
bet if you on lock your Galaxy

321
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:01,080
I'm our galaxy s3 turn on SE and hold
the up to that spot in the poster

322
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,950
arm you'll actually get in this case I
think it's a free ebook for free song or

323
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:05,760
something

324
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,790
arm so you know obviously I would on my
Galaxy Nexus and

325
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:13,800
read the tag instead of on scanning it
have

326
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,690
and get points to your Alan whatever on

327
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,870
but it's pretty clear from this to me
that

328
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:24,720
most people take a little bit if you
walk by the same poster

329
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,600
in the airport and so I QR code you know
exactly what to do with it

330
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,870
you know you know there was a QR kit
bill you know what to do

331
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,110
arm but thats

332
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:40,160
pretty non intuitive so the SE forms
come out with this guy's copy and Mark

333
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,260
and the idea is when you see this on
you're supposed to train yourself to

334
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,220
immediately wave your phone at

335
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,090
arm not convinced it's a good idea

336
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,200
on also you gotta be a little careful
there a little

337
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,850
protective of their other copyright I
actually had to put a

338
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,020
warning but this is not actually
nfc-enabled because they don't want

339
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,770
people to get confused with

340
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,300
things that should be an a/c enable
mister don't think now

341
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,320
I

342
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,900
rights so II

343
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,790
no point other than I'm interested to
see what's going to happen in overtime

344
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,790
as

345
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:20,700
people start crying if share that this
is an SE capable

346
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,590
on another thing you you discover when
you start looking

347
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,140
at your possible malicious activity with
taxes are

348
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,260
I've put a tag you know say say I'm
running a restaurant and I put a tag on

349
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:32,880
the counter

350
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,490
with my Facebook like wink

351
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:41,840
I what's keeping somebody from coming
along slapping Varone tag over it

352
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,340
on to kinda counteract my tag

353
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,570
arm 10 things there is this actually a
redress going on

354
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,980
when when a tag a passive tag ends up in
a field

355
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,330
the first thing it's going to do is a
minute an anti-collision ID

356
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,830
your pseudo unique identifiers it's
going to

357
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,110
tell the device all the tags that are in
the field

358
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,510
the first device in the case if most
mobile devices

359
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:09,900
all mobile devices and most actual
reader devices

360
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:15,550
the first arm anti-collision ID that was
received

361
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,650
is the only tag cares about could be
thirty seven other tags in the field

362
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:23,300
it's only gonna care about the first
when it gets I'm so it'll

363
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,450
dole racing on and it's just that the
order

364
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,760
as far as power up initialize

365
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,210
how fast the tag will get the you ID to
you

366
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,820
are so if I had a a 1k on the counter

367
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,870
and some be slapped a desk are a topaz
on top of it

368
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,360
that topaz is going to win every time

369
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,860
on missus wanna thank you want to
consider is how do you

370
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,010
how would you keep that same I do you
keep somebody from

371
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,540
slapping a tag over yours under yours
arm

372
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:58,000
and possibly exposing your customers or
or users to

373
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,290
to some form a rest arm so I put this
guide together

374
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:05,920
on the admissible if you put a piece a
glass in front of attack

375
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,700
you can easily see whether something's
been stuck on it

376
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,650
and actually customers can figure that
out pretty quickly that hey there's

377
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,640
something stuck their orders not

378
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,790
on a poster drying whatever you want

379
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:22,179
indicating you know Jesus can wave your
phone here I and foil in some kinda

380
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:22,740
blocking

381
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,100
at actually it'll actually do the right
thing

382
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:31,820
I do note that not all tax most tax
don't work directly on metal

383
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,429
something you try are there are tax you
can buy for the manufacturing industry

384
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:38,850
that are designed to be slapped try to
appease a medal for shipment

385
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,920
are most tax don't so you need some
kinda spacer

386
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,410
if your gonna put a put a backstop in
there

387
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,600
alright so

388
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,940
solar decides is gonna go play with both
the cards at his

389
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,630
his company as restaurant arm

390
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,530
so now he comes up a pretty simple offer
you by three males

391
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,860
and you get a free starter I you know
it's easy to do all the servers have

392
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,040
phones that can

393
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:12,500
they can update everybody's card on the
fly I decides to use my for 1k cards

394
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:17,250
all good or something arm this is when
we get to stored value

395
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,340
a cart up there's actually a Sony fell
aka

396
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,020
used in the I Japanese subway system

397
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,929
arm cuts like a I

398
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:30,870
all indications are the circuit cards
and I felt the cards are actually pretty

399
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,770
rock salt

400
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:35,330
arm there's not a lot of indication that
anyone's broken through those yet

401
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,040
arm expect quite a bit education because

402
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,520
there's actually stored value right on
the card are they do back it up with the

403
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,440
database but

404
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,450
you sorry

405
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,480
technically it's on SE apt as its not
exchanging and death but it's using

406
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,730
you know 1809 to using all the same
stuff on

407
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,380
Mikey the Dez fire EV one series

408
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,260
is also known to be good at this time
there are other deaths Fire series cards

409
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,600
that are I'm one of them is

410
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,140
known practically broke in and one of
them is

411
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,530
theoretically functionally broken but
takes I think forty five thousand

412
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,400
dollars worth of equipment and 17

413
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,650
seven days to crack it arm so depending
on how motivated your attacker is

414
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,250
on if he's going to get an order
mozzarella sticks that's probably not a

415
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,510
big problem

416
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:33,390
arm alright so that's my kid over here

417
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,309
on actually I'll probably hang out in
the a hash center if you wanna

418
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,510
play whether talk talking to see arm

419
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:44,679
this is all you really need to deuce
quite a bit of an SE

420
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:50,090
I hacking and slashing on we've we've
heard a couple mentions approx mark 3

421
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,190
as a wonderful tool you can do

422
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:57,070
damn near anything you can do with any
other and as the device

423
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:00,790
on p.m. 05:32 I it's actually a

424
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:05,790
Arduino shield I and you can emulate
cards you can emulate tags:

425
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:10,350
all kinds of fun stuff I carry Galaxy
Nexus which has NFC capability

426
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:14,970
are most if the NFC work I do is
actually right from this device

427
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:18,460
on no cables I got it all fits in that
small talk in case that made it through

428
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,570
TSA security

429
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:22,990
twice a couple days ago arm

430
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:26,650
so it's really easy to move around the
stuff arm

431
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,330
and is quite a lot you can do I with
that kid alone

432
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,370
you can edit and read and write any of
the tags

433
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:37,270
i'd assuming no good crypto on the fella
card as fire

434
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,770
and no arm

435
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,500
no regard to their arm cases my fair you
can break the

436
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,580
the crypto extremely fast true that
later I

437
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,320
and you can actually put the antenna
approx mark between

438
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,000
an NFC exchange and sniff the actual
transaction

439
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,240
so depending on which car type you are
some of them running cryptid

440
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,980
most don't on again emulating tags and
devices

441
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,070
if you've got a arm

442
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,870
1809 1809 too bad for your office

443
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,640
to to get in the door I it's actually
pretty body for a deal to star for you I

444
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,370
D off at

445
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:24,370
and I clone it with the with brush mark

446
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,400
you now

447
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,080
kidding ago

448
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,130
okay arm so when I am counterattack in
the wild and you know

449
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,380
being be me and I see I am on I'm always
kinda can't stand it

450
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,309
on the first thing I do as I love this
one XP tag info

451
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:50,019
art it reads the tag and shows you
what's on the tag

452
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:53,549
if you don't bring up one of the zaps
first

453
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:56,990
you're going to find out that it's going
to on

454
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,830
the the OS if the phone can will
actually act on attack

455
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:04,309
so if it's a URL an email address
something like that it'll actually

456
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:08,460
do what it can to act on the tag without
giving you the opportunity to

457
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,570
decide whether you want to do this on so
I bring up with these guys

458
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:17,130
I you can get your forex dumps or if in
the case fantasy it gives you full

459
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:21,289
protocol Tampa what's there on really
bring

460
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:24,820
like I said that's why I use my phone
probably the most are

461
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,019
another fun tool is the clip senator up
again

462
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:32,260
you can structure the NFC message I

463
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,330
in cutting at the standard eclipse
pull-down structure

464
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:39,289
kinda menu I generates QQ QR code
there's

465
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:43,630
a there's also a web-based version and
there's an app

466
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:47,269
that can scan the QR code and the next
act that touches it will be

467
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:51,970
written with that tag I'm so for trying
things like fuzzing

468
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,120
and stuff like that this is just a
really easy way to quickly iterate

469
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,200
through a lot of a lot of combinations

470
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,809
I'm alright

471
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:04,730
I so I've been saying that my fair based
crypto keys are crap

472
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:08,210
arm see if I give you can example here

473
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:11,260
arm three weeks ago our team was in
Tokyo

474
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,559
all 20 of us for a for teen face to face
meeting

475
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:19,809
I'll check into the hotel and you should
see the smile on my face when they had

476
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:21,149
me in mind for $1 K card

477
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:26,169
on I had my gear with me scattered in
the in the elevator on the way up

478
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:29,169
and sure enough there was one sector
that was inflicted with a key

479
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:32,990
and the rest for was filled with zeros
can you wear my target was

480
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:37,620
got to the room quick shower within 45
minutes of arriving at the hotel

481
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,909
I had the crypto key arm so within an
hour

482
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:45,299
I had made a copy of my room key alright

483
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:48,409
good step 1: call the card easy to do

484
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:51,990
copy line for line are a byte for byte
to the new card

485
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,090
same key same place easy be

486
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,679
door opens game over arm

487
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,820
so decide to take a step further as the
guys roll then

488
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,950
sitting at the bar with my phone now
that it had two key in it I could

489
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,950
actually just read the card right from
the mobile

490
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:11,490
on everyone who would let me they let me
then

491
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,730
on I scan their card I

492
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,059
and and try to figure out what format
was turned out to be pretty easy

493
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:23,899
I night for five years just junk the 5d
here's the guest number

494
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:27,169
if you're not familiar with hotel key
systems on

495
00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:30,710
they have guessed number and every time
you checking in you guessed the

496
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,760
increment that number

497
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,330
and a walk what automatically ignore
anything before that number

498
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:38,960
right so

499
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,330
basically the idea is no matter what
other keys out there exist

500
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:46,169
when they hand the next cast their key
it's got the first time they use it in

501
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:47,010
the locketts gonna

502
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:51,010
obliterate all previous keys on we've
got a date

503
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:56,460
got interesting this is a hex dump and I
checked out on October 13th

504
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:01,179
gets better

505
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:04,659
that's a heck stop that's the time check
out was one o'clock

506
00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:08,240
was nice enough to give me half an hour
in a second

507
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,799
then we've got the room I D turns out
it's a monotonically increasing number

508
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,830
if you walk down the hall every door is
the next number

509
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:20,669
I and finally a discover the hard way
that the second line

510
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:25,029
which is mostly empty included a bit for
you're allowed to use the elevator or

511
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:25,490
not

512
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,909
I tried a card with just that bit

513
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:35,700
didn't work arm so this is written for
one sector that's got the key on it

514
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,220
at all that's there the rest the car is
completely blank

515
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,220
alright so we've got that I can call the
card

516
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,320
cool alright so get somebody in room 13
in there their their room ideas

517
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,600
is thirty on and somebody gives me the
key

518
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,260
their key I find a room ideas 34 effort
is pretty quick math to figure out what

519
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,520
room there in

520
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,820
turns out I was wrong was off by one

521
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,549
be I came down the next day and told me

522
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:11,149
vet the room next to his didn't exist it
was a sitting area

523
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:14,379
scratch that Outen proof if I had
actually gone upstairs I we found the

524
00:31:14,379 --> 00:31:17,220
right room

525
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,260
so alright I can clone and I can tell
you your room number from the key

526
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,639
we're getting close now for the killer

527
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:29,450
on or sitting in the sitting in the bar
with the guy from

528
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:33,389
at 12:25 a guy 12:27

529
00:31:33,389 --> 00:31:36,590
the guy from 12:26 sitting right back
there

530
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:40,000
he was upstairs doing email so

531
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,850
1225 1227 gave me their keys stand down

532
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,760
that's a pretty easy math social thank
on

533
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,770
so mister 12:26 was

534
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:54,179
was upstairs mindlessly typing whereas
email and

535
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,929
his manager knocked on the door unless
there's a little debate about the

536
00:31:57,929 --> 00:31:59,399
exchange here

537
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:02,529
the guy coming at the door swears he
heard come in

538
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:05,590
so he did

539
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,610
beep done this is from never seeing

540
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,820
his key ever touched it never had it

541
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,240
I did have to gas at guess at the guest
I D

542
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,000
and as it turned out ice cream later
that day

543
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,490
because he left my key I made in the
power button

544
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:29,389
power Slot and went downstairs with his
key that is now invalid

545
00:32:29,389 --> 00:32:32,850
so he gets down stairs and he comes back
up won't work

546
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,289
goes down to the desk became a new key

547
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:39,299
and it turns out so sector 8

548
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:43,480
is where the arm with Ricky what's

549
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,679
alright and hotel desk recoded is key

550
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,899
and added sector 10 with key

551
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:54,710
all zeros so the theory is this actually
resets

552
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,820
you guessed it: clock

553
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:01,369
at first we thought it was a master key
but and that would have been just two

554
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:02,059
lucky

555
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:06,159
arm so yeah on so I just upgraded his

556
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,220
previous key so they both have the same
SAT overall good

557
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:15,850
on alright so unfortunately for Larry
Hughes 1k keys

558
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:19,270
arm john was able to reverse-engineer
heartbeat

559
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:22,529
I now john has his own promotion on

560
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:26,279
purchase one meal John's restaurant and
get a free starter larry's

561
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:31,679
just crank these cards out it's no
problem arm

562
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,149
packed so what do you think you'll
notice with

563
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:39,220
I and that's the stuff is they've all
got the at that and a collision ID

564
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:43,210
so when multiple devices show up in the
field out at the same time

565
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:46,369
but the device can discern which one
wants to talk to you

566
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:50,399
arm be very careful here on the my first
series

567
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,230
the manufacturer has already announced
they've rolled over keys

568
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,520
sorry don't use the anti-collision code

569
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,610
for any form security one it's possible
to get another card

570
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,730
to it's possible to clone it with the
device and just emulated

571
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:09,149
and three it's actually surprisingly
easy to call China and get a card

572
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:12,980
that looks and feels exactly like my
fair but ignores the requirements about

573
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,409
not writing over the UNT

574
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:22,389
arm yes the knock off cards are easy to
easy to get your hands out he's a clown

575
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:25,839
you'd be surprised how many businesses
use just that you I D as

576
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,710
a token to get the get you in the front
door

577
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,139
I won't mention one that's near and dear
to my heart

578
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:37,440
I to me I am

579
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,149
alright sorry if you're ever in the wild
I'm you know Mike

580
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:44,210
my basic rule is if you wouldn't like
the tag

581
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,230
if you don't know where it's been I use
an app to scan it

582
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:50,260
arm and find out what's on it before his
cat

583
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,700
I mean I know I know the whole idea of
NFC is to make it fast and easy to just

584
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,290
gonna be

585
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:57,440
and you've got whatever it is they're
selling arm

586
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,000
unless you know for a fact what they're
selling

587
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,720
I'm not sure I trusted on your never
trust a 14-8 use for anything

588
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,069
arm the deaths fire the Falcons are are
generally fine right now

589
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:14,330
and never trust the UNT for anything

590
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:19,589
and you know except on except at this
point in the case of elkind as far

591
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:22,740
don't trust don't trust cards for sure
value arm

592
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,859
unless you're talking about french fries
in

593
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:28,930
something simple

594
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:31,930
and apparently I've had too much
caffeine cuz

595
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:38,930
I blew right thru any questions

596
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:02,000
just one small question: is my for the
only 48 implementation or is there

597
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,030
any other input module I topaz is also a

598
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,660
and yes to both the NXP's are the

599
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,940
XP to you one and the annex B type

600
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,099
your type 5 are all fourteen-day

601
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:19,480
but they are not affected by the attacks
that to affect my for

602
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,790
my for classic on v

603
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:27,549
the Topaz and V type the type 1 and type
2 used own have back you structure

604
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:30,819
they don't claim to be that secure in
the first place so

605
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:33,859
they're not affected because that offer

606
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:40,859
thank you

607
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,250
here

608
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:55,400
you mentioned that the hotel card sector
what's

609
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,650
bankrupted for serve encrypt I was used

610
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,060
it was protected by a key encrypt it was
wrong that's my bad

611
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,470
arm so in the my fair exchange

612
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:09,280
when you start up you have to you no I
get in one case

613
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,750
you have to address the sector and say I
want to keep your psyche

614
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,490
I and if you authenticate correctly you
get good data

615
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:19,510
if you if you don't you get bogus bogus
junk

616
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:23,750
arm its there is a little bit of

617
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,940
alleged cryptography going on between
them that's one the reasons it's so easy

618
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,630
to break

619
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:32,619
arm the attack against it is actually
very simple side-channel

620
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:37,390
are every eggs every four or five failed
attempts

621
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,890
it sends back and Mac with what appears
to be random junk if you pay enough

622
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,180
attention to it and know what the key is

623
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,240
you can kind of workout the pattern and
that and that's how

624
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,020
that's how the it's called the it's got
a nested

625
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:54,510
attack that's how that works arm it does
require having one key

626
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,840
but you know on the card out there is
another tact that use a similar methods

627
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,720
that doesn't require

628
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:04,710
any keys you don't have to know anything
about the card get to get one key back

629
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:11,710
thanks

630
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,010
am bottom

631
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:24,040
out payment cards credit cards I E
understand that it's also planned to

632
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,480
equip does with them

633
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,690
NFC I ology I yeah well

634
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:32,390
alright it's not pure idiocy it's not
your trademark and see because it

635
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,240
doesn't use doesn't change and I'm

636
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,410
arm those are mostly using the test Park
Arts

637
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:41,120
arm and one on the extension options for
Dez fire is where you can

638
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,800
essentially in bed a sim ship in there
with all the

639
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,550
you pick up to standards that come with
that on so the idea is it actually

640
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,840
generates a unique number every time you
read it

641
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,780
arm so the ideas are based on time and
everything else

642
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,610
on in theory those are hard to duplicate
image as you can get you can read the

643
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,880
number one point in time

644
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,170
but if you don't use it right away arm

645
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:10,170
it won't be valid but any other

646
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:15,950
on

647
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:19,319
I I recently heard about and
implementation from

648
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:23,680
I think you'll be key yes that was doing
that is that was announcing

649
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,839
on Yukito gon WEA NFC to be used as a
second factors

650
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:32,470
for syndication can you imagine that
something like that

651
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:37,079
after what you said here can be secure I

652
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:40,079
I'd actually played without
implementation a little better a friend

653
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,380
a man in the audience has one

654
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,990
arm and what I haven't gone into great
detail

655
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:49,599
but arm is actually using type 1 and its
generating unit nito can every time you

656
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,109
scan it

657
00:39:50,109 --> 00:39:54,309
arm so the assumption is there's you
there some kind of RTC going on in there

658
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:54,839
are

659
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:58,240
at we've tried cloning you try read

660
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:04,000
and then use that token and haven't been
able to successfully get it to work

661
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,160
so arm I also should note that it's not

662
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,089
the on the NSC is actually

663
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:16,299
in Napier on built into the chip it's
not a standard tag

664
00:40:16,299 --> 00:40:20,400
on sorry I arm

665
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,680
from what I've seen it's pretty good
implementation I haven't

666
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,240
haven't actually tried to tear apart yet
but it's it's pretty simple where it's

667
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:27,880
at passing

668
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:34,880
nope a token should only be valid for
certain period of time

669
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:45,349
else

670
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:45,599
are
