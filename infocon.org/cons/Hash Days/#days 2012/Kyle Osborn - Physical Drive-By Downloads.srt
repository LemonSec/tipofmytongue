18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,580
it's fun %ah okay

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,800
so jump right into it I am Android user
ecosystem

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,000
on and I yet so

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,130
I basically there's a huge focus

22
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,360
on sucking on it's pretty much like hey
I'm gonna make myself as

23
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,390
in secure as possible let's do it

24
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,479
aren't so this big focus on rooting
phones I mean

25
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,299
everybody wants to have a root on their
phone Drake you can do fun stuff you can

26
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:34,680
install app so you can customize said
you can

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,680
in the US we have our own I

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,030
the carriers ISPR nice piece a cellular
carriers don't like

29
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,479
let you to Heather without paying an
extra money which is

30
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,750
ridiculous like a an extra thirty US
dollars just to

31
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,439
tether your phone to and I gotta start
stop excelling

32
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,600
I actually 30 bucks to tether your phone

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,040
to your laptop so you can use your
phone's internet like its ridiculous

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,579
fees

35
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:01,710
our but when you get root you just like

36
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,960
but them I can't either all I want no
big deal so

37
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,950
a lot of people together I as a lot of
untested wrong so there are a lot of

38
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,459
people running around and being like a
look

39
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,970
sign in my school like you know summit
but tons of stuff inside edge Mon and

40
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,100
does but she things

41
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,290
ok by the way here Z unofficial poor
assign engine mods you know install

42
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,830
on your random phone that nobody's ever
heard of I

43
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,680
a lot of ATK's being passed around so
it's a case are basically the

44
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,620
Android package files for I for
applications

45
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,849
I so in the again the US we have a

46
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:39,250
Verizon who sucks and they don't like

47
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,520
Google Wallet which I know you guys I
have the wallets of you guys but

48
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,780
I love you all being in the US are I

49
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,750
so rising basically says you can have
the wallet because of some sort of

50
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,150
yes insecurity thing when Rio and

51
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,260
group when reality they just don't want
you having

52
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,769
specific applications because they know
either one

53
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:03,819
you know you can tether with them or to
I they have a better product

54
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:08,470
I'm sorry better product to give you
survey praying you from using it so much

55
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,890
people are like oh yeah here's the

56
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,330
unofficial version of Google Wallet and

57
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:18,310
a crew a its an official who the hell
knows

58
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,900
you know what's in there %ah and you
know if the cases are signed

59
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,629
by the developer you can you sign him to
install them and then when you install

60
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:29,379
them it's all like oh yeah by the way
hey this is an

61
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:32,409
on you actually to go into settings and
allow

62
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:35,760
arm I set a policy to allow

63
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,080
arm packages to be inside cyber in and

64
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,090
a bit nobody out nobody knows how to
verify

65
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,260
that they are signed by the de ver
developer and it's just had security

66
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,970
events like

67
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,220
for all your about security we all

68
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,620
%ah action again that a little bit with
C and read but I am

69
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,099
your she security efforts I

70
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,840
are I did a little poll I I who will
serve a

71
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,230
only five years is a sound are but
others 500 users and

72
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,280
the services of read it I'm sure some
you guys know read it I

73
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,250
they were about 500 users that and
service on the subreddit

74
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,880
Android a for Android separate and
seventy percent in the morning rooted

75
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,210
cuz everybody loves being routed I 50s

76
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:28,050
six-person had ATV enable many be is
were basically gonna

77
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,800
rate a TV today on ATB is the

78
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,590
and reading by bridge it's pretty much
are so many you are too cool things and

79
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,889
you know it's also pretty shitty cuz it
makes you super insecure

80
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:45,389
I seventy six don't discuss disable a
custom ROM so

81
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:48,990
thats arms are disc custom recovery so
that's a a

82
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,130
clockworkmod or TWRP year that's
anything that you use to review found a

83
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,000
flash

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,240
stuff and then I you know 18 almost neck
ninety percent don't use encryption

85
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,750
like who does that how you not use
encryption but

86
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,320
you know handwritten support encryption
till like three point to you and then

87
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,060
for our own

88
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,160
a bunch people are still stuck on 2.3
that

89
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,720
kinda sucks I forty-one percent

90
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,650
you slide on lock so that is a pass for
you just group your phone's open

91
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:23,440
no big deal I and then %uh those to %uh
vs surveyed twenty to use the gesture

92
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,270
marc

93
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,160
and a you know the judge you think it's
all i care this is an iPhone so in order

94
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,940
for second

95
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,680
there are like a lucky you a swipe your
fingers like this so often do the same

96
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,479
thing now your phones unlocked

97
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:38,479
I and then its forty-percent

98
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,050
used some sort of security software anti
virus or

99
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,350
remote tracking wiping whatever arm so
it's

100
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,120
conduct our own survey who has every
year

101
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,520
Anza okay is as much better I was in Nam

102

103
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,919
on but only three people in the audience
at the site had Android

104
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,310
and that should give you an idea of what
type of converts was

105
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,610
arm anyway so love those people that
have Android

I should wanted to say all that now

117
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:58,360
I real quick process I entered security
so you know they're like

118
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,090
browser exploits a application exploits

119
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,880
are there were a few colonel exploits I
member dipper is one the exploits at

120
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,349
have-we affected a lot about phones

124
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,750
a Vaquero version and you're like shit
number different works as its in C

125
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,280
route it's great are ATB exploits so
race conditions or or whatever

126
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,530
else and then of course there exploits

127
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,020
created by vendors I so or a little bit
ago

128
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,110
arm Samsung decided that they were gonna
install kies

129
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,530
which is there phone management want to
watch people's phones or something like

130
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,530
that and

131
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:48,099
it created a route exploit so was no
useful for users I guess but

132
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:52,240
and made them super and secure with
kinda sucks yes

133

account so we're actually gonna do this

154
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,470
with

155
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,600
my real account which sucks an airy

156
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,060
I okay so of we're going to talk about
it the doc is physical drive-by

157
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,440
downloads or gonna talk a little bit of
physical access to a revised

158
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,209
everybody knows you access a laptop you
guys know what to do

159
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:26,500
with the a laptop like when you get a
laptop or computer in your physical

160
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,649
access

161
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:32,959
you booed up something to either crack
the password for Windows or change the

162
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,100
password a Windows you use some sort

163
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,930
love a recovery software you some
forensic stuff you Paul sensor

164
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,620
information of

165
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,420
we're gonna talk a little bit about that
with Android on

166
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,060
yea so a the secure boot loader are so
basically

167
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,870
I'm as you all know your bootloader is
its kinda makes sense

168
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,430
you know it load shit and it starts at
Boone

169
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,000
on the secure Brewers basically on
Android phones

170
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,680
when you have a secure beware that
basically means a oh yeah you can't boot

171
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,490
anything that

172
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,550
isn't signed by whoever

173
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:13,959
right arm and you have a stock recovery
partition so

174
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:17,360
the the recovery partition is basically
used and we'll go over this

175
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,430
recovery partition is basically use for
encrypting things are

176
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,649
over the years updates or whatever and
buy stock

177
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:27,209
it it just if you don't change it it's
pretty secure like there's not a whole

178
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,040
lot of

179
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
things you can do with it when it's a
stop to order just

180
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,740
doesn't do anything arms I soccer
coverage doesn't do anything

181
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,089
from have course I'm leader you're a
trip you know encryption prevents

182
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:42,450
access to the doin its you know call
booted

183
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,930
by Chiara Chiara is basically the
interface that you see when you

184
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,220
you know have your pin number or pin or
password or gesture marc

185
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,529
on and then ATV and a beast on really
got a kind ever

186
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,610
you know kick a little bit because we
like em I

187
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:03,680
up so all those things work together
encryption and stock partition

188
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,500
bootloader whatever arm you know one of
those failures basically means that

189
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,500
your shits own i7

190
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,720
secular not all devices have a lot
cooler

191
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,019
on real quick I on three problem

192
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:21,649
guys probably didn't get that you guys
know each be touchpad

193
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:25,430
Marin HP was all like oh we have a
tablet and we're cool now

194
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,630
in in they saw so they just fire sale
all their talents for really really

195
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,519
cheap

196
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:34,930
and they discontinue Web OS did any view
grab one of those tablets

197
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:38,579
the HP TouchPad and XO

198
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:43,519
arm so I grabbed if like to have them
and I sold one are straight one from

199
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,260
iPad or something arm had 10 for a while
I sit still

200
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,350
kinda play with delivery once in a while
but the HP TouchPad

201
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,100
does not have a secure border that means
that

202
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,170
I can plug into the USB reboot the
device and be like

203
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,300
okay run this in Iran FS

204
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,850
plus this kernel and it's like yeah no
problem all run this

205
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,920
you know who the hell you on I don't
really care there's no authentication

206
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,339
all just go ahead and run this crawl for
you

207
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:16,079
no problem the its readers but does not
have a secure do our which

208
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,990
means that I will never ever use it as a
regular tablet because I will never

209
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,980
stick my stuff on there because

210
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,160
that shits in securing like our now a
cycle

211
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,620
are so some Googlers commute unlocked
like I the Galaxy Nexus so

212
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,079
the Galaxy Nexus can be unlocked in just
a a a few seconds

213
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:37,750
on your thing about that is that once a
Galaxy Nexus unlocked it wipes the

214
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,240
by the the partition so writes the data
partition immediately so

215
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,860
even if it is accessed getting me the
way I saw your data when someone tries

216
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,320
on market

217
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,589
however like the HP TouchPad is on
secure an

218
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:54,029
there are other devices which don't have
you immediate lock

219
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:59,610
are any immediate wipe and in all those
factors for being called bring whatever

220
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,899
I like I said recovery partition you
know for

221
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:06,829
encryption and applying over-the-air
updates and whatever system and shit

222
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:09,850
arm encryption I

223
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,370
again rebooting tax your shit because on
gifted

224
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,910
no big deal on it does however use the
keyguard

225
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,959
pain and pass and

226
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:23,380
cue card allows for like four-digit pin
no a pen

227
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,820
and you know really small password also
so

228
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,019
you could conceivably track it pretty
easily

229
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:33,079
you know see me that they have a small
passer

230
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:37,220
a so this is a key art it's the whole
gesture thing it prevents immediate

231
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,209
access it

232
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:41,310
you know Face Unlock yes is

233
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,829
anybody here use face unlock on Android

234
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:50,240
did you guys see in 4.1 or as the co
Samsung whatever introduced at work you

235
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,420
had to blink

236
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,560
they're all like are yet to print
circular access or whatever and

237
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,699
you have to see your point a picture at
it you actually have to bring

238
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:01,769
a few times so it knows that

239
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:05,529
you're actually not a static picture a
some guy got smart

240
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:08,930
and has a like okay well import my photo
to

241
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,730
Microsoft Paint on it take some on my
skin from my face

242
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:18,190
that i'm gonna put it over my eyes and
then I'm gonna go back and forth between

243
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,100
the pictures so it looks like I'm
looking

244
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,810
and that unlocks face-off harkin it

245
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,410
yet its it's just a novelty doesn't
where

246
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:31,199
at like I said earlier pattern smudges
CIA

247
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,920
outlook on your alter phone nobody on I
know we password and has allowed

248
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,500
a the so if you do the gesture of their
about 390,000

249
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,320
a possible gestures by you know they're

250
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,100
are nine different points on it I real
quick I came to that because

251
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,120
okay so you can't do you i cant any two
ways are pointers

252
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,050
I C you can't do 123 unless you go
through to first-rate

253
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,470
in less you go to 13 to

254
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,790
it was really easy to get a lot of that
stuff out and you can't repeat numbers

255
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,060
so

256
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,000
basically when is it limited to three in
ninety thousand

257
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,149
and 390,000 seems like a lot but we're
gonna

258
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:16,570
talk about in the second and it start
the hash in

259
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,820
read-only or route readable file

260
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,130
only arson system user which you can't
generally access

261
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:28,300
AB of doesn't provide USB debugging te
connecter in forever

262
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,779
physical factors to order on lock code

263
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:35,110
non stock recovery partition on a reboot
your phone into recovery

264
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,570
and then I'm a star stealing stuff up
there because it's non-stock and it

265
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,750
isn't secure I like I've encryption you
know

266
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,889
whatever he been able you pretty much
win everything

267
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:49,130
right so it's not all about the phone
you know the phone is great what a day

268
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:49,740
to

269
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,420
passwords text messages photos emails
whatever on

270
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,889
it's not the best but we really want
your Google account and I mentioned

271
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,120
before we're gonna

272
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,740
still everything I have care of this

273
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,250
unlock the water white phone whatever
may wipe the phone requires a reboot

274
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,290
it slow it takes a few seconds where arm

275
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,300
if it's already unlocked great you know
uses rebooted

276
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,310
you're set arm sitting with custom
recovery if your custom recovery

277
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,139
just rebooted you're set you to start
stealing stuff I love it

278
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:25,320
video I somewhat I really care about

279
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,199
is being really really fast like I

280
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,380
art I'll I don't know anything about
last night because I remember anything

281
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,410
my last night

282
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,410
however if any have you remember last
name

283
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,620
are and any if you haven't left your bar

284
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,800
sitting at the table or left your bar
sitting at

285
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,790
Arts I les you left your phone sitting
at a bar left your phone sitting in a

286
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,690
bar

287
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,740
I accidentally maneuvering back Michael
shit I should

288
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,870
like secure you know put this in my
pocket so no one

289
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,269
starts looking through my ASI photos or
something

290
00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:00,820
basically I want that like I won't be
sitting at a bar

291
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,899
I want someone to walk away I just wanna
be with

292
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:07,120
plug something in their phone and be
like who

293
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,800
now I own everything right arm

294
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,849
and that's where this thing comes as so
USB

295
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:17,280
OG it's a USB on-the-go cable on

296
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,299
and this basically is it turns your
phone into USB host

297
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:24,480
which is awesome because now I can plug
things into it and its functional

298
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,860
as some sort of post device

299
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,160
but you know this this will cables
awesome

300
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,890
but it requires another cable on it that
sucks so on

301
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,900
have they the guys I have five if you
don't know how five their arm

302
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,220
ago video security hacker podcasting

303
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,960
arm you know they've got a lotta silly
stuff on there but

304
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,140
they were kind enough to make me this a

305
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,330
so this look a beret here is actually a

306
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,970
host motor filth into the cable to USB

307
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:02,169
on nickerson mentioned that said a stock
yesterday any caller crossover tape

308
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:02,890
cable

309
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,429
that's actually pretty much what it is
slates v

310
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:10,039
it's so simple make a this thing cost
about

311
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:13,940
70 cents on Amazon any in the US is as
cheap as hell like it's less than a

312
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,780
dollar

313
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,660
on this thing same sort of thing like we
ordered them from China

314
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,679
I like 70 cents a cable that they just
easy it's just a few wires crossed over

315
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,910
and the pains are different or something

316
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,799
now with you this is awesome is now

317
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:33,890
I can just pretty much be like we at one
time at the bar

318
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,190
I want to bring my laptop to the markets
do this right

319
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,309
as by I how it is here but

320
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:45,660
if you brought your bar arms a few for
your laptop to the bar or a club

321
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,350
people would be a little weirded out by
it probably won't sit next to you not

322
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,850
because they thought you were

323
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,850
are ya gonna hacked them they will
probably just be like

324
00:18:54,850 --> 00:19:01,850
skies fuckin weird I wanna be next to
this guy he's got his laptop at a bar

325
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,600
I'll that's what this cable facilitates
right we want to be able to walk up

326
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,520
to someone at a bar with a mile without
your laptop it would have you

327
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,290
group and driving on their so

328
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,340
that's where up p2p

329
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,690
phone to phone AB comes in %uh some
engine eighty year and that's basically

330
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,230
and ready by bridge and that

331
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,680
allows you a lot of access device I am

332
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,190
and I bill I calling it a framework

333
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,060
both a framework that basically runs on
your phone

334
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,260
it right now senator milan is actually a
queueing I am

335
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,950
where you just plug in someone's phone
you run a few commands you like to look

336
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,420
at that

337
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,980
our steel all your camera photos who no

342
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,410
I still camera photos steel the Google

343
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:13,300
authentication tokens I steel WPA
supplicant

344
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,540
a doc on them in VPN keys and other
stuff and

345
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:23,240
a bit you know WPA supplicant stores all
over wifi passers in clear text zone

346
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,000
now you can hop on their wifi and
continue their own other things on there

347
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,460
there's device are you can completely
disable key guard

348
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,220
which is really easy in the it the
Android AP I'm super nice

349
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,180
its three lines echoed so like oh yeah
I'm declaring the

350
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:42,460
keyguard on what class I'm initiating
the class

351
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,510
please unlocked the the screen for me

352
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,790
nobody of three mind the code on and
then you install custom

353
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,240
AB gays and you could do and

354
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,080
actually done this that's a lie a
haven't done that but basically auto

355
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,100
configure proxies are you being on the
phone

356
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,410
someone pp yes it's me iight are

357
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:06,720
so about the text through on typists

358
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,640
af dissolve I reinstalled some are rude
stuff

359
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,100
I so basically I from my phone

360
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,680
I can ru a few other phones and there's
no

361
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,180
to in the nose or brush and the other
one member dipper

362
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,670
it's all just you know runs on Linux and
they're all just

363
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,500
shell shit are ever so is no reason I
can't cross compile them to my phone or

364
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,080
whatever and

365
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,240
get all working so your walk around with
the phone that roots other phones

366
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,270
so even if they had he been able there's
something or

367
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:40,370
me you know you in a way before then you
have roots so you have a limited access

368
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,390
you just plug it in to be like a look at
that your phone is rooted now

369
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:48,560
which means that I have read on your
phone it's awesome our

370
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,040
cracks the gesture pattern so on you
know the gestion pattern like images

371
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,030
only 390,000

372
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:59,680
options while for and 390,000

373
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,300
lines in a file along with their hash
only twenty make your life I'll

374
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:09,050
so I just like a sec calculated all the
potential gestures and I just

375
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,260
may be equally ashes on them so you
actually at the crack anything you just

376
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,840
grab the file for those frat hash and
then responds with the

377
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,350
the code I am and then

378
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:24,610
I would like to make it a I'm organism

379
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,710
crazy as hell om again engine that a

380
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:31,520
eventual formation sites want you to be
even like you know

381
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,280
before you plug into a phone be like oh
yeah I want you to

382
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,410
steal the Google Data root there for our

383
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:41,530
worry their phones your Google Data the
the

384
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,280
payload their phones I want your you
know it's all rooted or whatever and

385
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,830
that's good

386
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,520
and then you know when I plug then it'll
be like only look I detected a phone

387
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,050
summer do all these things now with a
knee surgery he's already

388
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:55,850
interaction down fun %ah

389
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,610
so I made an app called anti guards so

390
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:04,020
keyguard anti guard right and seculow
name

391
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,430
arm installs basically the

392
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,730
you plug it in and installs and it
unlocks the phone fucking awesome

393
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,940
arm like I said its that

394
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,450
three lines of code which the and Reiki
I is all I

395
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:20,890
ok this is a good idea have installed so
we can disable the screen

396
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:24,070
block for you I and it has a few local

397
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,200
on where arm Ste a be enabled

398
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,860
you're fucked like no big deal like if
you

399
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,970
if you ever left your phone if your
phone is ever lost you know

400
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,070
when I have your say while you're eighty
be enabled you should just

401
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,710
change all your passwords and consider
yourself screwed because

402
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,510
potentially this could have happened on

403
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:49,510
alright I don't really care about this
stuff I just want you to demos

404
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:53,170
or on way faster now I'm sorry

405
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:57,570
really what it is I is I'm really
hungover or drunk still size 12

406
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:01,490
this on way when

407
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,550
II so AB enable is so when a TV enable

408
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:09,720
EB is enabled and okay so I you know a
lot of I i get some flak from people

409
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,040
going I am you know we won't

410
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,740
no who runs around with eighty be
enabled on their phone right

411
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,200
so good developer thing like most people
that do that well

412
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,290
pre-match anybody that as ever install
the custom ROM has an able

413
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,580
anybody at the developer has enabled
I'll

414
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,020
and a lot of people out in a broad range

415
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,150
%uh and in reality I wanna you

416
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,480
I want to target those people like I
wanna be like okay

417
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,060
you're a tech guy your also the a

418
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,290
tech guy at this company that I wanna
own

419
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:47,670
summer follow you to the bar and then

420
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:51,800
I'm gonna own your phone at the bar by
when you're not watching

421
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,090
has so basically grab all the things on

422
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,170
would applications shit so browser
passwords whatever SMS

423
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,950
wifi password system hash whatever

424
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,480
on and then you know it's all good and
oh yeah

425
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,580
sink Google account

426
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:15,360
II so again EV no root so sometimes you
have a TV in it ATB enable but you don't

427
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,100
have a real

428
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,760
or in some some instances a when you try
to gain root

429
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,840
it all prompt you so for people

430
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,640
have rooted with their Android phones I
you've probably use the application

431
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,780
superuser dodi BK or super soon got a
big game

432
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,790
basically what that does is it prompts
you to grant ru

433
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:38,580
to the the application is running it so
there is some sort of authentication

434
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:44,330
there that I am you know prevent ran an
absolute getting root access

435
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:48,880
so sometimes you're a the phone will be
like oh hey look you tryna request ru

436
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,530
Paul

437
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:54,260
on a popup this little thinkin you know
you have the proper what the key

438
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,100
the safety car is enabled if if the
phone is locked you can't

439
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,320
you know grant access to Route so thing
in our room you cancel ATK's

440
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,040
and if you can't sleep UK's you can
force unlock the screen

441
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,960
to you for so long the screen and you go
yes fees grant you permission to my

442

494
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:55,020

515
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,350
kinda stuff right there whatever I am

516
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:29,200
and we have my app

517
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,470
Rania its

518
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:36,990
ago this is Peter Beeb

519
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,549
an it's just a buncha shell scripts like
at serious its

520
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:43,549
the only binaries I included arm

521
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:46,750
are a few things to just make some

522
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:51,020
people happy because some people then be
the prerequisites so I just

523
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:54,679
threw in a few binary so I would stop
getting emails from people saying

524
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,549
I can't run this why can't I run this in
and I

525
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,890
%uh so first of all I wanna prerequisite
things was

526
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:05,409
arm so this you start work against stock

527
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:09,270
devices because other some stupid BS
with

528
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:13,049
pp are with ATV prevents you from doing
a few things

529
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:16,779
so basically I I threw a busy box

530
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:19,950
onto the device and busybox isn't like a

531
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:23,220
talk it up just like core utilities
whatever and

532
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,970
I need some that safer on busy boss is
great and since

533
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:32,179
up my device is rooted it goes I'll
check that out where ru

534
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:35,529
this awesome like hell yeah is great

535
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:38,770
so up what you want to do hey on him

536
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:42,500
again are going to check will recheck
you for ruining sewing

537
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,080
or yet %uh so not natively ru will
continue escalating privileges with the

538
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,929
sioux binary

539
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:52,110
that's awesome arm and

540
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:55,860
you know devices don't have real be like
oh yeah you know limited functionally

541
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,760
whatever that sucks

542
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,899

the hash file against a file that I have

608
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:54,460
and it's all like or yeah by the way
here's your unlock code

609
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,599
so the unlock code I'm sorry user just
about it the

610
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,099
the unlock adjust your parents is
insulted on

611
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:06,109
the all this stuff you know the the pain
and the password

612
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:09,930
arse or they have assault so it's you
know it's and it's really big it's like

613
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:10,580
a

614
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:14,420
8 eight bytes or something so that makes
it free infeasible

615
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,170
even if they have a a pretty small are
exited the facts

616
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:21,800
yet pretty infeasible even if they have
a small password arm

617
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,190
to generate you know allister remote a
border and that's why we have salts

618
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,589
arm but the gesture pattern Sherman they
were right now

619
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:32,859
because shit school hmm

620
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:36,910
and I got a disabled after want one of
my I'll my own things on my show you

621
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,230
some mitigation tactics and all that is

622
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:42,580
I always forget to

623
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:46,349
what encryption Poor's I was have got

624
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:49,720
from clustering could do this or
something arm

625
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,640
mmm wanna the I am the medication
examine issues

626
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,980
on out like just you know I i forget to
disable a TV all the time

627
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:01,460
is always doing and Richard uses I it's
like a security

628
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:05,339
our research platform it for me and its
arm

629
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:09,670
his water Nuss fun all around are you so
much I do

630
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:13,560
development on it so I always forget to
disable Abul

631
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,390
again AB's hard to remember disable
right

632
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,930
10

633
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:25,190
right so I just enable the gesture
pattern

634
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:30,080
I don't even what is it however now I
wasn't paying attention when I made it

635
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,540
so we're just gonna be IIIA get the
gesture pattern pwease

636
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,760
I'll look at that gestion patter is

637
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,040
0 0 0

638
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,540
12 4678 how that's a hard question
better

639
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:48,260
you know you can never cracked back
that's like really long range

640
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,810
now are 0 one to you

641
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:55,330
for 6 7

642
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,420
a only that issue just better

643
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,640
really easy yeah it's

644
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,720
its I A its its

645
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,720
can a stupid relates I don't know why
they don't solve it like the

646
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,980
a pass or in the pan like it seems like
that would be

647
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,500
a smart thing to do but they just throw
the sha-1

648
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,369
hash into a file without any cell call
good

649
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:25,000
its I'm not sure why

650
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,150
