1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,270
exposed

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,580
say yes our point supra well thank

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,080
nice I'm a month

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,740
an influx

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,350
today so

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,980
but without to me I'm talking to you
about I guess I guess that's the a

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,500
my name's on finance some humane on
these fanatics on a researcher for comic

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,520
of activity

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,630
I'm on if you wanna get hold me on
Twitter or LinkedIn or anything like Rob

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,619
as the links

11
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,720
I if you have any questions and then you
know i Austin during the talk whatever

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,940
if not drop us an email

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:43,989
I'll get back to you at some point I'll
try anywhere

14
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:47,399
so the source stuff that I wanna come to
share with you today

15
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,629
so that the walkways from today is I'm
why test idsi CAS

16
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:56,070
was quite obvious cuz its part your
infrastructure that's on everyone's

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,929
networks

18
00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:00,170
your we don't really do anything with it
I'll

19
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,170
make this disclaimer before star Nov and
i dont

20
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,380
cell IPS products are don't expect cells
pic

21
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,580
I'm care another strange things went ok
so I D S II LTE is a sales pitch come

22
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:11,980
and

23
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,470
no of was a good test but more
importantly was about test

24
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,960
i'm having a look where it got there was
easy to testimony isn't

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,750
talking about testing methodology for i
guess i ts

26
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,780
I'm on the fact that the reason actually
mom which is a bit sake

27
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,369
I am on a way forward I'm

28
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:40,250
what basically the ocean projects aims
of sorry when you talk about that action

29
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,469
what you if we talk about I guess you
really need to kinda lay out what

30
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:48,240
intrusion detection is not include my
eyes as you need to work out

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,700
as an organization what detection means
for them

32
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,740
I'm sure we all know organizations step
purchase IPS

33
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,600
because they're required purchase
purchases not very interested in it is

34
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,409
hoped that the

35
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,409
action or anything like that I'm and
that's cool

36
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,740
non same about wrong I am but as an
organizational priorities

37
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,100
different because you know and to get
action detection few

38
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,100
means making sure you're complying and
I'm

39
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,430
personally I think assessing our kisses
is a productive

40
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,510
exercise because it kinda much is

41
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,670
like expectations realities and we only
see without fails I'll

42
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,810
I've got some more stores along the way
tell you where they

43
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:36,210
like I guess have gone into place the
oksana didn't know how it works properly

44
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,390
called back eighteen months later now
detected everything

45
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,610
has been configured wrong with the on
the stock technology

46
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,850
repurchased but you know you out but
I'll so many stores

47
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,240
so understanding detection systems well

48
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,390
it's when you want when you got this and
you expected

49
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,370
top I'm you know is small for the cop

50
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,990
got doc I'm but rarely

51
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,870
basically you could define intrusion
detection

52
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,270
only certainly network intrusion
detection some talk about not talking

53
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,980
about a host of running like today

54
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,610
I'm it's basically network
infrastructure that monitors the traffic

55
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,450
the signs that malicious behavior I'm
and I the ass

56
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,020
is a Pasig member Matlack an an IPS is
an active member

57
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,910
go time and you probably already realize
this always

58
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:36,000
well fails open because it costs doesn't
have anything going through

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,010
I think Bergeron's or spenders like to
see them

60
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,390
i guess its cash accounts I'm and the
reason being is

61
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,490
gonna 2010 reported

62
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,330
that the stunned to learn I cast market
was worth $900 89 million

63
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,350
fast response time to learn IPS

64
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:59,110
nearly a billion but I'm some sort of
context 2010 is beginning a bit like

65
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,820
that the financial crisis to European
countries get bill

66
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,870
at bailed-out not tired america is
having a huge financial issues

67
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,230
I and in 2000 time companies brought

68
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:17,230
nearly a billion dollars worth of Ikea
AC Milan's West $999 million

69
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,419
and course in 2010 the Federal 999

70
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:25,490
I agency tap proving one thing

71
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,800
that I am yeah I guess AC Milan

72
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,129
agency that bring one thing fools and
money a scene separate

73
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:36,699
and I'm I haven't so

74
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:40,530
ready when we talk by DS its top box

75
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,870
stop flushing box on your network that
you can tell me anything about

76
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,620
you know how do you know when I guess is
working lights blinking

77
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,370
cool I'm the one about and the told you
will protect you against everything

78
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,620
matters era PA there's I'm

79
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,909
it was a fantastic in Vegas couple years
ago the house I know

80
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:03,500
during like Moxham on Spike let's just
break the whole SSL

81
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,610
I'm and a hot on their that it'll sell

82
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,680
for they protect you against on moxie

83
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,680
talks to come give you a rough idea the
band

84
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,830
speak though they use but yeah

85
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,039
is the one that protects against 30 days
no stops but it's not you

86
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,129
concha me at the texan for

87
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:25,520
an example how they work is that simple
and short on just teach you how

88
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,520
so cats at this moment we would save you
character of life

89
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,650
over the slides ago too quickly stopped
me and asked me a question

90
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,960
its is about his basic stuff right now
but this is basically

91
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,729
how the texan works practically

92
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:44,569
I'm SO 867 personal conference my summer
so its acceptance made an appearance

93
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:48,870
I am but so you look for a
accountability

94
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,749
worms looking for viability say and I
saw 867

95
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:59,539
connecting to an SMB server detection
system sees this much this is not ban

96
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:03,370
looks for the event sees it as a threat
in that generates the alert

97
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,680
that aren't we save the internet from
the bad guys

98
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,349
that's how it's supposed to work the
reality is is the real purpose is to

99
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:12,340
analyze advance

100
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,310
respond to them that's what it do
thereabouts all about balance

101
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,249
and kinda sounds like my pic but it's
far from it

102
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:25,279
its basic logic basic whatever itsu ka
of

103
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,310
IPS the form I never is

104
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,090
is that it signature-based about what
they say

105
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,099
there's a logic K that says if

106
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:38,770
but think happens here do this

107
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,779
I that has to be expressed in some way
shape or form you can

108
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:45,419
we can talk about Nami detection
software for but

109
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,439
and the and the based on some that's
cool to see idea of work on intrusion

110
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:50,789
detection framework these components

111
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:55,180
than I cashed or idea Chicago it's like
1970 at the very least

112
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,840
stuff when you think that the IPS
industry I think 1972 is like first

113
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,659
commercial point

114
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:04,689
I guess is so really stop

115
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:07,740
and we saw for a long time you have made
things any back to

116
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,590
but and treason we have four components

117
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,800
event spokesman Alex box storage box for
comics books

118
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,270
we've pretty much work out what's going
on here but even in IITs

119
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,349
say he's an excellent idea this was
possible how can I have countermeasures

120
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:26,409
sending a look out for the count knots

121
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:30,800
thats compartments when you're talking
about like abating I guess the taxable

122
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,240
year old to be trying to subvert the box
will be a box many olive Asian

123
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
techniques

124
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,770
I try and make through all that and a
bag doesn't happen

125
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:43,210
when if in fact does happen that doesn't
get analyzes the threat

126
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,240
so and I guess when you try to evade you
really tryna get past these two things

127
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,900
you could

128
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,210
how the talks here you know exposes the
just about

129
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,439
I thought by taking account matches box
out so you can the

130
00:07:54,439 --> 00:08:00,939
administrator this something about a
book i've seen. I think practical

131
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:06,169
today's first cunt got cannot situations
that threats need to be fully understood

132
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:09,499
I'm and thats a lot easier to accept
them don't

133
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:13,569
on city affects me to have contacts

134
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:18,770
mean the mean something and if you write
simple room

135
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,509
that patches like your C code I'm sure
because you can't touch this in the

136
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:23,930
audience in you

137
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,059
find up on a billion the web OPP you

138
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:31,029
go to the client's Hey look may go OK in
the developed because of me

139
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:34,130
touches the PRC code K retest

140
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,669
refine no problem still that rewrite of
the OC code are

141
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:44,740
get we've got a cam this happens and I D
S all the time

142
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,330
example this is pick on something I'm

143
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,480
knowing from Sourcefire is that

144
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,990
who a calm and quiet that I it's not

145
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,980
it's not fair I hope they are offended
that pic big cuddler

146
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,200
so there is this contrasting exploit I'm

147
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,210
that we ended up make a little paper on
call to but I had a patient acting

148
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,710
is to be taken seriously as the title be
honest with you

149
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,900
so this is this cold export and snow

150
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,189
as a rule said 1239 I'm

151
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,360
I mean it's fact twelve-years-old

152
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,470
this room in this is mature as an exam

153
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,210
basically a guy could bring forth poppy
discover the next play out in a while

154
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:35,370
reversed engineered to I made RF power
lies

155
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,470
and is a bit about he said that as a
joke a RFP yeah I like skeptical

156
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,910
and what he stands out that the X was no
one's 2008 so among

157
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,410
no Ramon of the talking point at 98 box

158
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,930
retirement on should be gone review

159
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:55,110
remotely Reebok basically this is like a
nap by of fun ability

160
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,490
was discovered that he had like no
frontman source host field

161
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,300
chip Bok review fuck 3/4 but he finds
this

162
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,930
out in the wild this is not discovered
in a lob this is discovered

163
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:12,000
out from the Bach right side basically

164
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,070
from Alexis look funny script called
North Carolina 7 when he goes easy setup

165
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,060
communication session use in that pile

166
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,560
from beavis says yep yep and put in the
source code at the

167
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,180
the PRC how to hate me for this is hard
coded message

168
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,380
so what the the I yes guys thought was
good idea

169
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,290
which to start looking for anything on
at everything within that bio section

170
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:40,180
with the string beavis yep yep

171
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,830
not not turn off rockman yep yep

172
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,930
all ideas innovation stop with this
first question

173
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,540
what if I doc doc .doc what if I

174
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,400
trying to compete this apartheid

175
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,640
guess what just have a detection ago

176
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,820
but have a syntactic but this proving

177
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,340
that there's a better joking at is
proving the dangers character matching

178
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,270
you know that much one character beavis
pick ax another

179
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,300
I'm these in stock strikeouts

180
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,420
but I have a room that particular looks
of this vulnerability

181
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,980
are they protected because tax was found
in the wild

182
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,080
I can guarantee you the original author
didn't have a nap I'll session

183
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,190
said beavis yep yep I can assure you

184
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,580
the problem is complex is complex you
can't get around that

185
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,820
you know you need to the more complex
the threat

186
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,550
the more complex than that this
signature has to be is common sense

187
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,430
I'm bar as we all know things like to
talk about three per

188
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,640
I like to talk about tax breaks its
throughput throughput group

189
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,660
I'm TV monitor an IDS system

190
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,670
3 view are you looking to talk everyone
else board

191
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:58,240
their a if anyone has ever tried to
purchase

192
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,290
are all gone through band how tell me
the last time you look to anything

193
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,730
detection related I actually told you to
text ranks

194
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,060
it's like a little cartel going on that
it's almost like the first move them

195
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,420
the first to like IDS don't talk about
tax rates

196
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,680
second with my DS's don't talk about tax
breaks

197
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,770
so the cartel that when never talk about
it they

198
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,790
fight each other on 3 per now we we had
to come get full duplex

199
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,800
you know we can handle 10,000 syntax
connections fuck

200
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,150
great ice disinterested what you pick up

201
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,590
your job the Cuisinart

202
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,110
for the problem with complexes is that
it requires more processing there is

203
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,650
absolutely no way around it

204
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,720
I'm so what the hall meetings

205
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,710
is that you'll throughput becomes a
little bit limited certainly in

206
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,340
like IPS world because your trump its

207
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,880
active members in the middle spot market
gateway or months

208
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,430
so if it requires time to process that
traffic

209
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:03,520
stocks monica is processed IDS doesn't
have that same issue

210
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,040
I and so did you see like ideas being
deployed

211
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,200
and scottie situations because

212
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,560
you know of false positives to take the
metro system I'm

213
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,270
you know we have a a plan spin Dundee in
Scotland where I come from

214
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,770
from Metra mccaw ties surprisingly

215
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,870
and that I take them day to shut the
plant down

216
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,680
on a date to be set back up again she
can imagine those will reduce the roach

217
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,500
stupid rules looking for beavis

218
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,630
blah blah blah being in control your IP
a situation that brings down

219
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,950
so bar long story short

220
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,700
everything takes more process and that
means time I'm just 3 per

221
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,880
slightly cursed there's no way around a
act takes Medicaid guesses at this point

222
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,190
I have a map and I D S on and I can tell
me what their detection rates of

223
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,430
you know and have helped them for years
and i cant get the most

224
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,020
tell me what the throughput has been on
the state I'm

225
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,630
you know probably con tell me the amount
of threats that they actually define the

226
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,490
contest

227
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,730
where they can well tell me about that
false positives 'cause buoyed up

228
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,860
this is that my of

229
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,260
II to talk recently on false positive
reviews were really like a

230
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,050
I was using false positives and I cast
context

231
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:20,510
you numerate you're all set so for
off-site static strings

232
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm you if you were running like snow
you would react this way

233
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,650
for tens this you would react that way
and now I know that you're running

234
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:32,590
this rule set with protocol
normalization gotta gotta gotta gotta

235
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,070
are to talk about it and I'm

236
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,220
I've said I think you massively
underestimate the issue

237
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,240
ready run talk about use in huh

238
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,930
i'm talking about a bad guy with I'm
underestimate situation

239
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,800
they have a deal with 25,000
false-positive today

240
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,070
how the money stuff with I think

241
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,440
this killed across that the the the
marketplace when we talk about

242
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,250
why people can't talk to me about the
tax rates for come talk to me about

243
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,570
three per

244
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,660
is because the van is how this whole
area so no

245
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,140
arm terminology almost you know I mean

246
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,810
we we're almost like crack addicts know
that we need to have it

247
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:20,400
and I'm we don't care where it comes
from as long as it like

248
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,680
these the addiction and that that they
are not marked

249
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,900
we don't as a community ask and pushes
match and a

250
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,130
and some food for thought for people who
are monitoring and managing IT Act

251
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:35,780
if literally oxy sup we 500 trucks your
box today

252
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,260
you will you detect 900 we detect 99% of
them

253
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:44,400
we detect I'm when you step 15 he's a
very simple questions to ask you sir

254
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,910
Don Hart on city but give you a rough
idea about

255
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,930
ship that's not working with I expect to

256
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,350
you guys ever heard about ice axe there
are testing lop

257
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,280
and an independent customer yes products
it's really cool to go like the

258
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,870
commercial guys am

259
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,240
I'm you is an are not gone by the report
of them

260
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,860
and the reason that you do this is it
better to spend $3.4 Graham

261
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,990
with like an ass ass get their
independent testing recall

262
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:16,200
then spent a quarter-million on this
anomaly detection

263
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,640
thing would like to fall over blah blah
blah nothing about

264
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,020
and then assessed asking of him first
time around from taxing

265
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:28,120
like how successful do you think an idea
system S

266
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,200
normally for some things up in the air
if you want to

267
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,320
Roche I okay and assess first fantastic

268
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,660
get action right around 28 Sep

269
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,400
own who that's not now I'm I'm I'm like
advanced

270
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,680
troll my post on our and call me old
fashion but the clues in the name

271
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,800
out of the those like 20 a over 100
threats

272
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,030
they misdiagnosed 15 I so basically

273
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,540
they are they thought it was this threat
when I was actually

274
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,059
of threat so if we're being kinda like

275
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:08,459
anal about that situation that's a false
positive

276
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,650
even at the you know the consequence was
right

277
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,439
you thought it was something else and
yours both to get that shit

278
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,789
right that that's your job the clues in
the neck your detection system

279
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:24,699
so you can be able to live in a bit hard
on them say well look actually

280
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:28,149
you for you gonna go 15 this app

281
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:31,570
the bring a lot although they bring in
their internets the second round testing

282
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,960
what you think tax rates go up to

283
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,809
96 I'm

284
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:43,299
which proves that if you stick engineer
that knows what they're doing

285
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:47,049
these things can like catch and box that
job

286
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:50,049
the promises they have 30 living room
sets

287
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:54,999
because 3 per acuna lost of I'll scuffle
are stupid stuff as well

288
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:59,149
you know like as a beaver use gas and
being all about locking up to gone

289
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:02,159
kindness of you so you're

290
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:06,450
it's important to stop we have
disgracing security you we never applied

291
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,679
for ownership

292
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,749
trust but verify and I think you know
you you need to do that

293
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:14,600
an idea the problem is doing that now

294
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,720
is that not much really have a clue

295
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,519
not finance book like my constant look
hey

296
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:24,990
Mike I'll we were at da protection
system is awesome

297
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:30,409
so wanna got company in to do it you got
company and

298
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:35,269
they say right okay will be to taste
testing one day reporting

299
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:40,419
doubt about it I'm sure anyone to some
sort of remember that story quite well

300
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,749
sure it's today's report no one day
above all

301
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:47,440
far what happens then

302
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,659
is that in the end you just got a guy

303
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:54,899
dick some pastor I'm I'm one of those
dudes the cat told

304
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:58,509
hey you're about to die cast assessment
okay

305
00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:02,519
also I'm what you want me to do all that
go

306
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:06,210
you know if the clients that say he says
the right that's

307
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,249
yeah dramatized

308
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:16,249
IPS a crime to the cat up

309
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:20,120
a pic on the fastest had a mean it takes
we got their tix like

310
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,549
right how do you like yes testing on it
is good like the some pocket

311
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:25,009
manipulation skopje

312
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:28,850
in do this do da you be right report on
it

313
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:33,350
it's alright yes taxed idk

314
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,720
basically Hakka box Massport and if you
pick it up the

315
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,249
we won you know we got re okay

316
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:45,059
at school but we've really done is to
try to bypass the texan

317
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,379
much just left map hey an idea system
could be said for

318
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:52,470
you would have none other news water is
wet you know

319
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,860
don't get there is no benefit and that
sort taxed

320
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,669
because him know that there's a failure
hate you knew that before

321
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:05,960
that's where you us to do to look at it
you didn't think things are good

322
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,990
he Kevin any if a teacher anyway yeah it
is bought them

323
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,049
and then you like how do we fix it oh
you be me

324
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:17,080
we don't know became an added some stuff
on a computer in

325
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,799
our system is hot the problem is the
test is not

326
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,200
recreate a bone basis of last kiss his
rock coming right

327
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,129
the problem with that situation ends is
that

328
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:32,539
you need to spend time generating your
traffic

329
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:35,809
you know people run off on time at work
truck box on the network

330
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:40,440
now tell me if my castle fact and it's
not this is not recreate simple

331
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,509
it's not a scientific taxed scientific
tests require it to be recreativo

332
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:49,740
getting some dude with Islamic laptop
organ at work playing around like

333
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,740
I'm SO 867 when does get cool

334
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,139
what did you learn from that ne think
you let that

335
00:20:56,139 --> 00:21:00,629
you secure devices shit would not you
know

336
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:04,139
what you need to do start looking up
actually capturing samples

337
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:09,259
and allow I'm using goes against my yes
there's a lot of benefit from doing max

338
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:12,879
a is probably the recognize way if doing
stuff with IPS

339
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:16,399
rather than getting a sacrificial hosts
on the network him

340
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:20,899
that some dude cock away you get it
sacrificial host and allow

341
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:24,149
and collect lots and lots mocks samples

342
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:27,519
clean op and use TCP replay or something

343
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,100
rewrite the pockets from on them against
the idea

344
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,249
surprisingly people don't do that and
yet it's common sense

345
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:38,480
not quite there maybe

346
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,509
evander Hans a true

347
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:44,929
that you can use for evasion technique
that

348
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:48,669
likes me quite allow them well known in
the

349
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:52,600
in the industry for marketing and
they've released the tomb

350
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,850
is a almost the web application

351
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,960
I cast task so you get a

352
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,259
the abdomen and other the avenues to
come in at work and

353
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:05,610
you go over the IPS many take boxes

354
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,830
and press play about as I guess that's

355
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,149
parking any shouldn't be too cold

356
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:16,269
wrap up for that but but that's how we
testing of stuff now

357
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:19,789
no because the problem but I is this
icon time around here

358
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:24,369
who runs IDS cam sakar icon like say hey
have you seen this thread how does the

359
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:25,090
IPS work

360
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,529
he's an email his capture what you think

361
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:32,649
we can't do that because when off on a
retrieval process

362
00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:36,090
and if anyone's ever have monies I guess
orders you know I'm gonna go

363
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:39,509
that it literally is like I could do

364
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:42,929
he scratched his head like me and with a
test is

365
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:46,590
desktop know because we do this it's not
really

366
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:49,919
there's no methodology to know i mean

367
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,369
we have this by publication taxing that
you go to wrap up

368
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:56,759
you watch it a good you go often because
our while aspin

369
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:00,249
check the top tags methodology HD dock

370
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:03,869
we don't have to 90 s my what people say
to me

371
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:07,759
left right left or okay to be people who
have

372
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,090
not come to school because it's like yes
but there are some people like

373
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,139
gay I look after how do I a test it

374
00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:17,909
it's like something I could download the
walkthrough min Aung

375
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:21,259
nothing crossing we wrote five pages
today

376
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:24,409
at be five pages more that stuff that's
it you know it

377
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:28,649
shock but 123 testing is just to make
sure that we

378
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:31,929
spending time prepping are taxed what's
the I did from

379
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:36,480
Abraham Lincoln I have six hours ago
treat on it spent the first five hours

380
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,360
shopping

381
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,879
ox we use it for Facebook

382
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:44,429
my squad least why the sailor but he's
right

383
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:48,549
you know but its make sure that your
test prep because I can also pick up

384
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:49,379
taxed

385
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:53,110
contact Clanton say hey see this likes
rack

386
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,239
we thought we were detected like be
sought be safe

387
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:59,399
didn't work out is a capture

388
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:02,649
did we miss configure or is this
something wrong you know it

389
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:06,450
it enables you to be able to communicate
scientifically in fact

390
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,830
also means the if you've got mauled
multi-site you could send the stuff of

391
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,369
I'm enough test isn't different
locations testing the set

392
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:18,989
same standardized testing and as I say I
some serious advantages if you have it

393
00:24:18,989 --> 00:24:19,340
do

394
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,499
that that's like hockey match play sale
x8x

395
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:26,379
23 minutes correct boy you can army hop

396
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:29,379
Axum Outback switched on any one day

397
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:33,139
TCP replay you can play like 3/4
thousand exploits

398
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:36,399
in like seconds

399
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:42,749
so that web application taxed all of
that HTTP evasions can be replayed

400
00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:47,009
someone may have copped them I all those
can be replayed

401
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:50,279
and like of a second and eyes

402
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:54,080
evader basically overtakes TTP stuff
taken care of

403
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,769
because it takes time to our and I mean
only what's happening this paper which

404
00:24:58,769 --> 00:24:59,409
is taken

405
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:03,039
Rana adid SK okay let's hotbox

406
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,799
crazy but let's do something a little
bit better

407
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,049
I mean 16 what's been to Texas don't
think it's too much to ask a comment

408
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:12,619
rooting section from my status as well

409
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:16,929
the once a threat has been detected
should consistently be detected

410
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:21,470
credit that means like if you detect it
wants you to 10 times a hundred times a

411
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,710
million times

412
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,440
it always gets the tactical how do you
prove

413
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,749
stop if you can score dude with box

414
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:33,450
didn't ship Kong I'm

415
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,629
as it is a great product from my problem
round ownership still to

416
00:25:36,629 --> 00:25:40,090
a.m. they offer thousand tracks

417
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:43,909
force throughput I of four thousand park
with rocks

418
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:48,179
I am and what happens when you think
that new popular threat

419
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,470
comes on to mark a to the one at the end
I like

420
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,570
that still further

421
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,049
would no longer protect against that
threat just

422
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:01,639
what's right with your old we've gone
about its done now

423
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:05,690
so with this product something that's
all ru always get through

424
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:12,690
at every single time or some throughput

425
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:18,389
the issue in a nutshell is like we have
two problems

426
00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:22,269
a as an organized isn't industry we have
no

427
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:26,090
kinda universe away expressing like IPS
IDS test

428
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:29,179
nowhere close to be able to communicate
with each other

429
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:33,080
because what it meant to say there's the
security guys because say well you know

430
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,369
product axe if you do this kinda does
the tech

431
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:40,269
are but if you do it that way the data
when I like have a common standard

432
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:41,629
language to speak

433
00:26:41,629 --> 00:26:45,179
or body or a framework to work around

434
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:49,009
secondly really we reinvent the wheel so
everyone's experience

435
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:52,320
dice with them mod announced documenting

436
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,929
so you know accompany has to be
sarcastic ass to

437
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:01,369
comic its good reputation for being a
tease I kept texting

438
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:06,210
dude moves to another company promise to
his reputation

439
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,269
new company has built a reputation
thought about it up what he knows goes

440
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:10,269
with him

441
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:14,529
came over France not a good way to do
things because there's a lot of money

442
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:17,950
involved in that's sits on a network I'm

443
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,840
in assigning let's be honest with you so
anyhow type yes

444
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,220
you know fast track team capture the
flag going

445
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,629
I'm was a low sec 17 and I'm

446
00:27:28,629 --> 00:27:31,700
people forget you don't get the security
devices were in play

447
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,590
you know bet your ass the hot credit
card data

448
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:39,210
PCR requires into protection system
there is no other way round up

449
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,759
they will have one that didn't attack
ship

450
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:47,480
since nineteen and I'm the open source
network intrusion framework

451
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,559
for tomorrow the clues and I miss
Arkansas

452
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:56,210
so resource deficit we set up an
organization for like four walks

453
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,919
with a long-term goal of producing on
open-source freely available testing

454
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,350
methodology

455
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,570
so like we can eventually get to the
state is a

456
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:10,100
community when someone says hey some mac
download the toast me how to test this

457
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,369
we can commute as a community say hate
your there is

458
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:18,149
so when I saw at my work I minus the
talk the company I were contest

459
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:21,980
don't make sense my time caucus up and
running and I went around us but what's

460
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,259
a different people both

461
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:26,590
and RDS testing 90 throughout the
industry in said

462
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:31,049
a what do you think about like happen or
what sort of organization where we could

463
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:33,179
like get a methodology the

464
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:37,539
yet at Publix 800 members really copy
the go great throughput

465
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:41,299
we really interesting what action you
you know

466
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:44,759
do you think as an industry we need to
and everyone University yeah

467
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:48,529
we do that's really cool so my minutes
about 35 savers

468
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:53,259
they're involved in idsi yes testing one
of the things that

469
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:56,350
is very clear that ourself organization
should be

470
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:00,070
its documentation project and nothing
else

471
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,210
and what I mean by that stop
methodologies

472
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:07,690
should tell you what to task for not how
to do it

473
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:11,259
you know not what tool you task for who
cares

474
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:14,539
thank you task for X mindset is an
organization pick me too

475
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:17,929
that the freedom to say will invest

476
00:29:17,929 --> 00:29:21,239
X amount of dollars because we don't
know you lose a scenic I what we doing

477
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:25,470
x1 Zack you know by this proprietary to
because you free sometime up or

478
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,919
organization might say

479
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:30,379
we want a balanced I'm not so we're not
gonna got a prior to

480
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:34,529
much like or what listings though

481
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:38,820
I was famous for as a top time I bet you
can guess what motivation for the top

482
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,619
five things

483
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:42,820
I'm this is not like or what

484
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:46,850
but it is this is like a top five things
that

485
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,119
you should just kinda be aware of what
my yes they should ties for have a look

486
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,019
at I'm

487
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:54,960
it's not conclusive methodology by any
way shape or form up

488
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,210
you know the basic bare minimum
standards missus been

489
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,940
from me discussing about 25-30
interested parties we have a maintenance

490
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,869
you are welcome to come both join in its
costs in on the source stuff where we

491
00:30:06,869 --> 00:30:08,289
kind of myself

492
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:11,440
what sort of thing should be tested for
hopefully the top 10

493
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,950
a top 5 live over time 22 time

494
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:19,039
the the choice was start with time and
forced 10 things

495
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,259
and the problem that I was lucky say hi
in a small

496
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:25,389
as foreign dude makes this season it's
not democracy

497
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:28,509
improbable on while acx.com

498
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:31,619
fix a problem what congress top 5

499
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:35,269
that's been built from other people what
the community discusses anchored

500
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:38,279
another evolve with time what it needs
to be

501
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:43,049
I'm I'm gonna go through what the top
time with the top five we've got so far

502
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:47,299
I'm things should be looking out for on
your device or if you doing some for

503
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:48,509
testing

504
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:52,609
a best practice guide bar speaks before
they need I am

505
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:57,200
and a lot of the industry people saying
to me that I'm

506
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,960
we meet we need proper documentation
about how to the poor the stop

507
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,419
because idiots quite wrong

508
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:09,399
and this is an example for so you know
PCI

509
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:13,669
see that that thing where it says you
need like a detection system

510
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:18,340
Barack you see this like encrypt it on a
Yukon breakup

511
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:25,340
so what we see is the CIPS deployed and
the Middle Eastern Creek to 10 points

512
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:29,090
within our means a kick returner because
the car on break

513
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:32,999
the time because then it's not PCI
compliant

514
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:37,289
which means that you can on me have at
one point you don't have control

515
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:41,779
won the endpoints on your end point I'm
a second in our point

516
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:46,419
as credit card data spoke to be held
clear for your car

517
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:50,619
you card why to the need to take
consistent with the contact the traffic

518
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:51,450
fines much

519
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:55,059
behavior but this is this this situation
is funny

520
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:58,859
because I understand why that's happened

521
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:01,929
people on the bookstore always
understand why that's happened

522
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:06,690
and isohunt.com say since that we've
never had a false positive

523
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,929
yeah I have a true positive no we often

524
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:14,429
that's a pretty good sign that there's
something not quite right

525
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:18,239
because if you like I don't know about
you but

526
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:21,549
IPS that that shit false positives all
the time

527
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:24,759
hey look something up and can you give
me a lot thanks

528
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:28,210
you know not having one is a big
indicator

529
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:31,399
so the top five we really need to look
at misconfiguration

530
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:34,649
I'm really need to test this this needs
to be

531
00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:39,169
the these in on way of order I any way
shape or form like this is more

532
00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:41,419
important not or anything like that

533
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:44,789
but if you're looking and I guess you've
got my PS

534
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:48,229
I know it might be teaching you to suck
expert tells me shoulder it's been

535
00:32:48,229 --> 00:32:51,960
configured properly and that you don't
have census data

536
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:58,909
pointing that walls and doing nothing
Kim wasting people's time

537
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:01,909
it's just fail to be honest with you
when you see it that way

538
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:05,159
I'm so there's a lot of people that are
out literally got to that point

539
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:08,799
get to that point IPS you'd be surprised
how many times I hear this story

540
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:13,049
when I say regularly well I mean is
about once a week

541
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:16,479
right different sources different
clients

542
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:21,149
you want I speak like USA because of it
what's it like

543
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:25,129
they'll tell you yet another IPS in a
trip to that point what some

544
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:29,789
why do people make mistakes top 5
configuration issues

545
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:33,450
false positive reviews this is in our
top five

546
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:37,009
this is something I've pushed be on city
because

547
00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:41,249
I believe that folks 'cause abuse is on
the state

548
00:33:41,249 --> 00:33:45,190
is massively dangerous on is a very big
indicator

549
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,619
both positive false positives are easy
to call false positives because you have

550
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:48,869
no

551
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,519
contacts and thank you organizations ago
false-positive three months car and it

552
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,820
turned out not to be a false positive
but

553
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,820
actual brick eggs at No context about
talk

554
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,970
the problem is is that you me too

555
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,899
think me to monitor the full force it
abuses

556
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:11,359
monstro landmark you know you can just
do it would no way someone

557
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,500
if they find out they will laugh they
will kill you

558
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,940
I think honestly because he's just its
part well

559
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,760
commercially take organizations that and
twenty-five to fifty thousand false

560
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,799
positives today

561
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:26,000
17 false positives per min

562
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,629
how do you honestok but more importantly
what is the cost and managing

563
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:35,059
because if you take your like that
sysadmins

564
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:38,500
senior of the double text of

565
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,679
that plan now is being wasted your
detection system

566
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,309
that isn't doing things right

567
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:49,280
and I don't think many organizations ask
themselves commercially

568
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,869
what we lose by having like ship rules

569
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:55,919
what we actually dollar site leasing
concurrently

570
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,059
you not making money you losing money
and if you manage that situation

571
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:03,500
batter you my hobby have to go back to
minus is a sacred

572
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,520
months the situation better and it saves
a hundred run

573
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,059
who for school arm

574
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:15,039
here it is I the nineties call ask for
their flock frock

575
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:18,380
fragmentation its

576
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,770
shockingly true but that shit still
works like

577
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,829
96 or a paper come out that that or

578
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:27,849
wat to like live wiska which

579
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:32,490
ended up being partner Kito ideas
bassist of this is awful paper and

580
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,920
ninety-six

581
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,890
about flock flock fragmentation to top
the coffin box and so using

582
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:44,250
I i'm katherine is one the problem is is
if you can RFC

583
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,710
what you do is you are look at the RC

584
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:51,970
and wherever like this a gray area that
the RSC's left the implementer

585
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:55,760
to make a decision sees left windows to
come up with that all links to come up

586
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,069
with a independently

587
00:35:57,069 --> 00:36:01,140
river that normally happens you that
your us this night yes agent at me

588
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,920
that because those guys they don't
communicate with each other

589
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,359
and you have programs to handle things
should be standardized but not

590
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,490
and protocol white ambiguity is the main
reason

591
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:18,869
like pros call normalization it is the
the only defense that they have

592
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:23,799
and reality and literally find it if you
find if you find like an RC

593
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:27,359
the city IP protocol that a bit ago and
I

594
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,780
you find where it's quite clear you have
a

595
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,890
you love a tall order thanks

596
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:37,599
evasion techniques on it as well up how
many view

597
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:43,180
how many have you could tell me where
you can guide yesterday's attack me

598
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,650
Metasploit I am meat-eater

599
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:51,200
all have ideas a patient at me my setup
and test is

600
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,270
current type show basins

601
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,510
yeah if you want to run out when Sean
like Massport

602
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,609
get on your your exports up if you touch
ovations

603
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:05,280
it will tell you what they sent exports
test but verify those

604
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,619
anyone's ever heard me talk about this
before don't trust

605
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:11,900
everything comes out much for track

606
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:16,260
you're on a capture new unit is make
sure that its theory might say next yr

607
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,670
science and math you've got lots of
places where you can go and get basic

608
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,390
techniques

609
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:25,549
test you ideas for across the face and
techniques

610
00:37:25,549 --> 00:37:28,880
maybe come let let's talk about
conservation techniques restart

611
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,079
registered trademark I don't know

612
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:34,520
I'm basically we do you get to

613
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,210
really old evasion techniques put them
together and then you say you've got

614
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,420
164 new advanced evasion techniques

615
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:46,150
we sell a product that's a true story by
Taylor

616
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:50,549
for months months months like I'll
police Const facing techniques

617
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:53,700
and of course CDs reserve for them and
I'm

618
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,049
what what was a story how to be what's
going on

619
00:37:57,049 --> 00:37:59,890
we're not talking anymore on because
this is responsible disclosure you don't

620
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:02,049
you provide all the things but Wu

621
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:05,680
release the information later on and
they never did

622
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,190
and later on we sought some mines and
looking up other people signature

623
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,309
updates and I'm

624
00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:14,400
these all seem to be TC RTC really

625
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,549
0 so what you've done is the front man
stuff

626
00:38:17,549 --> 00:38:20,619
and used white TCP segmentation on top
of that

627
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:24,770
and now you that that's new that's not
new dealership for ages

628
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,630
I'm it is critical to the combat sport
in a certainly not to want

629
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:32,510
20 grant the license to I'm

630
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,010
sorry it's mine my little pop there

631
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,299
they did this light like cyclically ok
stop

632
00:38:39,299 --> 00:38:42,750
tax rates of course that's been a top
five

633
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:46,490
you know you should be able to even if
its monitoring poorly

634
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,970
you should be able to at the and at
least say

635
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:52,970
if we had a thousand threats we've got
fiftieth

636
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:58,280
you have 50 center you know even if its
like to suck up the pain

637
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,380
maybe not such a bad thing so that
that's the top let's not talk five

638
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,609
all these are open for public debate
this is what we returned my call for

639
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:06,400
version

640
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,710
remaining last week you know about stuff
to get links for

641
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:13,030
if you want to get involved in shoot
share

642
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:17,240
argue this stuff out as an industry
let's fix this problem because

643
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,230
if we take some ownership as a community
work trying to get

644
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,609
IDS functioning properly just need to
find someone

645
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:29,059
let them do they think that's cool I V
12 coming months make money fine

646
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:32,690
we text mining ship fix it because it's
close on frontline

647
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:39,470
outs that that means to justify what we
do not them

648
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:43,650
and said very very very legitimate
question to ask her to text system

649
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:47,329
right don't be shy se que what he's
attacked

650
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:50,780
and it isn't is a vertically this book
test

651
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,859
or Snickers is is a good idea a test
companies as well

652
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:57,539
I'm because now you have fun

653
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:00,650
now you have my PS offering

654
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:04,500
you know your test for the top five at
least you can report something a problem

655
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,700
the situation we've got one

656
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,440
music just running into I write a pool
report says

657
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,329
your ideas like school three lemons up
to oranges and it's awesome

658
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:17,250
and another guy writes reports is yeah I
guess is rounded it does that started

659
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:21,569
out as I joined up thinking you can take
a report from one company

660
00:40:21,569 --> 00:40:25,589
and understand your findings so by doing
this

661
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:29,079
we have a standardized sort of approach
not you know

662
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:32,789
however companies do it do it for if you
can turn around and say

663
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:36,260
has a 52 grams methodology house factor
against a top-five

664
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:41,289
Akhtar it give some context

665
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:44,430
as an organization probably lower drug
and fail

666
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:48,420
well you know our compliance season
demographers overnight yes but it

667
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,549
doesn't help you

668
00:40:49,549 --> 00:40:52,549
when you get breached sorry didn't turn
around the web hey

669
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:56,559

671
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,640
having something to complain series in

672
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,770

infrastructure

673
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:10,000
you know don't forget you protect
against all the ups in all 20 days to

674
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,760
