1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,550
K between get started

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,420
so we talking about

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,050
I guess my my official title is the
security or insecurity

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,920
of third-party I what's up okay since
with so then switched around

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,349
basically that he is that um well talk
about the city

6
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:27,259
or that second personal well I within
Syria I work for a company called

7
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:33,230
I'll active I was part of the security
research group called the trick

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,270
in Eva blog update once or twice

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,760
year um so

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,330
yell 72 was just talking about it when
it isn't about um

11
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,940
the talks about comments for issues that
i've seen

12
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,620
in third-party I was applications so I
perhaps iPhone apps that

13
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:56,070
you know written not-for-us: written by
third parties for it I'll cover

14
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,879
comes to shoes that I i've see you
noticed and then I'll try to

15
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,989
um present some medications or fixes

16
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:06,600
for the issues that I i for across a

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,180
and all document how to exploit
somebody's in some cases

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,010
um what is it about his book No soccer's
a their number I'll

19
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,820
I was up case out there people talk
about the actual s

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,180
or other deal breakers cuttings I won't
talk about that

21
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,380
up to some extent I will cover
shortcomings the summit the eyes and I

22
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:25,979
worse

23
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,640
but again that sexter forty stuff not
the OS itself

24
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,829
um bookmark explore

25
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:37,130
a couple years ago you know when the
iPhone came out on Android and

26
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,640
also you know you have hundreds of
thousands ap San these ups was written

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,840
by all sorts of different developers the
company's

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,079
um and it say about to turn after

29
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,420
years ago um rehab we sort getting

30
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,219
customer demands from from our customers
and

31
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:56,819
I rematch in order I'm 30 min to get
some women's

32
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,219
up to review mobile app specifically I
was outs

33
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:04,479
a in at the time there was very little
known about it

34
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,859
secure ourselves I'm I've done

35
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:12,210
a about all you know 20 or so in the
last three years

36
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,420
and business first is the sort of my my
collection of notes

37
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,090
what I've learned in those two years the
common

38
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,030
to the issues I see Morong you know a
large said

39
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,340
I was up cases and things that i've seen
I was developers

40
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,709
do wrong consistently um

41
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:36,400
yes affording that you know it's discuss
the case if I was for a second um

42
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,730
I Lesseps almost over 18 up case what
that means is the written

43
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,060
in I'm objective-c which is I'm

44
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,519
the sorter offspring from the ceiling
which

45
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,659
I'm it's a it's a strict the soup so
what that means is that

46
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:54,510
I'm every Val PCC code Isabel

47
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,890
his objective Seco um runs and I was
which is basically

48
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,890
from so report of Mac OS two the on CPU

49
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,580
there's a number things she's been
essentially its Mac OS or on CPU

50
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,290
um this thing up used to be about the
dick to seize the

51
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,189
they offer a bunch of classes and
Medizin objects

52
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:16,290
secure vault room level: um issues

53
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,379
up to 20 min real case and the kind of
stuff and

54
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,680
we go back to will get back to that part
in a little while

55
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,010
a so the first thing we talk about is

56
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,439
Transport Security the you know assess

57
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:34,829
I'm there are a large number I was
absolutely to Social Security

58
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:39,010
to a backup server or a web service were
you know some kind middleware

59
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,110
um they tend to use a cell for that

60
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,909
in the way to do that is a risley create
a %uh this

61
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:49,129
your older 0 connection a

62
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:53,610
object and you pass it just you know
you're like you to your browser. East

63
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,450
yes call stocks last and then you know
all this magic happens behind your back

64
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,909
in SL happens in or

65
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:04,010
was your case that happens um the thing
is that they're hoping to the fort in

66
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,670
there that aren't quite as good as they
should be

67
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,569
and so there's a listing for full safety
so few just means collection you turn on

68
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:10,209
a sniffer

69
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,299
um you'll see so what this whale shark

70
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:16,500
and if you look through the site for
something you have the this the standard

71
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,160
ones that are

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,320
good but then you know there's also
number of

73
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,990
ciphers that or that for you sock a

74
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,960
including you know I'm export ciphers
your forty-fifth experts I for second

75
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,450
stuff

76
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,610
this is not the kinda stuff that you
want to have on but it's there

77
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,780
%uh it's on by default up there's no
document which trade-off

78
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,780
and it's actually documented that
there's no document which trade-off

79
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,800
applehead Apple has a secure coding
guidelines

80
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,860
in there excuse me but here they say no
you secure transport

81
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,990
for OS I'm your test work program it a

82
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,970
interface is not available use the CF
networking interface instead

83
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:58,390
um its YES Network Inc does not allow
you to treat to Cyprus's

84
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:02,140
I'm so that the problem with what I was
that the order so because it's also an

85
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,950
ex post

86
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,840
they're sorta passable talk with them
and they're not grainy or not they don't

87
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,560
expose

88
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,630
large functions um still functional the

89
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,380
to developers I and I mean I can see
that being

90
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,790
you know trying to make things easier
for developers but something like

91
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,080
allowing you to decipher suit would be I
think would be a great thing to export

92
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,620
to users I think looks real do that at
the present time the kids

93
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,970
which makes this cat difficult because
if you have to set a

94
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,020
before weeks I for suits in UK it
changes

95
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,540
then you can really fix the issue um

96
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,070
but you can mitigate its so you can say
I won't use

97
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,910
apples you know peaked in a solo very
and I'll take my own version

98
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,290
oversell world take you there are some
other celebrities at our bill through

99
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,200
and better stuff like that

100
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,690
a see YSL read so you can use those

101
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:57,090
I'm no no this is usually when I saw her
doing these things

102
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,590
this was I was 3i was for a and they had
these weak ciphers

103
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,150
since then I think Apple took note of
this I'm in for I was five and six

104
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,080
the removed two weeks I first which is a
good thing but it still

105
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,470
you don't see still have a functional
you can at a site for you can remove the

106
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,110
cipher

107
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,070
might be that you know the cuts weak
ones but tomorrow so we'll find

108
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,810
you know affordability with the other
side versus to expose you can't turn it

109
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,380
off

110
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,210
right a so things are better now than
they were two years ago

111
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:33,210
but you still have to functionally that
you want

112
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,690
so when I that stupid idea over so

113
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,100
odium I was secure programming guide

114
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,550
on the docket said a that you know

115
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,770
transport the secure transfer
programming not available you see if

116
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,020
network

117
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,660
its I suspect another with your network
up and see if it were also does like to

118
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,730
set the cipher suits

119
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,330
I'm oversee that works just like to do a
few other things with SSL

120
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,530
allows you to say that you will allow
expire true to a expired certs who are

121
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,470
you say

122
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,540
you allow public spy roots it will allow

123
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,900
say you take any route you are say that
you don't validate the certificate chain

124
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,810
these are all things that are bad

125
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,940
they're off by default a but you could
have called like

126
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,070
you get that cold like this in your
happens to spur fully felt this will

127
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,520
pass the App Store

128
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,580
I'm where you can say allow expire bus
tickets locks by Ruth

129
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,970
allow any route a don't know that's to
fix a

130
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,160
if you have this peace corps this PC
your coat

131
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,330
a your trying to screw

132
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,410
a luckily the stuff is a known bug folks
%uh

133
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,470
takes a little work for develop screw
this up

134
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,340
up but it happens because this is stuff
you use for deeper

135
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,100
ready if I want to be able to through
see my own a cell that the common

136
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,260
assault traffic

137
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,620
%uh this is these way to do it is to say
you'll take a certain age men into your

138
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:52,920
own

139
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,240
connection for testing and you get to
see you know what the actual the looks

140
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,180
like

141
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,580
a it's what I've had about to case
actually where

142
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,390
people have this this kind of cold a
interCall

143
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,370
and it was a common boxing or debug only
up but they were about the ship

144
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,490
in the retail version still had to sting
or so you retire

145
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,750
you read his reply can say if make sure
you remove the school before you ship

146
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,640
up every there was a a peep about SSL it
came out

147
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,140
week or so ago sorta same thing we're
you know for deferred to browse

148
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,200
ourselves pretty good

149
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,690
but when you look at non browser type
stuff like Iowa saps

150
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,940
a these kinda things are quite common
for people don't go the certificates

151
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,669
they don't

152
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,740
you know they allow expire roots in the
kinda stuff this is this is a very calm

153
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,019
very much on topic

154
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:41,610
this stuff does happen I it's good that
Osama the full

155
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,800
for too many people you have a dog for
debugging or for whatever reason for it

156
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,399
could offer the ship

157
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,209
also something that makes you if you're
lookin I was at work here I know asap

158
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:56,649
me to keep this in mind this is you know
quite important stuff

159
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:59,670
okay I'm we'll go from there to a

160
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,420
your own you world have urs I'm so
basically

161
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,069
um when you're talking about initially I
guess that from

162
00:09:07,069 --> 00:09:10,089
when i phone to clear out a and we're
off

163
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:15,279
allowed to make up cases for the iPhone
um there was sort of decision with Apple

164
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,430
where they said I'm we're not gonna
we're gonna have this first victim box

165
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,790
and

166
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,240
as for the sandbox we don't want ap
stalking Twitchell

167
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,689
and I mean security wise it's kinda
commendable have these kinda

168
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:30,610
very strict said rules in place I'm but
it's a little bit too strict because

169
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,329
sometimes developers

170
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:36,089
one have apt to talk to each other up
sometimes even you know you have

171
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:37,750
absolutely for companies that

172
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,100
wanna share you know some kinda data to
have

173
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,279
you know so kinda cleverest going on I

174
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,009
this this this was you know way too
strict and developers

175
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:51,019
found a way around it and you what they
did

176
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:55,490
um was basically if your issue however
and we can call it and so we can so use

177
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,649
your honor's

178
00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:00,529
as my PC makers in between two outs a
initially this was

179
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:04,029
hack found by developers a leader on

180
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:07,180
it's really go to Apple's local time now
its

181
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,149
its a common practice it it's now
accepted as a standard way of doing this

182
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:13,509
stuff but it wasn't initially was a hack

183
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:17,490
and now after a sort of braces and
supports it

184
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,689
I'm that is quite simple any up case
erasure you remember

185
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:26,060
a and then another app called euro to
for simplex you

186
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,529
I believe it was initially discover or
publicly documented by the

187
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,749
people from work or chew I was sure that
your although

188
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:37,060
you'll see the ritual calls about

189
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,480
how to use your own districts you like
this basically

190
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,839
you the way it works if you make an app
you have a %uh feel this which is crap

191
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,720
a bunch of a properties for you I was
after you know you can say I've been

192
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,230
he's a crook

193
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,199
a your hunger and the euro is going to
call in this case you

194
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:56,529
my protocol the code was basically

195
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:59,709
it's quite simple well you justify the
call that cool

196
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:02,819
handle open you were already here a

197
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:06,089
and then the moment that you and your
it's called anywhere

198
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:09,509
USC's that says oh I know that's this
particular application

199
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:13,980
a call occasional call that have a low
key role call back on that application

200
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,370
this is all picked into I West mechanism
to do these things

201
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,430
um of the consequences um

202
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,180
yeah anywhere between the two if you're
browsing well so far you go to web page

203
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,009
all the sudden you know this on trust
with Pete's gets the call or tree

204
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:30,399
applications

205
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,199
um on your iPhone he gets to pass it or
Fri arguments which steel case will pass

206
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:36,110
in think

207
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,120
thinks comes from a replication on this
is kinda bad

208
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,920
especially if you don't know about the
reasons I see mechanism and you like

209
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,350
well its own doctrine and I trust God
calls me knows what he's doing said only

210
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,720
two though they didn't think

211
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,129
no sudden you know your forcing

212
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,420
the stuff that he thinks trust the
concerning true

213
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,899
on that's kinda bad I'm

214
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:04,499
so I mean own self as bad um your thing
is I'm

215
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:07,990
if you were to do this kind of tacky
would still need someone on the iPhone

216
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,870
or iPad to browse web site go to your
website and

217
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,939
only then you get right you know jobs
resell

218
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:17,209
gets the call this year I was would have
been easy could

219
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:21,079
find the trick that automatically allows
anybody from

220
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:25,309
anybody for women for one on your local
and just

221
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:29,509
are call these girls turns out that
there's a way to do this as a

222
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:33,589
I was three a here just wifi hotspot
feature in in the

223
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:37,490
iPhone's and iPad's me see what I mean
is if you connect to wifi network for

224
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,110
single-user go to www.apple.com

225
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,199
and if the if it comes back with her
like 30 to response can redirect

226
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,709
arm I was missing was like oh well this
must be a wifi hotspot

227
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:52,499
I wilkes I'll pop up a browser window
for you and I will render this

228
00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:56,139
hotspot wifi p um

229
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:59,559
the sky looks like this I

230
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:02,980
this is basically if you can abuse and
says that if you knock so

231
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,189
if you knock an iPhone or iPad of the
local network

232
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:11,149
go try to reconnect and then you could
force it to go to local staff or

233
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:14,959
they call you go to to my left my local
webserver my local webserver

234
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,279
will host you notice a a a

235
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:22,809
pizza for adults who show called that
allows you to call into any room

236
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:27,100
on so it's whatever way where you know
you don't you don't have to trick you

237
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,620
into using

238
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:33,620
well so far all has acquired for them to
be on your network

239
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,999
um the speeches on by the folks a you
can get rid of it I was three but as if

240
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:39,040
I was for me on

241
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,410
you can't rid of but it's on by default

242
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,740
I since I so dishes I was

243
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,999
to I was the you know the sort of
hackers um

244
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:52,970
wasn't invented and then as I was 4.2

245
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,809
at what Apple did was they give you a
new set of API

246
00:13:56,809 --> 00:14:00,899
through better support the I PC makers
and have the wrong number

247
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,220
I'm prior to that article and local euro
and others on a call back or open era

248
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,869
which is a new one and I would recommend
using that one

249
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:11,100
his inaugural over handle bureau I

250
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,230
for two reasons yes you can the

251
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,350
docking station you get you should get a
I'm

252
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,350
it up as different arguments 20 per year
old and and local hero

253
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,559
a injuries why would record is what rose
because

254
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,410
you guys much more elegant Fred PC are
you don't you no longer have to do

255
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,639
through through the scene with three
arguments

256
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,360
as we have you with an overall was you
thats where yet to form your own and do

257
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,379
you know the question working in

258
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:39,499
you know she warned equals value on
percent

259
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:43,139
to answer CFS who was in the sir I saw
your arguments

260
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:47,809
penalty allows you to basically I'm a
pass optics back at fort

261
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:51,579
and I West will do all the situation the
solution for you

262
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:55,189
us that solves you all the sort of
course years that

263
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:58,720
would call what's yours is that this
realization um thats

264
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,069
one I'm

265
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:05,290
the second one is that I'm the

266
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,309
when when that hope you will call back
it's called

267
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:12,759
a you get to see which application
called you get senior Application ID

268
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,279
and that's interesting because you can
help build the white list were blacklist

269
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:20,790
upset you going to allow the cat to send
a dirty

270
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,920
to good use over the role as a XE
mechanism

271
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,540
you can have a white this is a these
three I West outs with these ID's

272
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,920
I know D's and they are allowed to talk
to me and I will take 30 then if you're

273
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,559
if you're not worthy three-f_ 'it's that
I'm just not gonna take your data

274
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,660
on so it allows you to have sort of a
whitelist things

275
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,399
people that you were after you want to
talk to and no one else gets talked with

276
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,699
so if you must like BC when I was aP's I
would

277
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:52,699
strongly urge using open your own over
Hannover Europe

278
00:15:55,499 --> 00:15:59,249
movie onto a fuse up lets users were
it's a classic

279
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,990
I West allows you to in bed a browser
window

280
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,869
into your I was up and people use it for
two ways obviously

281
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:11,600
first what is you know the user's actual
browse rights you can rows and then go

282
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,379
through a phase is a fort

283
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:17,540
I'm but it's also commonly used not
really is a browser for tourism way

284
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,819
to build up a gooey up for free I was at
because it's

285
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:24,600
just you know it's it's easy gift will
the actual I was Koo it's a little bit

286
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,249
effort

287
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:29,679
if there were a few things worse just
ready to rock or you know it's

288
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:35,189
fairly easy I'm and obviously different
city welcome to JavaScript right

289
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:38,899
a and so you expressly will also who
when when

290
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:43,679
let's first look at you refuse used as a
going elements

291
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,879
on both affordable to attack writer who
because I script

292
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,329
if you render if you build up your HTML
and you put

293
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:53,550
no stuff in there to console interest it
was confirmed that work

294
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,809
pieces like a user data comes off
network or something like that

295
00:16:56,809 --> 00:17:00,610
if you don't escape properly you are
horrible to very trivial

296
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,709
very textbook ross et scripting so if
that can

297
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:08,819
injectors get there in there get cross
site scripting

298
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,410
um no this kinda girl stripping means
the same

299
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,690
functionally than if you were due for
web app except there's no cookies to

300
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:18,140
steal their soul session you can take
over

301
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,950
it's just you know local html in an
iPhone app

302
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,550
so you think it's not really all that
exciting um

303
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:29,150
excepts was allotted develops we'll do
is they will feel

304
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,490
when when they use your with you as a
cool we will build

305
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,980
JavaScript to objective-c brooch on now
by default

306
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,540
a Apple has no support for a job to
Dixie bridge

307
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,730
I'm pretty sure this would have said I
think that my guess is that appealable

308
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,100
said

309
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,580
we think that's a bad idea because I've
security considerations

310
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,260
I'm a bit so what happened was I'm you
have all the sort of

311
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,390
developer forums online for I was absent
probably under as well

312
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,390
up in a bunch of people there is he said
we would like to have a ticket to bridge

313
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,660
and Apple doesn't provide one real build
one for you

314
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,870
in you can you can use this I'm the way
this was done as if you are you a few

315
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,740
you can find a call that cool to start
we would request what I mean is if you

316
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,770
few have to really smell and is in the
kind of leaks

317
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,320
in there and you click on it because
this call back

318
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,610
and it sort of its kind so its need
another hero back

319
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,120
and then you can these who was at URL
through use that to implement

320
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,330
a a JavaScript object Seabridge

321
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,840
I'm this it's different for a

322
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,640
to compare to your I was in the sense
that you're on his global

323
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,670
it works for every app for free we know
for everything

324
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:42,060
we feel a few he should certainly would
request only works for that particular

325
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,610
you know if you in that particular I was
at

326
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,280
with its very much locally grown trigger
if you have a cross-site scripting

327
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,450
bug inside you know a few once you have
your across this really work in sight

328
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:56,310
you have a few and you get the should
certainly request and there's no Texas

329
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,340
a JavaScript to Dixie bridge you have

330
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,670
you know pretty much almost complete
code execution

331
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,990
um once you have that you know you're

332
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,530
depending on what your own imprints or
depending on what this should certainly

333
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,010
request him implements I'm you can you
also

334
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:19,560
all these things are with their for
women JavaScript you are a few

335
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,070
um there so as a bitterly that is a
budget these

336
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,770
on my communities for I was development
and they'll have sample code in one

337
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,540
sample could be sweet as the Sun

338
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,860
like they'll take a TS call you over

339
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,910
and the first argument is a method to
call

340
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,280
and the second a bit less argument
arguments to pass

341
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,410
to the method to call on

342
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,730
and this is one and they found to some
Ubuntu these forms

343
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,870
this is pretty standard template code
that was written by someone else

344
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,430
really like if you want a bill to
transfer to Dixie rich

345
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:55,250
do exactly this and you to see if you
look at yours

346
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,440
it's a TS called your own anger and then
the first thing to do is the

347
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,440
first a arguments a

348
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,950
as is the function identical you all
will make a slick road a function we

349
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,050
call it

350
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,090
a if if you have this with you and

351
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:14,190
discuss a subpoena with you you know get
the call any function

352
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,410
tech to see if the fasten the argument
that you would like

353
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,120
including you know foreigners in the
crystal who dis can easily to complete

354
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,600
code execution

355
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,840
um that's if you use it as a as a coolie
that use it as a browser

356
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,200
I'm they're still things you can do were
specifically

357
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,480
there is a large set of attack surface
there that were that isn't

358
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,560
generally there in a normal the stock
browser example

359
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,120
it does a lot more than regrese te amo
I'm it can actually

360
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,730
parse a very large set of of file
formats

361
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:49,950
and it doesn't without user consent so
it's you go to web base and

362
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,130
automatically

363
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,610
you know this thing can read a PDF file
or unzip a file

364
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,890
or render an excel sheet were in you
know files

365
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,980
or do power poor it work pages were

366
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,400
notice anything to the fewer than he
would have on their so tooth

367
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,640
an enormously works at a five course use
um

368
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,890
weird things we know val these file
forces that

369
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:14,170
specially Word and Excel and PowerPoint
is that %uh

370
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,530
for single stings securely is merely
possible everyone is screwed up

371
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,590
I mean I think michael's at over 100
prizes for I'm

372
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:26,810
were for office party bugs a Apple's not
happen to them to win in these parsers

373
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,390
up so you know but just expose all-sec
surface 0 click

374
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,740
without user interaction that you're
exposing on

375
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:39,300
enormously large attack surface a where
you're bound to be many many books

376
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,840
a so we order North a difficult the to
parse

377
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,030
in fact that there's news consent is
very were some

378
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,370
um that's what the second one is that

379
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,750
these with these forces are I mean the
read-only says that they're more

380
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,780
conversions

381
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,350
so most of these basically get parsed
and then they get converted to HTML

382
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,020
on and what happens is they cover the
smell but they get rendered

383
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,430
in the current dong so that they too
will now become support the website that

384
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,840
hosts

385
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,880
on so any of these courses have I'm

386
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,470
process with the issues all the sudden
you know you use or

387
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,990
you have a um Excelsior what not that

388
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:21,830
allows you to have crossed that
scripting you know a website

389
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,150
um Israel Apple's API's

390
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,660
this is all in crock all the stuff
somebody full you can sort of

391
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,950
can't go to you got a few and say no I
don't want to support excel sheets

392
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,490
it's just not there um I think I mean if
it's all my fault that's fine did not

393
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,240
want to do it

394
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,030
but the fact that there's no feature
allows you to turn off

395
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,410
I find that were some on there's a few
water a

396
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,790
things in there from that they can do
for example

397
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:53,110
it will detect phone numbers and
tournament so this telephone your own

398
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,280
you click on them the phone comes of it
in

399
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,770
in the eye for you this particular
feature you can turn off

400
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,060
and if you don't if you don't need that
I would say turn it off

401
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,580
but that's the only one small thing in
the long list

402
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,590
the tax returns a eternal I'm

403
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:14,160
so the only cases because you can't rid
of them because somebody full

404
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,390
affiliation that I could come up with
this

405
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,510
to a render out of Prague to Knotts

406
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:24,360
use the WiFi so for example the Facebook
app as the which we gonna link

407
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,440
after all you are a few comes up which
is a browser

408
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,470
render stuff right and you have all the
sex service which is

409
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,700
within your own I'm I was up

410
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,480
I'm and so the the only gay sissy
there's

411
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,590
to not ran to not do that this if you
need to have a piece for XML

412
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,820
is to call out to Safari inlet so far in
her

413
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:49,900
I'm it doesn't fix any problem which is
sort of shifts to play

414
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,860
right so was going to exploit it um
we'll get to explore that they'll get to

415
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,220
exploit Safari and not your app

416
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,250
um it's not great but it's the best you
can do

417
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:04,450
I'm win with the iPhone has to offer you
that's why I least I think that's the

418
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:04,890
best thing

419
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:08,720
you on so it's already it doesn't fix
the problem but it sorta

420
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:15,720
says at least I want before I hope it
will be so far

421
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,190
on one summits fairly similar to

422
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:27,090
these these a the attack surfing the web
user

423
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:31,120
what they call you in which classes it
would you want to assess its already

424
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,590
it's a generally which class

425
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,050
in that it supports a very long list

426
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,310
um which is an internal parts all over
with

427
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,730
is clear to Lincoln for some including
all these

428
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,110
and then there some extensions to I'm
daughters

429
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:50,200
so these formats like exit and ICC will
force all the stuff to 44

430
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,090
something again that is enormous attack
surface

431
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,490
arm and there's no way to say

432
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,870
got you I was class and say hey going to
give you is a

433
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,910
is a thing filing you you should only
forces pink flower

434
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:07,900
I illiteracy you visited something and
say

435
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,210
suits being filed and really it's you
know bitmap file

436
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,340
where your ex we just happen to know but
there's a a bug in the bitmap portion

437
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:15,940
side over

438
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,420
I was sleepy eyes so that the problem
there is that the tax purposes way to

439
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,240
our to you

440
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,820
really want I've come up with to
possible

441
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,350
32 see to trade off it's all that's what
a wonderful

442
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:32,840
also there's no real 6 but I squat with
to work around tonight I think

443
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,020
you can do um so earnings UN which

444
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,080
all you do is to use on what they call
the

445
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,250
city in which reference which is that
cool graphics library to use

446
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,960
a equal graphics much more a cranial
where you can say

447
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,620
I'm or you know only open is typically
weakness P file

448
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,120
wheel from you know but not file if you
go to Grafton you say

449
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,290
open is a typical as a bitmap graphics
which would be a lot say

450
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,390
yeah I'm not doing that on so we could
do is I'm

451
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:06,820
you score graphics to open the image and
then you get a quote graphics

452
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,510
handle back in that handle you pass up
you are emitted annually which we use

453
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,080
that handle

454
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,080
I that's what are the ways to do it

455
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,190
it's a little bit effort because you
have to sort of I'm

456
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:21,430
do core graphics open the image to the
UAE with a

457
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:25,430
but it's not that which were I'm good
thing you can do is sort of

458
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:30,900
do your own nouvelle they simply passes
of the %um it's usually the way it works

459
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,670
for your which is

460
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:36,360
a you give it a week to piece it either
will be legal for XP city to ukraine

461
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,750
in his data um a object me

462
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:43,660
has an object you very much so you sort
of put in the 27 there were

463
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,290
you go fix today that you put in this
data and then before you

464
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:51,350
has it in a state of checked to %um it's
you go look at the first

465
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:55,480
a X number of fights the format with the
school the magic bites

466
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,910
and pretty much any file format and
certainly any image format first

467
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:04,650
X number of bytes tell you hey i'm
looking file he amity pick for him

468
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:09,390
if file so for example the the sadistic
hasn't quite come

469
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:12,940
the saudi if they so with these number
of bytes you can read pretty the answer

470
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,870
to pee file

471
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:17,450
source with these overflights you reap
reader for Secure Flight

472
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:21,540
the sort us a at least tried it closed
attack surface we say

473
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,730
know before hats off to You image at
least noted sipping file

474
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:29,690
not anything else I'm so it's a sort of
it's not really

475
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:33,800
a bucket toward you trying to closing
enormous attack surface

476
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:40,800
room when you things I

477
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:46,740
that was ther common addressee and
they're not this and I was cooking this

478
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,420
is pretty much

479
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,800
anything that uses any kind web services
and XML parsing

480
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,240
or protocol we sat next to a
back-and-forth I'm

481
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,430
could be a link to this up but i've seen
this in love I was that's well

482
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:03,530
but I'm in love I was as basically in up
being the sort of

483
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:07,650
lightweight client for web through the
middle where and quite often Girl Talk

484
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,770
XML picture

485
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,280
I'm in so you'll see these kind of
excellent exit tax where

486
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,430
I you ok he said the US and to the I was
client and you know it's fine expects

487
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,190
the username

488
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:21,080
or after you know whatever from there
and that it it take steps the to and

489
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,860
sends it back

490
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,930
after the service and then you know when
when

491
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:30,280
forming the request the exit server if
it gets to do proper escapee like this

492
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:30,870
so

493
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:34,300
untrusted either and also you get XML
injection

494
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:39,120
I return 0 hope that X 16 is depends on

495
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,210
what your political Dawson what
political 2001

496
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,510
it allows you to do I'm but it would
allow you to

497
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,700
risley exact you know it hope peace XML

498
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,610
I'm into the I'm X lobbying City

499
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,730
I'm equally the same thing for for it
civil heather's um

500
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,910
in this is actually quite come where
basically is the same to see prices were

501
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:03,690
ecclesia comes through as we discuss
which would consider a trusted

502
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,790
and then you send it back in some form
back to server

503
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:09,840
as an a they still had her its creator

504
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,950
and then you get to escapes things like
Exline and I would love to have

505
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:17,330
a header in Jax I'm again not I was
specific

506
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:22,470
I'm but its XE exceeded a in a lot I
what steps I think it would be useful

507
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:27,160
have have it in their up so basically
this is a a very simple therefore

508
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,480
you you extract file name: so we give
you an IOU

509
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,310
put on its injuries to be Heather a and
you know you see

510
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,770
take a file name: and there's no
escaping just

511
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:42,290
to do family for being put it in there
so I can give you a kiss

512
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:47,120
family risley could have come from the
clinton there and are fairly inject

513
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,770
SP others in and also content

514
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:54,050
I'm again depending upon what the
service um

515
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:57,100
actually supports this may or may not be

516
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,170
you know that or not right

517
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,240
milken's for the folks on the service
experts to you

518
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,850
on but this kinda Henry XO Texas rampant

519
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:10,480
more I was out um

520
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,850
there are a few good things so a
woodward's 2 a.m.

521
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,870
and rejection so I was has some a

522
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,650
you are all set set headers so if you
noticed form

523
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,650
for BW's the actual I'm a

524
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,720
API's and optics for a um

525
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,370
its creators I'm this in a way which is
you build up this Anissa

526
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,820
your request thread is readable your own
quest and there there are

527
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,950
or two methods on their add value and
set value

528
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,980
I basically you ago here hit a value

529
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,410
and it'll do felt they should have the
Kia value

530
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,890
so if it detects that there's an
exploding there um

531
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,970
it won't actually send it through to the
service/site

532
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:55,250
I'm novel projection IP address her I'm

533
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,690
I think it's okay it's not perfect in
the sense that

534
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,980
I'm Wendys a methods texts

535
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,800
a next line you'll feel silently
soldiers neckline there

536
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,360
it will to the new quest but it will be
voting 262

537
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,850
up so if you care about it feeling I'm
years we have to do your checks for that

538
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:17,010
also it's not doctor so it's kinda a
pain in the ass a

539
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,110
I mean this developer at the pretty
upset about this as security guy I'm

540
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:24,050
okay with it

541
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:28,910
room

542
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:32,450
one of the things I seeing other
incredibly common I was ups

543
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,480
on or formats reeboks um

544
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,120
and Inc this is pretty common to the
ceiling accepting

545
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,000
um is so westerlies that if you to
Dixies a strict successive see

546
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,320
and that which is this court for the
ticket see offer the open to

547
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,700
a classes in optics at the walls were
too low level stuff for you

548
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,410
if you stick to detect to see classes
and objects

549
00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:00,140
you were not gonna be horrible to stuff
like buffer overflows and things like

550
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,760
that

551
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,510
all these low-level a security issues
that you have

552
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,480
in C protect was ordered to check to see
if you stick to object to see

553
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,510
optics you can mostly a

554
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:15,900
avoid having any candles issues of
watching bugs were the exception where

555
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,840
you have these were

556
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,890
will have a memory corruption bugs a
that a

557
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:24,270
the above object to see doesn't really
offer golfer

558
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,550
for effect de cassis offers

559
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,680
for folks are themselves um

560
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,780
and I i think a reason wider solely for
single guys

561
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,790
in that sexy abs is because most
developers that

562
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:40,720
that enough reading ourselves don't have

563
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,560
a strict see back row probably come or
from the Web Services and without

564
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:49,220
you know what the right Java code or PHP
coder or maybe césar

565
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:53,260
and they did or not they don't know the
exact consequences for three bucks

566
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,550
were or forcing functions weirdest
suffix forcing

567
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:00,880
um functions and so is its you don't
know exactly which

568
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,700
while 46 which works in your gallery you
easily could have

569
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,450
for three bucks I'm

570
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,640
solves these forcing functions can lead
to 4-3 works

571
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,810
um in ever so I've got about 20

572
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:18,660
reviews I was abt and every single app
I've looked at as at least one form a

573
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,140
tree bark

574
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:23,310
I'm so the develop the I was up don't
seem

575
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:28,300
to know about fortune books %uh the four
or potentially horrible dixie with its

576
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,310
a or so yet the list here in this long
green

577
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:35,880
most common with any one of these if you
using the wrong way you have for three

578
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,370
bucks

579
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:40,640
up says subject is Dixie is

580
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,100
a superset you know it still supports
the sea Fox isn't

581
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,280
fourth functions you for deficit
reduction Africa

582
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,330
all those there um

583
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,510
so lingered about exporting is 43 bucks
I'm

584
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:57,410
usually when you format %uh where you
try to exploit for a chink Aug

585
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,500
you would take advantage of the percent
and I

586
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,360
a format specifier which is the one that
allows you to public order from the

587
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,179
stack and

588
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:07,390
and write some data to it I

589
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:11,399
that totally works for up for dole's for
these

590
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:14,510
a c4 functions it doesn't work for these

591
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,830
I'm because these are texts effect
before it functions

592
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:21,140
and format I'm specify parser

593
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,899
he's a dick to see functions doesn't
support person and so there's no person

594
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:25,590
and

595
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:29,200
on so when I stumble upon this in a sort
of found that there were all these 20

596
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,090
bucks they're

597
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:33,740
I was sort of wondering if there's no
precedent how bad is it

598
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,030
if you can actually rights to memory

599
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,760
what what can you still do i mean is so
possessive could leak memory

600
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:46,270
you could crash applications but you can
actually get code execution

601
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:49,770
at least that's what I thought and so
what it is so you can so the

602
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:53,330
Dixie documentation and they don't have
percent and but they did at a new

603
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,649
formats this article

604
00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:58,310
percent at sign and if you look at
description it says through

605
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,780
I'm percent thats I'm for a cease-fire
says

606
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,930
dick to see uptick printed as string
returned by

607
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:08,300
description with local matter it's
available or description

608
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,720
a with otherwise also works with see if
typeof

609
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,880
six returning result of the CFP
description

610
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,580
function a so what that basically means

611
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,680
is um if you clocks in at sign would

612
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,730
will do is it'll pop corn from the stack
you'll see it doesn't

613
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:30,109
in this optical call function pointer on
that in a softer

614
00:35:30,109 --> 00:35:34,240
so why not get person anymore um if you
don't get to write or crew

615
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,240
a really caissons when you get in return
is you get the call

616
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,240
or create function orders which is
equally bad

617
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,410
and maybe even a little bit worse
because you're at the Philo Subaru

618
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,330
member anymore

619
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:50,200
all you gotta do is basically be like
case you're call this function

620
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,590
um it's not exactly a simple as that

621
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:56,950
I mean it's almost that was that but
they're still supporting evolving

622
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:57,770
through

623
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,880
the some parts you know the soviet
Assault 60 I

624
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,820
its are circling notice I'm in the 'em

625
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,180
the I was and later so aside some simply
there which is a

626
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,570
until simply sort of see how easy it
really is

627
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:16,180
to do to exploit worries for three bucks
use exit at site

628
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,240
it's so easy rider no

629
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,870
I'm this I me very very very true

630
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,900
the a Dixie application we have the main
function

631
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,620
a heated argument and basically a I do
this

632
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:34,170
it is locked in here which is clearly
for over 43 work right

633
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:38,109
and in this commute act controlled and
you can you have a fourth-year a great

634
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:38,800
their

635
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,970
tonight runnin the burger and see what
comes out

636
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:45,830
the clearly you know you know like it

637
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:49,540
Reapers index which is the pop from the
stack rather was over there

638
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,790
at sign and then clearly you can see it
crashes on the Ozarks

639
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:57,560
success Texas to 82 first some pop
something from stack it for something

640
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,040
the crash not something

641
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,200
in of missus and a and then a

642
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,890
you're busy Crestor crassly 3x 6-2 6-2
6-2

643
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,380
68 so somewhere in there or something

644
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:12,450
and then as a when he got from six to
the six

645
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:16,900
to to a it to crash not something

646
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,840
a and I followed up on cities it's cool
it's very critical some record but i

647
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,180
wanna go over over

648
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,650
up the surf always knew some record in
basically the parsing

649
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,609
evolved as they did a good spot from the
stack and if you go to remove it

650
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:30,890
basically you enough

651
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:34,170
I'm that's basically this is the

652
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:37,310
review once you're inside particle this
a this optic

653
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:41,200
supporters a structure for a function
pointer a

654
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,700
and once you go there you end up in this
function where eventually

655
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,090
sucks when it gets extracted and he gets
call

656
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:52,600
that's it a this was all

657
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:57,440
in I i touch the stuff in the emulator
so I didn't actually fall so it's not

658
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:03,240
it's not are a but from all I can tell
is that things are or

659
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,800
fairly fairly similar in in armed and
the Roos

660
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,580
structures your pretty much the same so
the forces

661
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,630
a somewhere as well I

662
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,720
in it so that difficult to fill out
these things if through

663
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,880
built up a stake in a soft tech stuff
when I did all the stuff I so I sort of

664
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,660
said

665
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,420
you know try to from basically sort of
compact things in itself

666
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,780
very tape structure which

667
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,960
really is in this article it all for the
purpose of the school functions

668
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,870
Esq resembles an insult to close enough
the unit could excuse to

669
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:39,640
on it so it when I sir when it comes to
all these hoops I came up with this and

670
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,420
basically

671
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,250
if you if you have Ralf Rangnick with
for this and restrict see Conan

672
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:48,060
you fill out just really thought the
structure and pass it on

673
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:52,510
the other you public records from from
from the stack

674
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:56,060
up this should basically junk to

675
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,359
room the structural right here

676
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,880
on worthless I'm

677
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,350
K

678
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:10,440
a two-way forcing box and I'm

679
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,630
over so with this mention that for the
box is that if you subject to see

680
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:19,010
stick to the pixie up classes that your

681
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:22,910
mostly I'm avoid having all these memory
corruption looks like

682
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:26,440
a approvals and those kinda things I'm

683
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,020
and thats true except for one particular

684
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:33,190
a thing which is by the political and

685
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:37,010
Dixie is always great classes for stuff
like strings and integers and in all

686
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,790
sorts of things

687
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:41,890
but for by the the dole has his data

688
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:45,900
which is basically through a pointer to
classes here's a link here's a glove

689
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,240
data and that's it

690
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,370
right so if you end up reading were
reviewing

691
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:53,830
and I was application that handles
better data

692
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:57,570
you're kinda stock with that in you have
to fall back Seco

693
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:00,870
what you start back we'll see Korea all
these foreigners would sign outside

694
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,010
Insein

695
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:05,160
reporters today doesn't offset some
links indexes in there

696
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,450
nephew of these validation yourself and
yes we know for from

697
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,730
years ago bugsy MCSE of law school

698
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:16,050
is that this stuff is hard to do and
almost virtually everyone screws up by

699
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,270
people who having

700
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:21,280
in C in the same thing is true for
ourselves if you do

701
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,790
a I for handling in the pic to see you
after full-back see

702
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:30,180
yes you have to write see style I V for
hymns

703
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,760
in I haven't seen that many of them but
I see if you and there oh i mean they're

704
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,300
terrible

705
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,520
their riddled with bugs faces

706
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:43,670
so if you have to write a paper clip I
will try less be very very very careful

707
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:47,740
unworthy I guess I'm or issues that I
I've come across it again this isn't

708
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:51,380
I West specific uploaded effects I less

709
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,670
a is that you could have occurred
reversals are

710
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:59,430
II West has a %uh finally guys that are
quite similar to Mac OS X

711
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:04,490
and Steve I mean you're restricted the
sandbox but fast muscle filesystem

712
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:09,020
you know it it still records I are true
victory structure that you get to you

713
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:13,880
I'm in for I'm project to see there's a
class called in this farming

714
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:19,140
loves you too who you know reverse trick
reason or profile sickle cells as

715
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:22,790
for I'm this obviously

716
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:26,410
I'm classic reversal a I see if fuels

717
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:31,020
when using in the summit was recently if
you take a piece a user data

718
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,690
and you use that as a file name middle
son you use

719
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:38,370
does all size of its last reversible
bikini over a different file

720
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,700
reader/writer different file um and

721
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,839
they they they happen said the something
if you're

722
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:48,200
you are turning already you know asap
something you need to look at

723
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,810
Isaac personal I'm but what's really
kinda cute

724
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:57,690
about stuff is that I'm because using
Objective C and not really see

725
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:00,880
is that this administering in the
c-string or

726
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,900
not the same thing see Yahoo you can be
a little too for the new bike

727
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,940
so what that means is in a string is
basically it's a structure which says

728
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:12,030
points to a PC that says this is a
string as a

729
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,310
a link that says the screen is this long
I

730
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:18,900
missiles long as you start using
industry sees the a

731
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,530
objective-c classes a strings don't have
two people truly

732
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:26,500
thickens the a blob data that you do the
clear to be a string

733
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,390
I'm but when you do this with finding
your passing a string along

734
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:33,710
eventually go through objective-c

735
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:36,930
to some rap heard echoes the kernel
which is written in C Co

736
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:40,950
and the way that the way the crew works
is that it doesn't know about and string

737
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:44,250
just take get some a pointer data

738
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:48,580
and it goes up for the first two parts
fines and says that's the string curry

739
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:52,100
on so a object to CF's or

740
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,819
secretly horrible to push through a new
bites on when you

741
00:42:55,819 --> 00:43:00,310
trying to you a finely and so is so if
you take that the previous example

742
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:03,589
this one and then you go there you say
well

743
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:07,120
you know what we're gonna do is we're
gonna tag on dot extension so that

744
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,420
whatever you do

745
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,569
it has to have this extension and then
if you're the attacker is a go like okay

746
00:43:12,569 --> 00:43:13,460
that's fine

747
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,400
within as my last character in the the
file in

748
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,359
that I give you I put a new partner and
no part is fine for this

749
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,670
and a the strings in a string does not
care about you but at all

750
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:29,640
but once he gets passed on colonel bill
said no but and the trinkets text it's

751
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:29,940
the

752
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,990
texas goes away I'm so

753
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:38,250
a yeah and I was acts I'm you have to be
quite careful for was no button

754
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,720
when you're handling families

755
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:48,720
I'm

756
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,190
as a server last thing I i wanna a cover
is some

757
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:56,730
next to a parser a ordered the state ex
rel parser

758
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:00,150
um fry was aP's a

759
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:03,590
its cool in a sectional coarser it it's
not terribly

760
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:07,580
I it's a great secure as a predictor we
better I

761
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,170
where things it does by default handles
the tease which is kinda bear

762
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:15,010
and opens up you look to your left
attacks a

763
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:19,430
and there's no real way to turn off the
tee forcing in isn't great a

764
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:23,050
they don't resolve to run these by the
fourth which is good because we turn on

765
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:24,200
if you really want to

766
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,480
a so this is it's not great but any
better

767
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,530
um basically the way sort of did if you
if you handle

768
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:34,850
and rustic smell the way you fix that is
basically by

769
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:39,360
implementing ever did Colo you could
possibly have seal final move quickly as

770
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,000
I

771
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,220
to miss you this leader 6i physical or
they can find the way you

772
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,520
through work around this is you to clear
everything whatever

773
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,440
anything ever get called you just to
port go like I don't disinterest peace

774
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,090
XML

775
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:56,330
you doing the dirty I don't trust that
you don't feel right that's that's how

776
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,400
you fix it I'm

777
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,450
so it's not great it's here it's here
prone

778
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:04,530
up but it's not terrible leader I would
prefer to physics Milan

779
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:08,420
up supernatural we could say go to be to
use

780
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:13,380
it doesn't have to up but I mean 26 is
basically just think little ditty forces

781
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:17,450
and say you know at this the city for
circuits hit um

782
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:20,650
then we just feel room

783
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:24,110
yeah I think sometime which is I

784
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:27,600
went through slightly faster than or
this is it was for her

785
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:34,480
um it would have any questions well

786
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,490
than the thank you all for this thing
it's been a great talking here
