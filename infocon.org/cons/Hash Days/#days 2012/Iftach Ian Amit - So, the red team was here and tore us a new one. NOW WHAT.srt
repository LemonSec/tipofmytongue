1
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,510
welcome to the closing keynote that's
how I like to call it

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,630
sounds better than the last presentation
on the last day

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,750
thanks again stephan air appreciated

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,360
love you air we're going to talk about
defense

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,020
which is the very unsexy

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,550
for a lot of us and I did find that you
can make it a little

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,560
sorry or more interesting so to speak

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,449
and hence my next 45 or whatever minutes

9
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:38,960
that i'm gonna spend talking about it

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,670
this is me um not certified to do
anything

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,540
pretty a.m. I do the business thing

12
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,680
um for priority for under a mere
services

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,750
because I'm hacker

14
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,659
a researcher really really secure

15
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,930
programmer and I'm my stuff

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,820
only works on this machine so it's your
own protected and everything

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,100
and I do some research the

18
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,299
its cybercrime

19
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,020
and I which led me to do some research
on like how

20
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,280
big brother is is messing with with all
this in the past you can watch it on

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,039
YouTube or

22
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:26,950
and I run the local dive core group
university also here

23
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,530
in tel aviv actually set up with with a
buddy of mine almost two years ago

24
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,170
and again in a drunken rant we started
the PTS which is a and awesome

25
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,460
initiative to define what a proper
insertion testing is supposed to do

26
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,060
and be like you both for the customers
as well as for the service providers

27
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,609
which the should pick up on the wall

28
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:54,189
faster because most most I've Sox and in
the

29
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:58,030
spare time but I have from all this I

30
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,490
also do some reserve duty in the Israeli
Air Force doing

31
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,119
computer stuff and we're

32
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,229
obviously 30sec just probably them

33
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,410
the most important here on on the slide

34
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,909
so how did I get to talk about defense

35
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:19,159
its it's a funny story because I'm I'm
historically are mostly doing offensive

36
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:19,500
shit

37
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,190
am to you have

38
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,730
you know what you're running to
customers that had like a formal

39
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,400
assessment done

40
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,970
alright and the maybe even

41
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,519
contest is different and vulnerability
assessment I hope that everyone

42
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,739
on JustAnswer and they feel great about
it

43
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:43,220
because they can check of all those
compliance boxes

44
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,590
a room but it really doesn't give them
anything

45
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,250
in terms of security unfortunately
because if the look for compliance stuff

46
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,480
to get compliance with the

47
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,989
by far to do not get security and

48
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:59,629
on several occasions they actually had a
red team

49
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:03,110
engagement run with them am

50
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,530
and that could've turned the whole thing
around because the past pentecost

51
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,420
but after the red team's like did you
leave anything

52
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,829
not broken if am edit it

53
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:21,900
I get like a a scale of emotions from
customers that but go through that first

54
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,720
red like proper red team in a which
ranges from

55
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,879
like what the fuck to

56
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,150
now it's you know that was

57
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,379
I was that's not ours

58
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:40,750
it's like it's not my data right as it
can be can be my server that's not

59
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,829
responding its gonna cuz we have like

60
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:48,640
99.99 I'm up time right and there's like
fuck it's my server does not responding

61
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,209
is like everything is down yet did you
realize what

62
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,920
uses do air and things like

63
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,129
ok it was our scope its

64
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:02,209
you know its you did not play by the
rules this

65
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,219
you know this this can happen right

66
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:08,459
its not fair a

67
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,560
ends the last three phases like

68
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,390
while you know what that was awesome now
I understand where my gaps are between

69
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,859
my

70
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:20,190
card security posture and where I wanna
be in terms of risk management

71
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,580
and lets out a plan to solve it and and
obviously I can find the picture of the

72
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,450
person because

73
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,990
the yeah the wrinkle proving

74
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:34,160
unicorn obscured it and

75
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,870
having all this experience and having

76
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,050
the understanding that people don't know
how to really defend themselves

77
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,560
in let me to look into what are we doing
wrong

78
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,380
and this as an industry because
obviously we're doing something wrong no

79
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,200
I mean no one passes

80
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,599
you know a proper test on first time

81
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,010
and I'm like you know what let's start
with the corn stack of reports that you

82
00:04:59,010 --> 00:04:59,940
have behind you

83
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,160
third the state you know gathering dust
there of all those pen test

84
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,760
involuntarily assessments

85
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,330
that obviously you did not read or you
know because they're not worth anything

86
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,360
but let's try to find information that's
really useful

87
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,530
from there because you know you got a
good some credit to to all those people

88
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,960
that render

89
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,290
necessary and printed it a.m. some of
that stuff is actually

90
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,750
you know viable as as as a defensive
posture

91
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,180
but her to do that we need to understand
like set up some ground rules

92
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,930
all right let's start with the basics me
to define terminology

93
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,120
you cannot avoid it otherwise you're not
gonna get the budget and

94
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,450
people gonna just Diego a

95
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:43,260
so we are talking about five minutes
alright and then we're gonna go to

96
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,460
sexy stuff about volley Realty exposure
threat

97
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,030
and risk really quickly you can find
this week media

98
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,510
invulnerable deserve our ability alright
it's a gap it's it's a problem

99
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:59,240
it's usually related to software but if
you look really deeply into it

100
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,520
you'll find interesting stuff here

101
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,700
in logic and operational issues

102
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,920
processes procedures related to the
business

103
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,950
great that's vulnerability day a
cross-site scripting

104
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,990
on some obscure I don't give a fuck web
server

105
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,020
is not a follower Realty if I don't care
about it

106
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,080
as a business very I'll just ignore

107
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,170
but if something can break my business
process and impact my business

108
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,620
it's a vulnerability now I need to find
out how it's actually

109
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,760
defined to deal with it exposure

110
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,700
like do we just talk about the ability
no exposure

111
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,650
vulnerability can exist and it can exist
in kind of avoid

112
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,160
if it doesn't get exposed to a friend
actor

113
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,310
to someone who's actually like I'm gonna
break your business

114
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,740
a if you can't get if you can't see it

115
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,140
it's not exposed you need to understand
how your vulnerabilities fit into a

116
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,940
threat model

117
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,230
with your business your adversaries

118
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,240
a and what kinda interactions they have
between themselves

119
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,200
we talk about adversaries threats is
critical to define

120
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,240
you cannot just defend yourself from

121
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,160
everything the backpackers right
anonymous I love

122
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,390
how it's like all

123
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:25,740
we need to build a free call for
anonymous

124
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,280
sure a.m. I like usually define the
threats

125
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,690
by its capabilities and accessibility to
assets

126
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,090
right this is like the bare minimum you
can go deeper and and

127
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,250
break down to two more rather or
components but this is like the basic

128
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,120
stuff

129
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,330
a user-defined Fred community if you
cannot

130
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,820
pinpoint a specific agents are you
define for it agents

131
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,300
right we are three agents I'm afraid

132
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,740
a.m. you can define specific employees
there are potential for agents

133
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,230
right anonymous are a threat community

134
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,460
with china is the thread community I

135
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,060
but I usually like to narrowed down to
something a little more

136
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,180
manageable which leads us to risk

137
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,890
risk tell you little secret a.m.

138
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:20,180
is a mathematical think right for lack
of I'm not a trained

139
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,450
like effort this year relevant so it's a
thing it but it

140
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,670
it's something that can and should be
expressed

141
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,150
in a repeatable defensible manner

142
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:34,229
right think of it as an equation year
the classic ones or

143
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:38,310
probability well elective just pro
building something bad happening but

144
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,459
it's a probability

145
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:44,110
it's a number of some sort that you need
to deal with

146
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:49,009
in and measure over time so you can say
you know what my risk has been reduced

147
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:50,720
because I'm doing

148
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,560
things correctly or my risk stays the
same because I'm still buying shit and

149
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,699
you know I have legal rights but I don't
know what's going on

150
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:02,379
im so it's important to be able to
measure repeatedly

151
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:07,389
and track it over time done with the

152
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:10,430
terminology blacks a

153
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,750
let's talk about methodology so we've
seen that there's a problem

154
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,959
alright businesses are fragile that
their brutal whatever fragile the break

155
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:19,839
easily

156
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,019
%um mostly caused humans are involved

157
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:26,290
if you ask a good like network security
engineer

158
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,290
can you build me the most secure network
on on earth is like

159
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,660
yes stocks keep the humans out a bit
it's like

160
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,189
first use our own system everything's
broken

161
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:41,439
a room but the problems that we've been
doing defense

162
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:45,660
the same way for a very very very long
time

163
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,009
it might have worked back then

164
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:53,069
im and this is this is that the fender
view

165
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:56,269
and it still is the defender view even
these days we

166
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:59,300
we are very good in building walls

167
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,360
and and buying products and putting
stuff between

168
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,999
us in our threats that no more than

169
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:09,999
that they just make us feel better cause
I for big wall I have little flick to

170
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:10,569
take a look

171
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:14,110
and shoot arrows at over waivers calming

172
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,540
but the problem is those walls are
obscuring our view

173
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,220
ARV would health out there to attack me
cause after coming from

174
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,959
like their or their

175
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,269
I'm just seeing this so think of your
firewalls and antivirus is my peers as

176
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:30,420
my DS's as

177
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,839
these walls because or oh you're looking
at

178
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,990
is what's coming through with Lil Flip

179
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,410
you're missing out on the whole picture
and you're limiting yourself

180
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,629
we are limiting ourselves to only
dealing with the problems that

181
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:48,699
are well defined in like oh there you go

182
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:53,240
hers a virus I detected or by the way
and I just detected now but it's been

183
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,180
out there for like

184
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,490
six-month on your network so sorry

185
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,870
so by definition we're doing defense
really really badly

186
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,790
know if we take a look at the flip side

187
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,920
that I can view a little better

188
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,139
alright I can sit here and scope this
place

189
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:15,529
you know the the whole castle on a story
into and figure out

190
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:18,569
you know who's working there what are
the shifts of the guards when they go

191
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:20,509
out to the bar and get shitfaced

192
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:23,910
after eight hour shift or whatever it is
and see what's going on in the business

193
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,540
processes in the supply chain and

194
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,310
this is what we do as attackers alright
we'll look at this you know remotely

195
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:35,629
no one even notices of their I'm like
hiding in the woods here

196
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:39,490
and I know everything about the place
I'm gonna tap

197
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,839
before it even realize something's
happening right and once I attacked like

198
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:49,420
what has happened here

199
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,439
this is what we do as attackers again I
or shamelessly stolen this from from the

200
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:57,050
painters at this thing execution
standard it's basically what we do we

201
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:57,660
start with

202
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,550
Intel gathering move on to volatility
research

203
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,850
up until this stage 0 interaction with
the target

204
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,879
right I can do all that in my home lab

205
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:11,990
byproducts for steel downward whatever
it is research see exactly how their

206
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,990
work

207
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,420
here and then export

208
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,499
when I'm exploiting I know exactly
what's gonna happen because I've

209
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:22,600
I did this in the lab and I know the
process as I know the business I know

210
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,420
who's reacting to what

211
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,749
I know how the new I R and and

212
00:12:27,749 --> 00:12:30,809
and whatever it is take control

213
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:34,059
establish command control infrastructure

214
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:38,920
and then just do whatever I want still
they are growing organization

215
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,089
shut down the power whatever it is that
that makes me happy

216
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:46,559
that particular day now when I look at
her at it from a

217
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:52,009
defenders view we're really good at this

218
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:55,559
way way way too late in the process
we're not even detecting it

219
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:00,449
during the expedition were usually be
taking it like or you're fucked

220
00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:04,589
bleak liked a in were some of us are
really good at this

221
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:09,769
like you know forensics and learning
from how we got hacked

222
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:13,910
so I can put it in like a document and
say this will never happen again and it

223
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,230
won't

224
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,920
because I'm up to a new thing now if

225
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,149
right it really doesn't and companies
make a lot of money but by just doing

226
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:27,420
this this thing I called problems
choosing

227
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:32,670
it's like you got hacked I can do
phenomenal incident response and

228
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,519
like look up your you all for your fault
and help you fix their maybe

229
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,069
im but it doesn't really help you as a
defender to

230
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:45,480
to fend off the next attack this is what
we're missing

231
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,910
as defenders again the whole threat
modeling understanding what the hell

232
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,490
might

233
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,579
try to protect your into gathering

234
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:57,790
on myself howled how am i perceived from
outside by this community and that

235
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,059
community

236
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:03,389
right Intel gathering on my for
communities that I know they are

237
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:08,160
because I have a threat model right
water director capabilities

238
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,550
really research them and learn damn so I
can adapt and

239
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,259
to my defenses and be ready for to

240
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:18,879
in there a correlation this is what you
know all the fancy RC talks

241
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,069
about big there are are trying to to
deal with a.m.

242
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:26,699
worry we're getting better but it's it's
not

243
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,589
it's not we're not there yet we can't
just fro

244
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:33,720
all sorts of different date up to big

245
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,360
magic machine that will spit out like
this is what you need to do

246
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,519
but we're going there and

247
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,040
against a few tips as a defender it's
not about

248
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,970
egos there's you know Christian had a
had a great slide on his

249
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,259
opening keynote im about

250
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:56,119
hiring rock stars especially in defence

251
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:59,649
no point absolutely no point get the
juniors

252
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:03,910
teach them properly have them run
through a coherent process you'll get

253
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:07,069
we've erred defense than some Rockstar
seeing there in like

254
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:10,189
I'm gonna your toes binary to to pieces
and

255
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:14,519
understand exactly what that here to the
organization great

256
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,959
im so it's not about just egos and
people and skills it's about

257
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,550
a business great it were not

258
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:28,600
operating in the technical only
environment

259
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,920
people are leaving good but if call

260
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,529
this is not a technical problem right
this is not a technology should that we

261
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:39,740
can fix with the software and appliance
or server

262
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,899
this is a risk problem that a business
needs to deal with and we can help

263
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:48,929
all right we're part of the solution not
all of it

264
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:53,389
it's not fair an attacker will always
have more information

265
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:58,869
right the attacker usually have the
initiative they choose when to attack us

266
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:02,050
right so forget about fairness forget
about scope and

267
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:06,779
rules right because you're not gonna
play by the rules that your

268
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,939
trying to you know forces of to play
with

269
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:13,100
am about having mindset of improvement
of

270
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:18,619
this is tough this is basically
understanding were always going to be

271
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:21,660
a step behind or not not release the
behind but

272
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,869
we're always going to have gaps and it's
always going to be about

273
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:28,360
closing those gaps those gaps can be you
know in technology

274
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,939
right but they can also be in processes
and people and

275
00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:36,240
understanding and com company culture

276
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,740
but you need to identify them you know
to realize what the gap years and then

277
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,059
close its in the context of the risk
again

278
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:47,920
don't just got patching servers left and
right because

279
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,429
there's a new home in Apache and you
have like five of them on some internal

280
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:54,119
segment that no one gives a shit about

281
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:57,339
right it's not just the technology
should just understanding what's the

282
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:58,160
risk

283
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,319
context so

284
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:04,880
let's go for it solve that the
methodology again in details

285
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,220
start a mapping yes Chris use the same
thing

286
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,270
we really suck at mapping right

287
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,410
we've you know it's it's it's it's an
arts

288
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,089
that's been developed for years and it
still were were still coming

289
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:23,350
getting there but when we're talking
about mapping

290
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,790
threat as a business

291
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:31,700
we're not there yet guy mapping is
difficult you need to identify what the

292
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,370
business

293
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,200
is doing right you could be working as a

294
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,040
system security engineer one company

295
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,190
and someone else is gonna have the same
John Thailand mother company

296
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:48,080
completely different drops cause you're
protecting different businesses

297
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,160
first I want to say what the business is
doing how it's making money

298
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,080
tough questions right for for security
hackers like what gimme gimme shock me

299
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,940
for web app up no it's bullshit

300
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,430
understand who are you working for who's
paying your paycheck

301
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,810
how did they do that unbelievable the
keeping us

302
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:12,760
you know of how did you do that how they
make money

303
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,980
understand that process because that's
what you need to protect

304
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,430
otherwise no pity for you

305
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,920
understand what are the processes the
assets to people are involved in this

306
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,460
making money thing for that business and
then

307
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,000
figure out alright so there's some
technology from around here yeah but

308
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,540
I could feel good with that because I'm
I know technology

309
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,000
third parties right we offer a lot of
stuff

310
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,630
outsource a lot of stuff how does that
fit into our model

311
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:45,970
am and then map the security elements
that we have an intelligent elements on

312
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,210
top of that

313
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:52,770
now you can start mapping actual
exposures

314
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,120
right and issues and vulnerabilities to
be talked about before

315
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,310
im there's no you know this is the Bible
love mapping and threat modeling

316
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:06,200
right it can cop in any shape or form it
can be a document give you video can be

317
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,330
whiteboard session right that that you
sit down with with a few eggs accent and

318
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,750
a few

319
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,020
business line or ours and product
managers and whatever it is

320
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,650
and talk about things how do you make
money how the week ship products how do

321
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,300
we provide services

322
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,200
worse information who's dealing with
that and map it out

323
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,670
so I can understand how this this whole
thing works

324
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,740
and you can break it out you can't even
take a you know huge companies like GE

325
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,150
or BOINC

326
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,230
they're usually like yeah we can do that
we have hundreds have business lines and

327
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,110
product like

328
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,910
okay so break it down take 200 and sit
with them one by one

329
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,050
and you have small many maps and then go
to the

330
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:51,390
executives ask them so how does this
business

331
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,440
related this business 0 so its it's just
a bit it's math

332
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,980
again it's breaking down cover dividing
quark or

333
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,620
understand how how things are connected
it's doable

334
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,990
right I'd love it when you go to liken
multi-billion dollar organization of

335
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,130
yeah you can't do that you could have
set up like hundreds of interviews on

336
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:10,590
ICT

337
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,010
okay if my calendar

338
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,770
here's why people here's her people
let's make them

339
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,110
it start because if you don't start your
to have a good finish

340
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,920
am and once you have a map you can't you
can figure out right so that this is

341
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,040
back the process is there I got some
input here this is something called you

342
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,070
over fear and

343
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,170
you know that connecting us to someone
else

344
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:35,540
it there's a vulnerability here in this
data

345
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,230
right there's an issue with this third
party or human that's feeding data and

346
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,540
its

347
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,100
it's a problem I did identified it right

348
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,220
a this input is a critical asset

349
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,780
I identified so I know I need to protect
it this person

350
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,470
is a critical asset because it's his
part of this process that makes

351
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,510
money magically identify love those

352
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:03,730
processes people technology in order to
be able to say or you know what I'm

353
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,290
gonna focus on

354
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:09,330
this and this and this when I'm trying
to figure out

355
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:13,240
you know how to protect this process
that makes me money

356
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,690
instead of just let's install a vis all
over the place

357
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,800
and firewalls mids isn't blinking lights
and

358
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,070
im lots of dollars youths

359
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:28,170
useless the map the frets

360
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,700
and we always talk about this who am i
up against

361
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,620
former adversaries could be partners
could be business rivals

362
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,180
could be China who is it

363
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,790
ask the people who run the business
they'll be able to tell you

364
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:46,980
that's their job right they're not
managing some firewall

365
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,210
their managing risk for the business and
risk comes from

366
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,070
external or internal parliament's that
might fuck up a business

367
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,380
asked them they know what's map it out
so you can understand and do some

368
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,600
research on their capabilities

369
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,910
how do they affect me use the cleaning
lady

370
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:06,060
and Metasploit expert probably not

371
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,410
right okay

372
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,950
so that that's that's that's a threat
capability that I can map into my

373
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,930
risk analysis right what do they know
what's the emo

374
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,410
cleaning lady comply again this this big
ass it's not here

375
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,650
USB thing and first infect machines like
a shame cause someone told her

376
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,740
right that's for capability that's her
camel in it

377
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,560
China artist dealership products with
backdoors

378
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,950
thats r-mo whatever is identified so you
can react to it we can respond to it

379
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:40,710
and you have all that data in human form
in

380
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:45,220
brain Thompson logs that you're
collecting we're not collecting

381
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,940
collect everything document everything
find a process is to get all the

382
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,940
information so you can process it later

383
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,060
and and it's about measure twice and cut
what's

384
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,440
don't filter logs just because they take
up space

385
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,090
spaces cheap right big data requires big

386
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,950
storage fun you know

387
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,950
pieces of information that you think now
that are real irrelevant

388
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,000
once you have something going on
incidents or or some kind of threat

389
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,460
forming up

390
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,730
may be crucial to your understanding of
how do I deal with this because things

391
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,260
correlates

392
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:28,750
in not just in a given point of time be
correlate overtime

393
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,100
right and it's important to collect all
those pieces they overtime in

394
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:37,100
and figure out a way how they crew the
story

395
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,200
get intelligence from every were

396
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,910
your marketing guys yourselves nizar
business biz dev guys

397
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:48,920
are outward facing that's a huge
advantage talk to them

398
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,420
in trying to get information on again
the threat landscape was out there to

399
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,450
get us what

400
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:59,860
are our plans right were we talking to
what our people asking you

401
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,230
right this is the kind of information
that you need to because now you know

402
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,960
that people are asking about our

403
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,380
next product line which is still sick
wit or

404
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:13,950
never gonna come up because can develop
it or whatever it is

405
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,810
look at your competitors what are they
doing talk to them

406
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:22,050
you'll be surprised to find that there
are a lot of channels that you can

407
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:27,450
create on the risk side and I just came
back from from like three days in London

408
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,880
visiting a nice like industry
organization called or X operational

409
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,150
risk exchange

410
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,190
for anyone here is working for the
financial sector

411
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,380
you might know about it these are people
from competing banks

412
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,140
right all the risk managers Dept have
this platform that they share risk

413
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,340
information this is phenomenal

414
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:50,050
right we're doing that on the you know
AV industry

415
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:54,150
vendors will will tier 1 each other on
all the sales

416
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:58,680
engagement while the researchers are
collaborating insuring samples and

417
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,190
information and analysis

418
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:06,010
find a way to talk your competitors its
valuable information it's phenomenal

419
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:10,740
customers partners analysts right talk
to people who kind of try to understand

420
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,390
your

421
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:14,900
your markets certs

422
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,980
market news everything is relevant right
even

423
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,240
you know just events around the world

424
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,810
or local you often see that there's a
correlation between the kinds of attacks

425
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,740
that you need to deal with or

426
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,490
incidents that you need to deal with
with what's going on

427
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:37,630
right sports events usually lead to
spamming of like all take out this

428
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:41,990
NCAA whatever this football soccer

429
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:45,710
baseball ongoing someone else on

430
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,590
marrying his girlfriend or whatever it
is people will click that

431
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:56,590
of it happens

432
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,480
look for look for early warning sign
again it's the kind of information that

433
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,890
you have

434
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:06,750
but you need to be able to identify
right and not just ignore or react to

435
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,080
the symptoms

436
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,230
right you need to figure out what it
means if there's a

437
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,400
you know if the call volume 2

438
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,810
IT Support Center is is rising right

439
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:22,410
if PCs are behaving really if there's
construction going on across the street

440
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:22,930
that

441
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:27,210
was not supposed to happen right is
someone actually like digging up my at

442
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,280
my communication lines

443
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,460
or is it really like you know the city
needs to fix a

444
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,860
a hole in the in the ground or ask

445
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:42,860
figure out what's what's weird

446
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:47,400
number why I told you this is our
biggest problem security wise

447
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,200
there is no fix for for those playing

448
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,590
but their processes were we can minimize

449
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:59,360
the damage if K if people realize

450
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,830
what this means and how this can be used
as an attack vector

451
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:09,060
bill be a little more aware about this
smokers are about

452
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:14,210
smoking will kill you air they'll be
aware of those kind of things that

453
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:17,250
that happen in at least be able to say

454
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,320
Hey Dude Meissen stupid but I just

455
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,530
you know someone's tailgating or used it
is

456
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:28,590
dude hang out in you know and and the
smokers area his bats looks funny

457
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:33,090
or doesn't have a batch I don't know
right might be something that

458
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:37,660
will actually help you deal with with
people like me

459
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:41,190
they correlate this is this is the hard
part

460
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:45,970
corley everything all the things all the
raw logs that we talked about before

461
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,680
right all the information that we
gathered from the business from our

462
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,000
marketing guys from

463
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,680
from from the product managers and the
business mine owners

464
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:59,040
all the news they're going on regional
sports entertainment financial

465
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,210
industry related correlate

466
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:06,250
everything all the time overtime

467
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:10,040
try to find the stories try to find the
trends

468
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,240
right that speak to your threat model
that connect your threat mall to

469
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,870
identify if things are going to happen

470
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:20,570
right and instead of just sitting there
in waiting for the blinking light to

471
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,790
tell you that you've been gone for six
months

472
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:26,650
try to to be a little more proactive
about it and kind of do something before

473
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,160
it actually happens

474
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,420
and then once you get all that homework
done and this is hard work this is not

475
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,330
easy

476
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:37,760
a then you can start defending yourself

477
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,440
right train people to identify report
and reacts to

478
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,180
those basic elements of we talked about
not just reacts to breaches

479
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,760
but reacts to signs of should gonna
happen

480
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,490
alright some something is in the air
right that that's we're gonna get

481
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,580
attacked or

482
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,190
someone's poking my my external servers
is looking for information because

483
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,790
the point try to do something

484
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:05,040
get the technology last not first

485
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,630
right don't just start by Chip thats
just hold of that

486
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,860
amex its you'll be fine I'll give you a
chance to buy

487
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:16,220
good stuff the homework first and then
figure out

488
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:22,920
were what do you need to protect the
assets of talk about

489
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,070
most importantly have a clear picture of

490
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:30,390
were we rocked right number does gap to
talk about that this

491
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,610
you know mentality of constant
development you have to

492
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:37,010
map outright I'm here I need to be here

493
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:42,210
right a I need to assess myself to see
exactly what those gaps are

494
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,790
so either get someone to do the testing
for you do it yourself

495
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,510
whatever day is get the unicorns 22 send
your report

496
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:52,660
but get a decent evaluation of where
you're at

497
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,760
to can measure it over time no I'm not
trying to stop in Tustin Karen from cell

498
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,580
understand again yes like yourself

499
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,930
is gonna make feel better well a view
you know

500
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,630
like an unprotected thats awesome the
wake up tomorrow

501
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:13,730
and everything's broken so I can help

502
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,900
talk about sconce and development look
for changes

503
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,430
never this this is critical right take a
picture of the slide

504
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:25,640
never sign of on a strategy document on
like it

505
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,800
this is our defenses security defensive
strategy document

506
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,100
both five minutes later it's irrelevant

507
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,320
ever framework that you can work with
right that adaptable because your

508
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,750
business changes

509
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,940
because tomorrow we're we're having a
new business line with like

510
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,850
shitloads of third parties coming in and
talking to us and were buying libraries

511
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:45,670
from from

512
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,710
some Chinese a software developer and
and get all the

513
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,220
I haven't def shopping India that
integrating all those libraries and our

514
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,350
code

515
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:58,090
the Coro where does that fit in or
security strategy

516
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,110
it doesn't okay

517
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:05,230
never sign of something that that is
never gonna

518
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,330
stay stable alright in remember we're
here to support

519
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:13,410
the business we're not here to to buy
fancy gadgets and into

520
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:17,540
to have like fancy screens with rights
on them in

521
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:21,970
AV and firewall stuff going on

522
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:26,420
when artworks once you get the basic
starting you have a strategy

523
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,880
or framework for strategy and you start
doing stuff sherrit

524
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,920
or at least see what others are doing if
they're doing it right obviously

525
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,400
even if they don't learn from their
mistakes

526
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,180
cue track of what's going on outside
your this is your research on

527
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,570
your adversaries what today no what's
new in out there

528
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:50,470
is it relevant to me or not

529
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:55,120
audits are great to keep the lawyers of
your ass

530
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,570
thats its okay it has nothing to do

531
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:03,560
with security yeah I'm not a CSS piece I
can't compare and like give you all the

532
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,660
pillars shipping

533
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,740
and sable but yeah its

534
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:12,190
it's got nothing to do with security its
court fancy ill get the auditors the the

535
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,400
accountants and the lawyers of your ass
here's

536
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,940
checker

537
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,550
if you are compliant that's again that's
great keep

538
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:28,080
lloyd Doggett there's a risk you know in
terms of legal and regulatory in

539
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,230
whatever it is

540
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:33,130
a.m. you can solve that and that's great
if you're

541
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,530
if you're compliant but you for just
compliant

542
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:40,230
using usually not helping

543
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:44,930
because now you have proven to yourself
and announced to the rest of the world

544
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:49,870
that you are as good as the lowest
common denominator in your industry

545
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:54,350
yea bureaucracy of of

546
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:58,280
and you are doing exactly what everyone
else is doing at the bear as a bare

547
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,140
minimum

548
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,970
okay so everyone knows that this is your
the order measures

549
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:10,320
ok so now I can exploit it I can bypass
because you've got nothing else

550
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,960
Mia it's not about technology or skill
or people

551
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,240
its really about thus this cat herding

552
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,710
kinda drilled that we're doing and
trying to figure out how the day all

553
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,930
mixed together in this business

554
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:27,460
that's I'm trying to have everyone

555
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:33,060
like work together and be be happy

556
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,260
at that point if you follow thus and and
you

557
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:40,420
have or like okay make Skype com make
sense and you're kind of a douche

558
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,740
idiot whatever speaking here but

559
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,180
II convicts all that stuff am then you
can get to the more interesting stuff

560
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,970
and this is where it gets really sexy

561
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:54,380
when I talk about until gathering you
can go wrong out there

562
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:58,140
and really get some information on your
adversaries

563
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,900
information that he's super relevant to
how you do things

564
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,050
defensively and stop their tax

565
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:08,619
from happening before it actually
happened crazy right

566
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:12,399
but its actually Park am

567
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,069
the the secret its information

568
00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:21,049
you Hornets you I'll if this is your
playing field and you're just standing

569
00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:23,089
here

570
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:26,960
wake a good hit me

571
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,230
no this you owned this you know what's
going on

572
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,119
right you can set traps and and and get
information from

573
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:38,549
all around the place that's actually
relevant you're not just gonna sit

574
00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:42,980
sit here like I close my eyes and Brits

575
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,079
this is what we're doing if I see you
running at me

576
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,069
with a baseball bat unlike I think I
could deal with that

577
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:53,740
I can either run the fuck out of

578
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,730
or shoot you of alright

579
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:02,049
or get a stake in and get ready to fight
this it's pointless to just sit there

580
00:35:02,049 --> 00:35:04,329
like

581
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:07,710
I'll be fine right this is

582
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:11,200
this is the way of thinking that that
I'm trying to to set your

583
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,940
a.m. set traps intelligence traps
technology traps talk about and see how

584
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,930
it works

585
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:21,109
and and you can actually booby trap shit
like when people

586
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:24,930
that are attacking you are going to use
thanks to attack you

587
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:28,220
but the boy gonna Boyd interfaces 6

588
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,740
if we're gonna at school

589
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,720
at that that's awesome am

590
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:41,660
not a lawyer so get proper legal advice
because this shit can get really really

591
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,210
scary really fast

592
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,829
a.m. but get a good lawyer not the
comment that

593
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:51,140
that goes off no you can't do that but
the kind that goes not you can't do that

594
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,480
here but set up this company over there

595
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,640
and they hire someone else and the I
mean

596
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,670
I don't know what this is what's
happening but

597
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:06,730
nope some district on something and
broke his face

598
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:10,569
he was after you about just ripped I
don't know what happened

599
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:13,769
air yeah get those car lawyers

600
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:17,369
couple of examples to come see how that
works in in real life I get this this

601
00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:20,950
actually works this is not me to stand
here

602
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:24,710
telling stories am so first example

603
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:28,410
this is kind of the scenario we
identified for the agents

604
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:31,670
right for Communities and and we we saw
order

605
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:35,210
their hangouts were right so would get
the tools or get information

606
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:39,359
ordered like practicing and developing
offensive

607
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,730
stuff because we you all do when we know
how that works

608
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:47,849
air we got into the group a.m. in this
specific case it was a form

609
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:50,890
in startling manipulating stuff for

610
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:54,849
for lack of better technical terms a we
back toward its

611
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:58,390
so we'll know if someone who is using
some think we'll on a flight

612
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:01,789
okay good to know and

613
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:04,799
make sure it leaves a the sting
signature so

614
00:37:04,799 --> 00:37:08,460
when something does happen and his son
to us

615
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,190
I'm gonna be like oh I know thats I know
where that came from

616
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:15,519
I know what's good what that's going to
do right I know who's using it

617
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:18,910
where he got it from a cool right this
is

618
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:23,130
this is proper defense not like you been
owned

619
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,670
a.m. again a pic of the signatures
kickback

620
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:30,700
what's the fun so here's here's the deal
and this is the four

621
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,990
that they were hanging out with a.m.

622
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,880
call hacker form a and someone was
publishing and you

623
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,150
wrapped great school then the rappers
and

624
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:45,380
022 whatever it is Baba works on all all
kinds of stuff

625
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:49,200
does things processes 100 percent

626
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,430
undetectable in working on Windows 7 XP
& Vista

627
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:57,519
whatever a back channels runs on IRC

628
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:01,890
still all kinds of information from
Pigeon Firefox and

629
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:05,619
its got at my school we it easy to use
and

630
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:08,749
that this is from the actual post this
is not my stuff so

631
00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:15,749
am Mike you know what

632
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:19,660
I can use deaths to

633
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,700
I can used aP's in wrapped

634
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,670
right because if you

635
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:32,240
you know that works and and I i have the
actual example in a second

636
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,380
am for for this specific 1i I can sure
exactly what we do because it's like for

637
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,980
for all customer that was doing some
stuff air

638
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,700
but with another chance army after be
the first to like

639
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,670
that's kinda fun a rum and not too long
ago

640
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:51,549
everyone is familiar with

641
00:38:51,549 --> 00:38:57,210
bark comment right yes no

642
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:01,309
awesome so the comment solely stopped

643
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:05,880
like a few months ago though were
virgins and actually pulled off the

644
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,190
website because

645
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,680
darco terms like shit series are using
this to

646
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,349
like attacked their own people like
kinda sucks

647
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:18,150
does make me feel good dropped website
and

648
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,599
I would like shit what happened now

649
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,069
because people go like I want or Colbert
I want to comment like

650
00:39:25,069 --> 00:39:28,259
okay I could give it our common to have
the latest version as I

651
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:31,670
I still have it what if I publish it

652
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,140
in this forum like to hear the whispers
in the dark army but all the other

653
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,670
website is down

654
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:41,880
their ego but it's gonna be like on my
terms

655
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,869
so here's what we did in in the second
instance and the second actually show

656
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:46,569
because it's

657
00:39:46,569 --> 00:39:49,680
kind of generic at Starcom it's not like
specific

658
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,249
whatever and I'm so this is our comments
and running

659
00:39:54,249 --> 00:40:00,170
everything's cool was a fresh the latest
version if you want I can give you want

660
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:05,869
ok really a.m.

661
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:09,519
soco it's running of come on just

662
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:14,789
go go go and what we're doing is we're
using the tools there are distributed

663
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:16,249
with our Commenting this

664
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:19,720
in this instance solicited by either
which basically takes two batteries or

665
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,869
any number of files

666
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:25,509
and puts them glue them together

667
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:28,799
strings them together so they execute
warm after another

668
00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:32,890
it's what we're doing is we're taking
like a simple stupid interpreter

669
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:37,309
shell right a that we compiled for

670
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:40,599
for Windows and running it before

671
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:44,880
running dark comet itself were updating
icon so it would look

672
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,170
like dark on its air am

673
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:52,400
and we're saving it is as dark comet to

674
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,890
or underscore or whatever it is so it's
dark comet

675
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:59,329
and dark comet order comment with
interpreter or whatever you want you can

676
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:00,150
actually

677
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:03,739
build you know the the server of dark
Ahmet

678
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:06,789
and bind its to the client

679
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:09,789
which is kinda also because it's there
anyway be

680
00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:13,519
right and we're

681
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:16,789
we have liked the after listener on over
there

682
00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:20,460
we're running this resolved our comment
and our comment box up

683
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,569
everything's fine it's fully functional
operational

684
00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:27,910
love up cuz its star card but on

685
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:31,319
back and we have a connection from the

686
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:34,559
person who's using our comment to attack
us

687
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,239
so all have to do now is just this is
like a past all have to do

688
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:42,299
with the original da comment rename mine
too dark comet repackage it

689
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:47,400
put it on forum and wat for shelf

690
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,049
always fun

691
00:41:51,049 --> 00:41:54,529
got up go easy for

692
00:41:54,529 --> 00:41:58,599
talk tomorrow or right it's old and it's
all the cool thing about its like

693
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:02,440
click click click click click click your
own

694
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:07,119
and you old yourself you're never gonna
run a navy on birthright

695
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:11,440
of fix yeah it's got a Trojan it

696
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,160
really tell me something I don't know
for

697
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,759
run in any way

698
00:42:21,759 --> 00:42:25,390
it's the people its to humans that unit
immediately not

699
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:29,380
if there's a in our example a.m.

700
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,579
keylogger dat that we we modified

701
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:37,329
and this one really goes deep and this
is equipped her father whatever you

702
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:40,730
wanna call it this is basically taking
although it should but you becomes old

703
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:41,989
are comet that and

704
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:47,549
is detected by everyone encrypt at soda
and versus won't be able to detect

705
00:42:47,549 --> 00:42:50,910
right and then the great like a funky
binary that that ransom everything

706
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:54,019
is fine and and those things are a
really cool

707
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:57,759
right because that they actually work
and I'll and verses have been out there

708
00:42:57,759 --> 00:42:58,579
for like what

709
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:01,910
for years twenty years still think that
the ship

710
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:06,200
am you can you can buy it you can
download it whatever it is

711
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,440
in this case this dude was publishing
the stall in

712
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,150
again if this is an hour for that that
we're monitoring because our

713
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:17,369
you know threat communities were in out
there and getting

714
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:21,619
their sister dermo together am this is a
lie

715
00:43:21,619 --> 00:43:24,799
right it wasn't 100 percent fought

716
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:28,499
it actually trigger 23 Antivirus is some
obscure

717
00:43:28,499 --> 00:43:32,369
once and the usual you like 100 percent
false positive

718
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:35,809
once that if you don't calculate of
about mars

719
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:39,239
I so what we did here as

720
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:45,210
we can download it right a so we
download it

721
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:48,529
and modified

722
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:53,170
with it a couple things there one is
first we'll fix it

723
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:56,880
because it wasn't 100 percent for and we
really what I mean you do the testing it

724
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,140
when you run this

725
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,190
like I'm gonna run this on this this
this and this movie

726
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:05,970
modern bar stool a and you know if
something pops up like a

727
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:09,640
crap not going to use it so we want
people to use it because

728
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,569
so we had to fix it a so that was that
was interesting

729
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:19,160
and and the second part is yes we're
gonna create some kinda fresh binary

730
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,940
that someone's for probably putting an
excuse to a trojan or some have

731
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,190
now we're and in its gonna be
undetectable right

732
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:30,809
well not if I control the way that it's
created

733
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:34,599
so what I'm gonna do is put my signature
in its gonna be

734
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:38,480
better be fucking static I don't care no
one's gonna look into it

735
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,940
into my defense systems to look for that
signature

736
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,710
finally signature-based detection works

737
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:49,329
right i'd in the thick of it

738
00:44:49,329 --> 00:44:53,279
like before so here's here's a this is
this really is

739
00:44:53,279 --> 00:44:57,039
is like a generic example cuz we week
really

740
00:44:57,039 --> 00:44:59,910
couldn't show you exactly what with
their especially not on the fighting

741
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,099
part but that's not

742
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:04,970
rocket science trust me im so this is ro
critter

743
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:08,109
and I was actually used by by

744
00:45:08,109 --> 00:45:11,869
someone else but in the different story

745
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:17,839
and work for Pink Party right and

746
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:22,410
so this is the crib that version I run
it it works like charm it's just

747
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:26,499
black binary different than party itself
because it's

748
00:45:26,499 --> 00:45:30,589
it's different this is the red one that
we've modified

749
00:45:30,589 --> 00:45:34,779
right and it works kinda the same I

750
00:45:34,779 --> 00:45:38,239
what we're looking at here as

751
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:41,239
for

752
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:44,900
Mike ok past go down

753
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:48,989
30 we'd designed it so that it would

754
00:45:48,989 --> 00:45:52,670
once it creates the execute a ball find
a cold cave its section of the code

755
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:53,529
that's like all

756
00:45:53,529 --> 00:45:58,200
dolls and whatever and we just made it

757
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,650
so it would leave a signature in this
case I'm right here

758
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:05,829
okay this code insider the buyer is
never gonna run

759
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:09,779
because there's you're just doesn't get
reference and if you wanna go like super

760
00:46:09,779 --> 00:46:10,460
cool just

761
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,599
just create a jumper for a total the cop

762
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,759
so if something points to some around it
like

763
00:46:17,759 --> 00:46:21,630
don't get executed a I get this is how
it looks like in memory

764
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,859
in would when you look at the Cebu Fred

765
00:46:24,859 --> 00:46:27,910
it's just like they're in some portion
of the code

766
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:31,140
like good now

767
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:34,230
that's make it fairly easy to detect

768
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:38,900
correct cause all I have to do now is go
to snort

769
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:42,119
and have a signature for this

770
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:46,259
i right here on the binary

771
00:46:46,259 --> 00:46:50,160
what we're doing here in in terms of the
demo were downloading or or

772
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,400
I'm just to generate traffic right so
I'm um

773
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,619
I'm getting the the original cryptid
like proper created

774
00:46:57,619 --> 00:47:00,650
before I modified it from from like two

775
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:04,599
vanilla version and then I'm downloading

776
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:08,690
the rig version just so I have P cap
Soave both of those things running

777
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:09,720
through

778
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,460
the wire

779
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:17,220
exc this

780
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,869
and alright so what I have here is my
snorting Chur

781
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:24,599
right super simple Tony to be a reverse
or

782
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:28,160
anything like that

783
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,109
running the the peak amps

784
00:47:32,109 --> 00:47:36,559
probable law on snort

785
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,650
this is the regional so

786
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:43,599
nothing is is popped up so this this is
this is what would happen if I just

787
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,680
use the critter that the two published
now

788
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:51,319
if I is my version ove of the critter

789
00:47:51,319 --> 00:47:54,650
a dollar simple right that's cool

790
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:57,779
because now I know someone sending this

791
00:47:57,779 --> 00:48:01,420
you know someone's using this tool
against me

792
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,450
something relevant for my ideas and all
we we've been through too I just talked

793
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:08,630
today

794
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:12,970
it can be useful for something I crazy

795
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:16,470
am I get there all we had to do it that
point is just

796
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:22,539
go back to forum and yes we had that
dudes like pat

797
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:25,839
someone told us or we guessed the the
password for the

798
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,920
the guy posting the toll it so

799
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,119
all we have to do is go back post change
it upload it to a new mediafire

800
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,819
your Realtor into euro and everyone was
there or the corset

801
00:48:36,819 --> 00:48:43,440
a.m. again you you've narrowed it down
to a certain community that you know

802
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,259
hear about people okay so

803
00:48:47,259 --> 00:48:51,720
relevant actionable intelligence

804
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,039
again I can't stress this hard enough

805
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,729
capital border a but remember that law
is

806
00:48:58,729 --> 00:49:02,690
also hackable because law was created by

807
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:06,739
former abilities by humans they didn't
cover everything or

808
00:49:06,739 --> 00:49:09,829
persists it was a vote polls im

809
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:13,380
you can get stuff done look at Microsoft
Microsoft has the

810
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,499
Best Lawyers in the world born on

811
00:49:16,499 --> 00:49:19,979
air their lawyers let them touch

812
00:49:19,979 --> 00:49:23,099
modify millions of PCs

813
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:26,220
live PCs that were infected with a

814
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,749
real relapse your

815
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:34,739
on copyright infringement on trademark
infringement

816
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:37,970
how was their claws that let them

817
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:42,829
patch billions of systems and Papa
message to the users like

818
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:46,470
we clean up your shit that's awesome

819
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:50,749
am again use it to your advantage find

820
00:49:50,749 --> 00:49:54,589
the lawyers that will let you do what
you need to do to get

821
00:49:54,589 --> 00:49:59,069
proper defense right once you do that
again you can throw in some more

822
00:49:59,069 --> 00:50:00,410
technology the same

823
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:03,869
faulk would probably be a major focus
for you because you need to process all

824
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:05,559
that they dined and figure out

825
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:10,079
what to do with that am

826
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,390
your tools like you go

827
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:17,200
that you can use in terms of mental
gathering this this is also if you

828
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,180
again don't use this if all your
infrastructure is Microsoft because the

829
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:24,329
look weird when you have Windows like
Linux servers and chills

830
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:28,220
right but if you have some some Unix
machines

831
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:33,400
try to put honey pots to relevant and
have people logging into them

832
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,979
in telling you basically all their
secrets cars

833
00:50:36,979 --> 00:50:40,670
what do you do when you get shall
automatically start back during it

834
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:43,819
right where do you get back doors you
download them

835
00:50:43,819 --> 00:50:49,299
for your stash air to get all did you

836
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:54,509
leading call like back doors and Linux
stuff for free

837
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:57,160
right any get the fuck with people if
you watch this video for like a work

838
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,109
that was like

839
00:50:58,109 --> 00:51:01,430
this this is a honey but there's nothing
behind it and

840
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:05,799
and would you start like to add users it
asked questions and more questions like

841
00:51:05,799 --> 00:51:07,089
are you sure you wanna

842
00:51:07,089 --> 00:51:13,019
do this yes what is the name of the is
like I told you I was like

843
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:16,029
bennies you see people just going R A
minus RF enter

844
00:51:16,029 --> 00:51:21,039
minor flick deletes raise nothing works
it's just the toll both

845
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:26,119
im other tools like artillery again you
place them in strategic places you get

846
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:29,519
information about people trying to fuck
with your infrastructure

847
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:34,430
its easy and since they're doing it to
you could do things back to them

848
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:38,729
to either shut them down or just fought
with them for for fun and get more

849
00:51:38,729 --> 00:51:42,200
more information or intelligence

850
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,369
gonna skip through this because we're
really running

851
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:49,249
late I i no I don't care about time but
it's like keep you forever we gonna

852
00:51:49,249 --> 00:51:49,970
party

853
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:54,809
im your is basically a and instanceof

854
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:58,930
an organization that work for we have
use of a national organization

855
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:02,529
a they suspected the the they're having
some bridges inside and someone sifting

856
00:52:02,529 --> 00:52:03,319
the it up

857
00:52:03,319 --> 00:52:07,200
so what we did is we created fake
information

858
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,039
and that was relevant to what we're
trying to investigate

859
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:14,549
put it in in several places and
basically track down

860
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:18,140
who is accessing it again it's my
information I can do whatever I want

861
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:18,900
with it

862
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:23,359
in if it's false and someone touches it
and tries to fuck with it

863
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,940
dude we gotta talk and

864
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:31,140
wear them to fight it and and accounting
is on touched it

865
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:35,450
so we look to the internal user we
talked to the user went back to the PC

866
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:38,839
user was kind of okay their accounts

867
00:52:38,839 --> 00:52:43,329
what you expect and and we found it rose
on PC that was not detected by any

868
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:44,170
antivirus

869
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:47,910
guess what big surprise a.m. it's a
forensics

870
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:52,390
into response tracked down to I mean
keep the communication going

871
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:55,420
never just own pros in the lead the

872
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:58,710
use use you gonna get owned again

873
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:02,729
a tractor the quick control server to
some were

874
00:53:02,729 --> 00:53:06,789
wrong here and actually track the bad
guys

875
00:53:06,789 --> 00:53:11,180
because again if you keep communication
open you keep feeding the information

876
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:15,819
you can actually get to you the point
where you get human interaction not just

877
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:20,890
technology but we quickly IP address
great some Russian boar proposing

878
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:24,309
good luck with that and getting
directions who can actually get to the

879
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:25,900
people running

880
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:29,200
the bad things few left notes

881
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,809
play nice with others you're not alone
out there look at you guys

882
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:36,249
we're all here all deal with the same
shit

883
00:53:36,249 --> 00:53:39,559
this is what we're here for to talk to
each other on the stand how do you solve

884
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:41,599
your shit ok this is how I sort my shit

885
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:46,609
like great idea a and their place is
Derek designed to do just that

886
00:53:46,609 --> 00:53:50,339
right certs governments will help you a
lot of times peers

887
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:55,970
okay and yes competitors we talked about
it

888
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:59,299
this is my sanity slide him is nope
again

889
00:53:59,299 --> 00:54:03,890
you cannot throw money at the problem
and expected to be sold

890
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:08,690
right money technology it doesn't work
you need to really figure out things

891
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:14,079
holistically from a business perspective
and then try to fix its

892
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:17,220
few to call for actions if you're a
vendor

893
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:21,819
get your shit done right stop pushing me
and the verses and patches and ideas

894
00:54:21,819 --> 00:54:24,869
that don't work well they work after a
play with them

895
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:29,150
for my purposes start building
technology that fits

896
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:34,130
what I need as a defender as a business
again I'm not protecting technology on

897
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:35,200
protecting

898
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,210
a business

899
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:42,130
deal with data right loosely typed I
just wanna throw all that I have

900
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:45,130
into one pocket right magic packet and
have

901
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:49,410
something come out of it but says here's
a map of everything that's going on I

902
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:50,479
can't drill their women

903
00:54:50,479 --> 00:54:53,940
at like fancy ship build it please

904
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,910
right all I have right now is like a
bunch of scripts that are like

905
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:57,739
processing

906
00:54:57,739 --> 00:55:01,109
statements broken if your defender

907
00:55:01,109 --> 00:55:05,009
all your data right this is your

908
00:55:05,009 --> 00:55:08,190
homie advantages like home field
advantage up

909
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:12,749
this is my turf I could do whatever
kinda funky I want this turf

910
00:55:12,749 --> 00:55:16,319
cause it's mine if you step into the
whole your problem should've stopped

911
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:16,599
there

912
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:20,049
says no trespassing on on the on the
sign up there

913
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:24,589
gather intelligence right it's not a bad
word it's not about again it's not

914
00:55:24,589 --> 00:55:26,579
playing against the rules

915
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:30,589
there are no rules it's not fair so get
intelligence on who's out there to get

916
00:55:30,589 --> 00:55:31,559
you

917
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:35,180
so you can know right we gotta get some
stuff together

918
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:40,410
