1
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,650
okay I

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,420
so we what we do is so

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,940
we work on the detection so that we
architect so

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,609
all this junk and protects other people
and we also

5
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:20,449
our research showed you analysis of some
other more interesting stuff

6
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:24,279
and whenever something a really
interesting comes up

7
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:27,680
every once in a while I presented at a
conference like this

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,719
also was so he probably

9
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,910
have guessed by now we'll be looking at
so the end of iris and whatever

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,960
are real virus so pops up it's always
always all quite interesting for us

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,809
are up that's a real file infecting

12
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:47,510
parasitic virus not not a Trojan it also
add so

13
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,010
more work offer us because we have to
clean it so we have to restore the

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,789
all the infected files to the original
stay we can just a bit like a Trojan

15
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,600
but so is always fun it's so it reminds
us of the old days so

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,749
the old filing factors and not only is

17
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:07,650
is this topic interesting because it's a
virus its another person virus but in

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,050
dark

19
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,170
itself is also a very interesting virus

20
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,210
it's not the traditional kind like a a
file appender or pretend they're

21
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,680
where we to in go search the hard drive

22
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,000
%uh looking for executables to infect of

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,110
but it's so I've heard called some

24
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,890
somewhere compile a virus so what it
would do is that it with

25
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,590
targets are dealt developers computers
people who are using

26
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,640
healthy and that would infect Saturday
of the library in though

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,300
a programming environment and as a
result

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,230
every every project ever executable
compelled by this environment would get

29
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:43,920
up infected

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,600
this has I'll lead or over the past
three years

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,710
in arctic white massive spreading cuz

32
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,650
also legitimate companies who got
infected by this and worshipping

33
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,360
all their programs their applications
infected so

34
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,550
are the widespread so this this this
thing was a a quite widespread

35
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,270
so will be or we'll be taking a look at
all

36
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,349
more morow all sort of our high-level
look

37
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,459
at the evolution are with the virus was
so

38
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:16,780
doing in the earliest or early variance
until the

39
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,290
from their legal variance up to the most
recent ones oh and also a little more

40
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,060
in-depth look

41
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,630
so at the code all so

42
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:32,150
for I love the reverse engineers or or
for all the people who aren't so

43
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,080
working with malware analysis don't
worry this is not going to be are any

44
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,310
a hardcore stuff we're not gonna be
looking at kernel-mode

45
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,710
rickets and stuff like that offer all
the rivers engineers here

46
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,030
I'm sorry but it's not going to be any
hardcore stuff so it's gonna be like

47
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,480
a little off and alice is so far

48
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,510
a lightweight analysis of an interesting
virus

49
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,850
okay so let's all take a look at the
first therein as I mentioned it's about

50
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,680
three years old

51
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,240
I'll at this stage it was more of a

52
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,580
more of a proof-of-concept code like an
alpha stage shows somebody was

53
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,790
apparently experimenting

54
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,319
all it is also not the first so

55
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:13,080
compile a virus like proof of concepts
I'll

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,740
of for love this song kind are they were
also introduced back in the eighties for

57
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,810
all the sea

58
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,920
of us plus compiler I think so %uh but
this is that this is this is the first

59
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,290
so I think massive

60
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,840
for a massively spreading or example
that we

61
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,200
at least we have seen also let's let's
take a look at how how it so

62
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,660
proceeded to with the infection so it
targeted a system library

63
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,080
I'll call sys-con start-up pass I'll

64
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,569
some are constants are used by Dell
feeling

65
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:48,709
so with every recompile project was
starting

66
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:52,200
talking healthy version so 427 and

67
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,780
that's all all I was doing so it was
spreading it was a infecting

68
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,349
all Delfi Delfi programming environments
but apart from that

69
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:04,410
a spring mechanism it had no real
malicious payload

70
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,510
so stick a look at the code

71
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,120
what it actually looks like hope the

72
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,120
phones are big enough for you to see

73
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:31,120
okay so there's that that's the compiled
one that's the source code

74
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,199
appear as though legit stuff

75
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,330
although although Constance

76
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,509
use by Delfi and down here the stuff
that's

77
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:45,610
not legit a by adding a few

78
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,419
few lines we could bring it to more
readable form

79
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:53,139
all all this code does as I said it's
infects

80
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:57,900
it infect so the environment so when
this was this was run all it was do is

81
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,349
it would look up all this file and

82
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:04,720
add this so this cold I'll

83
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,729
to where it's at right now and

84
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:12,400
this is where you can see where it's
doing so would look for the Delfi

85
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,630
are dealt the installation directory by
querying

86
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,810
the registry it was starting versus 427
are

87
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,180
it only looked into in this directory
then over here

88
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,620
all after having having effected a thats

89
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,930
procedure are the here

90
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,340
so it would it would add all of that
cold

91
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,849
in there in the and its Fordo

92
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:41,919
run that's preprocess

93
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,280
with these parameters so we would

94
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,190
it would compile all the pass file and
though the

95
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,470
the resulting DCU I would be links to
every

96
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,430
every a project coming out of this
infected like infected 0

97
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,330
ID okay

98
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:08,330
slides okay

99
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:16,300
of that about so two years later

100
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,750
of the second though variant popped up

101
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,650
other code has been completely rewritten
it featured

102
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,680
all some some improvements

103
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,840
but it still had no malicious payload so

104
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,110
some of those or improvements featured a
better better way OVA searching for the

105
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,779
Delfi

106
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:39,610
installation directory now rests are you
are probably aware of

107
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,340
are Delfi has undergone something
changes so

108
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,190
for from Borderlands 2 a coat year it
was borderline

109
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,479
development studio all I think it's
Embarcadero now

110
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:55,400
a so so this this so

111
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,070
targeted so these these name changes
that well it also made the code analysis

112
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,180
a little bits

113
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,180
are more difficult by adding something
Christian

114
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,159
using some really primitive anti
debugging tricks and though there are

115
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:10,210
also some functions which will show you

116
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,370
I'll just now but they're that are on
you so

117
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,180
obviously somebody was experimenting
with this stuff

118
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:24,389
okay so

119
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:28,050
here again sis cons of pass-through

120
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,510
the gym it starts at the bottom over
here some

121
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:35,099
thing that's not supposed to be there a
secret to this time

122
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,320
and if we the cryptid

123
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,729
sis

124
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:46,440
this is what we're ending up seeing so
from the strains you can see that its

125
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,159
saw

126
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:51,199
it's looking looking offer though
installation directory

127
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,240
at different places it's targeting

128
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,449
everything different versions as well or

129
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:02,710
the end result what it what it would do
is is the same as before

130
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,810
but we ought we also see some

131
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,080
some interesting strings like how the
oil your Oman deal

132
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,099
all stuff like that which is on used so
that anti detect

133
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:17,779
calm and

134
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:21,029
is the entity picking stuff

135
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:24,419
yeah

136
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:28,270
over here there are some really are
really trivial

137
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,419
or untidy big debugging tricks

138
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:37,029
it was using it's pretty much

139
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:41,329
pretty much it so

140
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:44,329
little more when we're talking
time-consuming to analyze

141
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:48,410
all still the same payload are I E no
payload

142
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,650
hollywood just effect spread

143
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:57,439
%uh this this version are wasn't as
successful in spreading as the first one

144
00:08:57,439 --> 00:09:00,500
all but that it didn't really matter cuz

145
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,980
so a new new version came

146
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,540
later

147
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,589
okay and that's so in Dixie so that

148
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:14,829
so first part of power in August 2000

149
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:18,589
11 again the code was so completely
written rewritten

150
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:22,199
this was a this was a more a major or

151
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:26,520
major release so they were much much
bigger difference is this I'm

152
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,140
are the the targets of a target library
that it was

153
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,810
infecting change so it was assists in
its head of past now and set up says

154
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,790
Const

155
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,540
I'll pass it also added a classic exist
a

156
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,120
file infection vector so it would all
the cool for executables

157
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,750
by traversing the raw files for all file
structure

158
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,880
of hard drive what's a regular guy was

159
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,680
wire so do you and now it all actually
also did or something

160
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,079
evil so let's take a look at this so

161
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:02,130
latest reincarnation of the virus all

162
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,770
that's the Senate so don't pass or with
just two lines

163
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:11,390
of cold or inserted into the file

164
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:16,079
all as you can guess the function create
my file

165
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,300
off from this array is defined in this
so

166
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,060
defines start Inc include so let's take
a look at its

167
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:32,060
over here

168
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:40,580
okay resolution change sorry for

169
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,920
good

170
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,870
okay so or the senate's

171
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,440
house file looks like this see

172
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,089
I can find go the militia stuff really
quickly

173
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:14,850
over here so there's though

174
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,920
this line of code was a inserted by the
virus and

175
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,750
this line of code was inserted by the
farce and

176
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,950
as you can probably guess from just
looking at that

177
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,410
here all this array

178
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,670
contains the body of the virus its 52

179
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,700
thousand seven hundred and thirty-six
bytes long

180
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,339
and down here

181
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:42,580
all we can see the part where

182
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:47,960
where so drops that onto the hard drive
and executed so now

183
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,360
now it's so now it's our regular regular
compiled though

184
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,370
PE executed also I'll

185
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:02,370
will be loading up holding that up to
idea

186
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,030
so there some there some insulation

187
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,620
Stoff 02 remain persist in on the end
infected so

188
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,840
machine that's not really important are

189
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,890
I mention that so it also has a

190
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,270
secondary infection vector so that it
looks so

191
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,650
for executable said he would I want to
infect

192
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:35,860
and thats carried out this function over
here

193
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,200
tries to insect and

194
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,290
this is the part where it

195
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,270
or ash actually in infect saw the
Delphine environment so what age

196
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,360
what I just showed you over there all

197
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,570
here good logical drive strings all

198
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:59,610
enumerates the drives all it filters for
some

199
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,070
some all drive types that it's not
interested in

200
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:08,180
for example CD-rom's and stuff like that
arm

201
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,040
okay the second part is used for the
Gulf infection

202
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,850
so it would also take so whether the
system volume information

203
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,400
or directory is present on the drive so
this is an interesting

204
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,270
method of though checking whether it's a
it's a hard right now to

205
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:29,980
removal removable media for example and

206
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:36,980
going here you can see the typical

207
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:42,240
typical stuff find first file fine X
File traverse long flaw

208
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,260
of the directory structure and over here

209
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,060
now the left or the left path is taken

210
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,900
for the Delfi infection the right path
is so taken for the executable

211
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,070
I'll infection so what it does is that

212
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,560
it first checks whether it's in the
correct directory it looks whether

213
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,550
this fall this is so present in the path
whether this

214
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,840
and also they said if it's matches all
these criteria

215
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:13,200
its decides that okay I found the
correct directory all that's right dose

216
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,150
or two lines of code into

217
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,270
all that library to senator pass

218
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,130
these two lines of code and

219
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:29,130
where is over here it would

220
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:34,920
arm it will compile that so it's really
pretty

221
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,270
pretty simple or

222
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:45,270
simple technique

223
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,820
okay so I mention the secondary all
infection vector

224
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,220
so basically a bite saw

225
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,410
it so pre pender type A virus or more

226
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,560
more specifically all it would do or
append

227
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,010
although for executable that is trying
to infect in the cryptid

228
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,180
former after after itself for it would
limit I with

229
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,610
so string supernatural oh there would
also be a marker that the file was

230
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,310
infected

231
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:33,660
and this is an example of one such

232
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,760
infected executable down here is so
being created original file

233
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,800
%uh encryption methods or something
Israel some

234
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,180
books or soren add nothing nothing too
fancy

235
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,459
all okay let's look at the code

236
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:56,459
one more time

237
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,670
okay

238
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,769
this that the checks whether

239
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:08,760
the supranational string is so president
the strings are in cryptid

240
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:15,760
and nothing too interesting

241
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,029
this parts of course so

242
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:27,050
over here at one point checks whether
all

243
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,360
whether it contains are

244
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,060
an infected or executable well after
that after that string and it would

245
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,529
though

246
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:38,940
execute a drop it on the hard drive
executives like a normal virus

247
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,480
there's no but there's no wall entry
points redirection and

248
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,390
and all this stuff going on so it's a
really simple technique all

249
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:53,070
so the this this parser shirts search
drives to infect

250
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,329
are that was so effective the Delfi

251
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:59,810
in this case and in this case it was a

252
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,930
in this thread it was sorry searching
for the executables

253
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:08,130
but one interesting thing to mention
here is

254
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:15,130
this time it doesn't want to all system
volume information to be present

255
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,319
so with the secondary or infection
victories use 2002

256
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,600
this late to facilitate it to spread
even better it's so use for spreading

257
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,510
via removal

258
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:32,550
media so it doesn't so insect all
executables on the heart rise but

259
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,300
USB sticks share chart network drives
and stuff like that

260
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,050
arm and

261
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:44,200
as I mentioned it also has moshe spelled
like

262
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,679
almost all like over ninety percent of
nowhere out there

263
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,050
how some about no capability the the
ability to download

264
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,440
other malicious so junk onto the
infected machine so once they have

265
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,169
accomplished

266
00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:00,620
all to infect the machine they want to
leverage and

267
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,030
I'll make most most out of that so of

268
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:08,270
providing this so this service and
basically downloading

269
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,740
other malware in doing other malicious
so

270
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,380
these over there and here's our really
treviño

271
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,590
to reveal yourself defense mechanism are

272
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,100
you'll see in in a in a later slide why

273
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,280
why I'm showing you this it's really
really sure what it does is that it

274
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,640
looks whether task manager

275
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,220
%uh is running oh and when it finds it

276
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:39,790
so regular regulate guys great to have
32 snapshot process 32 first

277
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,900
next et cetera et cetera good finds it
it simply

278
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,030
all exits so with the virus will
terminate

279
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,020
are but more on that later all and the

280
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,940
actual payload as I said it's a
downloader

281
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,410
that would okay contains or three URL's

282
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:06,270
that it's trying to download from arm we
won't be able to see them here because

283
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:12,260
no

284
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,919
your because again

285
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,500
other anchor tits using this socks or
and nada

286
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:28,030
as you can see it's and HTTP address all

287
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,080
but the first file that would download
is not

288
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,040
the file all that it would do also
executes

289
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,360
but it just does it in a index quite
interesting

290
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:46,360
interesting way home

291
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:10,539
okay and the way does it is though that
it downloads or user avatars from our

292
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:13,840
off from certain our discussion forums

293
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,940
and heights hysol more links

294
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,320
or in these so that'll a steganography

295
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,679
or use their again this is not this is
not the first all malware

296
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:29,909
to use this technique but its I think

297
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:33,799
interesting nonetheless so one example
of

298
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,880
such downloaded file these is this

299
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:44,880
unsupported video mode

300
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,100
wonderful so

301
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,340
this look at it like this so here in the
ex if

302
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,580
I'll exit information

303
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,649
this part over here is another

304
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:05,630
in cryptid URL and that's the one where
it will actually

305
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,470
downloaddil and execute a bill from

306
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,940
and execute it also this isn't
dissidents interesting technique to

307
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:20,279
ought to control are the individual
bought solve provides a mechanism to

308
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,380
update itself but just by our uploading
a different

309
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,260
avatar with a different link all the
virus would do or download something

310
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,889
different and

311
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,970
yeah

312
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:38,200
so it's an avatar looking like this
there's another one

313
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,309
the warmest 3 that those are the three
download links

314
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:46,639
phone over there arm yeah

315
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:51,200
there's there's another URL or

316
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,539
so what was it doing what was
downloading it was downloading

317
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:58,659
arm piece of malware that we detect as
as

318
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:01,960
that's because the blood elf doll thank
you as so

319
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,409
as the name suggests it's a password
stealer so loss probably some kind of

320
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:10,179
some kind of spying was going on some
kind of so

321
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:13,789
a data theft oh this this also

322
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:17,529
also was so harvesting no FTP passwords

323
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:22,950
and other interesting interesting stuff
and

324
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,860
so once once a week once we thought okay

325
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,450
this is this is an interesting piece of
malware are

326
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:34,220
actually has a malicious payload now all
that so

327
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,659
let's all take a look at how successful

328
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:41,769
are the authors of this malware where
what they were after with

329
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:45,929
what their potential targets could have
been and

330
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:48,970
I was was scale of these attacks so when
we looked at

331
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,470
are telemetry off from the detection we
found

332
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,950
something really really interesting all
most targets

333
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,110
in Slovakia also for a lots of targets
in Russia

334
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,899
love these two together for like almost

335
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:08,279
eighty percent so for all that all the
worldwide detection

336
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:11,830
now this in Dixie very end it was a
spreading as massively

337
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,120
as though in the a so while

338
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,190
well indicate we we're detecting over
the time

339
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:24,440
all like tens thousands to tens of
thousands of

340
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,760
detections of per day when it was almost

341
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,779
active all this in Dixie very and it
only affected

342
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:35,080
a couple hundred till computers

343
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,460
all throughout its a lifetime altogether
and

344
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,519
when we look at one looks at

345
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:46,909
targets or it was no coincidence so

346
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:51,620
that so these countries were all were so
high in those statistics

347
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,919
all because i Slovakia one big girl

348
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:58,529
manufacturing company %uh was targeted
by this so

349
00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:01,549
I'll data stealing virus

350
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:05,919
ok which I won't name for obvious
reasons and in russia it was

351
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,120
saw to pick targets 0 lots of lots of
other smaller ones but to

352
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,230
or to big and really effective ones

353
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,730
I was one are one really big Russian
bank

354
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:21,049
and it was also are

355
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:25,179
I'll an office of our Russian state
institutions somewhere in your cutting

356
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:26,129
work

357
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:29,340
so quite interesting

358
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,840
so we have this we have this curious
curious virus

359
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,480
are which has an unconventional nor
spreading mechanism

360
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,980
are used for data theft so

361
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,000
that's pretty much its up for the virus
family

362
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,320
are so far up to date we have not seen

363
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,669
a virus %uh indocin the but it's not

364
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:54,159
it's not the end of the story quite yet
all

365
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,710
so who has heard of auto refill or where
var

366
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:02,020
here in the audience one so you might
have foreseen

367
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:09,020
reports like this in the news

368
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:14,970
so this was this was quite big in in the
Netherlands

369
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:18,360
and a lot of this also this so

370
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,549
0 also lots of information has been

371
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:24,570
are released on this so publicized

372
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:28,460
arm it was also also now where are you

373
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,549
use for data theft it had all different
so

374
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:36,360
different payloads it's quite
interesting but what struck

375
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,419
me as I as I a analyzed so

376
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:43,480
in Dixie all last year so when this came
to light

377
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,350
is the hook amount of similarities to
the to the

378
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,740
code of in doxie so this store fell

379
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,010
are it was almost that most active in

380
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,169
or I saw the light of day sometime in
May

381
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:02,220
this year it was most prevalent in the
Netherlands are it's not another

382
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,629
another incarnation of saw Delphia
doesn't

383
00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:09,379
have that unique mechanism of law

384
00:26:09,379 --> 00:26:13,539
it's a it's not and ok it so it doesn't
affect healthy alike and it does

385
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:16,850
are instead it infects so execute a boss

386
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:20,419
like in Dixie its it actually in the
very same

387
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:23,899
are very same way and it also infect saw

388
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:27,210
documents Word documents Excel documents

389
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:31,980
it turns those into are into executable
side

390
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,649
uses so really interesting interesting

391
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:40,169
our technique for are masquerading these
infected files

392
00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:44,340
up by using his sore right to left
override trick so

393
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,330
when the file name of the infected file

394
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,570
would be for example infected though SLX

395
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:56,110
oser so will be an executable I'll
screensaver

396
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,860
but saw this unico character over there
is the right to left over right which

397
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,559
would

398
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,610
all all have fall

399
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,200
have the effect of flipping that's right
to left so

400
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,330
on a default saw Windows seven set up
for this is

401
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,480
what so the victim with C are now this
doesn't

402
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,610
so worker all by default on on Windows

403
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:22,369
so XP because saw this so these right to
left

404
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:27,059
all right to left so care phone so
characters whatever

405
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:30,149
all their notes installed by default but

406
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,369
if they were it would it would work as
well it's not

407
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:36,769
no it's not the first time our to use
this trick but its it's an interesting

408
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:39,399
technique

409
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:43,450
and let's take a look at

410
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,840
the similarities between in the can
where r that I was mentioning sawdust

411
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,970
this look familiar at all a

412
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,519
delimiter string a different this time
but so

413
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,360
same same way %uh vo effecting
executables

414
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,970
Lightwood at the %uh the encrypt it
executable

415
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,149
after though a body of for the virus

416
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:07,519
all the virus is written Delfi again

417
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,539
like in Dixie are the crips and this
time is different

418
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:14,950
I have a have a table later on showing
though the comparison it's not just so

419
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:19,519
X or and ad but this is I think he's rc4

420
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:22,830
are does this ring a bell

421
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:27,659
just like in Dhaka on see was using the
avatars on the forums

422
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:31,369
are exactly the same way arc where far

423
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:35,690
all was doing that so hiding

424
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,250
hiding all other stuff other

425
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:45,530
law stuff to download the links for them
or inside these avatars

426
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:50,399
and thats seemingly meaningless saw in
trivial self defense mechanism

427
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,659
is again you East in square bar

428
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:58,599
all I don't know if you can see it's
from over there cuz the

429
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:02,789
phones are quite small but its apart
from though

430
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:07,950
sleep all value it's exactly the same
called

431
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:12,909
so here hear his a brief comparison of
the stuff as I said

432
00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:17,250
%uh both written Delfi are they are both
of virus so they're not

433
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,440
Trojans of the effects of

434
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,159
stuff little bit differently all
wherever also has so document infection

435
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:32,270
%uh in gook on the other hand how's the
infection of the Delta environment

436
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,450
are but then we see a lot of the cold is

437
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:39,629
or shared and it's so very very similar
also though

438
00:29:39,629 --> 00:29:44,260
traversal love although of the whole
file structure

439
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,440
other workers recursive immersion
enumeration of the disks

440
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:55,159
about the code over there is exactly the
same

441
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:58,580
so yeah or thats saw that's basically
it's

442
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,950
we have seen are very on

443
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,409
typical or Type A virus which so

444
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:09,679
through outsourcing its evolution was
first so

445
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,869
just sort of an experiment or didn't do
didn't do anything much

446
00:30:13,869 --> 00:30:18,389
are in the latest version it was or
possibly Houston no

447
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:21,809
in targeted attacks and then another

448
00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:25,480
on other malware family which shares a
lot of call lot of cold

449
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,399
or with in Duke all

450
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:33,409
probably as I said probably not so the
same goes behind it but so definitely

451
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:34,200
lots of

452
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,419
inspiration up from this family

453
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:44,419
so if there is any questions fire away

454
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:49,460
okay thank you
