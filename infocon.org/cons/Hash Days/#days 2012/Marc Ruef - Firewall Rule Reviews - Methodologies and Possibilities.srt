1
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,020
so

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,450
I like to welcome you to

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,260
to los toques of the first day of

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,450
hey Stace am I'm going to talk about 50
who reviews

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,890
and yesterday when we were and that the
speaker stand her

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,430
long-term Khaliq mine told me well your
topic is very

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,480
alt very dusty and I want com

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,890
to this talk because it might be very
boring and

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,340
so I'm very glad that so many people are
using at full

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,579
maps and or lost in this room instead of
the other one

11
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:45,970
am hmm well of course final review sees

12
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,120
is a very traditional topics in in my
opinion am

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,130
what I think we have a lot of experience
collected in the last

14
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,890
two decades and I'd like to present you
some of our experience

15
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,489
in this field am after

16
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:04,869
a quick introduction I'm going to
explained

17
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:09,759
our approach to do the modeling of I
will rule cents to do the reviews

18
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:13,100
and then we have fan of time indents we

19
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,609
me ask some questions hmm

20
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:20,819
the first of all where my my name is
Mark Reuss I'm here from Switzerland

21
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:24,639
am I'm for the third time

22
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:28,159
presenting text ace am I E

23
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,240
them and co owner of a

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,709
company colts keep in Zurich your
provide consulting services and

25
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:40,310
you're doing some auditing in forensics
and i have a web sites and

26
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:47,310
I wrote some books about the topic well
the goal of a final rule review is

27
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,149
you you want to determine in secure
roofs to increase security you want

28
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:58,729
it to determine the fish into strong
rules and obsolete rules

29
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:02,659
and if you are able to to identify those
rules

30
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:07,609
you are going or you will be able to
improve the quality of you finally

31
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:10,920
so I will show you different approaches
and

32
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,010
our missile vote see how we approach
final reviews

33
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,620
and it's the time allows it I'm going to

34
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:24,620
present you some thirty possibilities
basic question is so five rules rules

35
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,680
obsolete or or or firewalls elites you
dismay will saw

36
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,599
a quick shorts shitstorm in the
blogosphere and on Twitter

37
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:37,700
and many people think that fireballs are
obsolete and

38
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,260
and it doesn't make sense to use finals
at all I don't really share this opinion

39
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,209
I think

40
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:46,790
flywheel this is a good good way to
improve

41
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,420
network security and but of course you
shouldn't

42
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,670
rely on on firewalls only or or
anti-virus encryption whatever

43
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,959
it sits in should be in holistic
approach which

44
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,040
yeah respects all different kinds of

45
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,159
of threats and and possibilities am of
course if you're

46
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,489
the core of your network and Europe
occasions the secure

47
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,620
you wouldn't have to use firewalls
because everything would be perfect but

48
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,840
we don't live in a perfect world so I
will smite

49
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,269
help do to improve security of your
environment the so the steps

50
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:27,569
that all required it's to do if I will
do so a rule analysis

51
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:31,790
and weak will go through them first of
all you have to extract

52
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,140
am or to I'm

53
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,730
sorry first full you have to extract if
I will roots

54
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,890
and then you can work but if I wouldn't
suit you can

55
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,379
may be able to parse the 50 who sets by
six different objects and services and

56
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:47,060
stuff like that

57
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,299
and then you might be able to determine
global settings

58
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:54,120
which leads to the possibility to
identify weaknesses and to eliminate

59
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,829
them

60
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:58,079
hmm and they are

61
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,989
different approaches how to to work if I
will sometime

62
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:05,930
sets we prefer exported files that means

63
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,150
we go we say a customer's TV

64
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,150
has to send us that the configuration
setting rules at the office final

65
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,049
because it's much faster its more
reliable and to you don't have to I'm

66
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,459
use a face abstraction layer from

67
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:26,060
and I will come to that later but still
screenshots might be a good idea on

68
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,170
on-site analysis where you sit in front
of the

69
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:34,500
the front end of the 500 you got me said
walk through it

70
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,840
you might be able to enhance your report
this ritual

71
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,420
suspects and it's usually much easier to
do some cross checks

72
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,510
if you want to our stuff I will sex and
you have some implications

73
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,240
it's usually goods to see yes %um flick
simply

74
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,460
cation correct also on the using to fix

75
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,770
and sometimes to lost ok because term

76
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,980
you only can work with the using to face
because

77
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,730
the some firewalls don't allow you to
exports the rule sets properly

78
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,830
or you will get the cookie file formats
which

79
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,300
you you notes able to parse and so it's

80
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,370
to lost hope 22 approached her the sixth

81
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,060
getting the final rule sets is not easy
and it's different

82
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,330
on every different product as you can
see a star has

83
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,960
for example three different ways to
export the file room sets

84
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,240
and the funny thing is a.m. DC three
different race won't

85
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,640
and collects the exact same rule sets

86
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,780
you will get lots of the data will be
the same

87
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,840
but there are some differences since
defense

88
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,930
how to customer was able to export to
sets

89
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,950
what you can do visit and that there are
different formats

90
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,860
whether you to an export this to a
script which use

91
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,260
pretty much on document 232 the the
backup and restore on the

92
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,990
reporting interface am

93
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,980
yeah it's it's a I'm usually to
customers responsible to bring us the

94
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,020
bring us to if I will set and we have to
give him a step-by-step

95
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,430
how to an aunt's sometimes it's not that
easy because

96
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,920
for different reasons he complex s
different services or TCS disabled

97
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,490
services are you hassen

98
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,060
very old product that doesn't support
for example SSH or

99
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,650
or whatever so sometimes it's it's a
pizza hearts to

100
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,790
communicate if the customer to gets the
data that this

101
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:39,350
important for you written

102
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:44,910
if you get the final rule set to export
its there's two next

103
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:48,540
problem approaching it's that the
different

104
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,650
products use different formats for the
final 16

105
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,870
so for example Astaro checkpoint to 40k
test array-based

106
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,410
I'm rule sets which is primarily cool
what's

107
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,890
sometimes hard to read if you don't
parse it

108
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,100
am I personally prefer

109
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,690
command line based who sets because they
are very simple one-line one group

110
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,920
as he's cool into tech sexy the
NetScaler or

111
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,690
very popular and some products you see
any files

112
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,740
a most popular examples or McAfee

113
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,130
and SonicWALL and you know it's very
traditional but

114
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,310
it works am what's very different

115
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,520
or a very exciting kiss that McAfee Web
Gateway

116
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,020
provides a.m. the file in the XML file

117
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,140
as an export what inside XML file

118
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,320
is is in bed with oren encapsulated in
any fine

119
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,860
so we're they say are able to export XML
file spot

120
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,010
basically it's just a container for any
files

121
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,590
and and you have very different a.m.

122
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,530
on the standings for XML files ever look
less excuse the stand total trust my

123
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:04,350
a.m. all use XML file spot that the
config format this is very different and

124
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,050
to have a very different approach out to

125
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,480
creates the whole whole construct so am

126
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,860
if you are able to put to write the
parser for final rule sets you

127
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:20,550
usually or you never are able to use the
same person for the from product

128
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:26,580
so this is an example of this call Sam
as you can see 191 room basically

129
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,240
I like that because it's very simple and
simple this sole risk with

130
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,950
missus a.m. part of an offer to take
foreign cool sets

131
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:41,089
as you can see it's more like a tree
it's it's I'm

132
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:45,750
you are able to to to do connections and
to do more complex toughened and it

133
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,750
makes it much harder to understand the
final rule set mint workers

134
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,560
especially if you if you have posted

135
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,050
so the basic attributes of a final rule

136
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,310
for me is is you have to source host
cornett

137
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,770
if the source port destination host
taste nation port

138
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:10,180
a protocol on the nixon it's a conceit
your

139
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,640
some firewall allow additional a.m.

140
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,710
attributes for rules for example you can

141
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:21,410
defined time frames are you can define
priorities quality of service

142
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,310
whatever and and that's very very nice
to have a specially if you if you want

143
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,230
to improve the security of your
environment

144
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,280
what if I will rule analysis becomes
much much more complex if you have

145
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,080
attributes which are kind of exotic if
we do a very simplified 50 who

146
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,690
analysis re focus on the the six

147
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,050
basic attributes water if there is a
product which

148
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,210
introduce a certain and additional
functionality

149
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,240
we try to to respect that to rent
sometimes it's not easy because you

150
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,640
don't really understand what

151
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,250
what is important and how the difference

152
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,150
features work so then we try

153
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:03,070
to to create table based for most of the
final

154
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,320
rule set this a very simplified form as
you can see two

155
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,270
26 basic attributes if I will rue

156
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,420
again we try to find weaknesses in these
rules

157
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,970
cents this or few of the things

158
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,560
on our checklist we are trying to
identify a

159
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,410
the worst thing basically or any rules
which allow any traffic

160
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,760
and there are I'm more complex
weaknesses like him

161
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,290
mashup of of objects for example if you
have for

162
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:38,100
in one room a high security system

163
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,340
and also some some kind of public
service is defined in one group went and

164
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,670
the same rule is a fight for both
objects

165
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,950
what they aren't very at the same level
of security it's it's it's very

166
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,670
problematic

167
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,570
am and of course we try to identify and
secure rules

168
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,340
if you use burials COO protocols

169
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,370
something Christian or overlapping
objects and

170
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,210
and stuff like that

171
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,610
I'm am

172
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:14,279
usually do you have to half a lot of
experience in the network for youth and

173
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,490
application security field from the
stands how

174
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,330
a.m. the sweetness this really affect
the final rule set that means

175
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:25,110
and most of that the the keister do 250

176
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,529
rule analysis at our company our coming
from from the network

177
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:33,770
and day on the stand the problem staff
integrate its file system so they have

178
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,290
maintain maintain stem so it's its

179
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,420
makes them lot of a better for hats

180
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,790
to understand what the problems might be

181
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,910
then we try to identify beastie said her
insecurities

182
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,130
for example then you are some

183
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:57,520
here and we try to identify the risk for
the different groups

184
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,300
and then we suggest counties risks might
be mitigated

185
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,010
am of course from the stands that the
talking that work for customer you have

186
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,540
to understand the processes you have to
understand

187
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,630
lay out the quality of the network so
sometimes are subsistence

188
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,270
are a not respecting these details

189
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,150
so it's it's often so that the custom
assessor no we can't implement this

190
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,450
because this product's

191
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,810
has to use telnet because it doesn't
support SSH

192
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:29,540
and stuff like that but usually that the
primary goal is to

193
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,540
to tighten the the the rule sets as far
as possible

194
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,230
without destructing the the daily Daily
Worker

195
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:44,230
daily traffic on the network

196
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:49,670
a simple final rule analysis of an
inline element this is very simple

197
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:55,060
a.m. what most customers try to remove
redundant 50 environments

198
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,029
and then if you have to do if I will
room analysis you have to respect that

199
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:02,060
go there are two different file false
and

200
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,870
basically they have to have to the same
rule set

201
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,390
what it's not easy if you have hi writ
redundancy and you have to very fine

202
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,620
cross check if the rules are exactly the
same

203
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,240
it takes quite a lot of work or you have
to do a lot of parsing

204
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,470
am and in most cases when a customer
sese

205
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,170
there for redundant system and 05 also
reinstalled

206
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,370
exactly the same that's that's never
true it's only true if they do it's

207
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,339
automatically if they have scripts which

208
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:35,640
are murdering that the system and the
rules

209
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,830
but if they try to do it manually it
always face

210
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,560
that's always differences home from an
attacker point through

211
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,600
of you it's usually interesting because

212
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,410
if you have if I will whose established
and 50 a

213
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,460
and notices established in FY will be
New Hope to

214
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,460
gets the traffic to I will be because
there are

215
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:02,089
you aren't limited just this post

216
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:06,190
another level of complexity comes this
morty to file a false

217
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,930
no final allows a direct connection
between two points

218
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,010
if you have a single tear 50 its or an
inline element

219
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:19,060
you have for on a which communicates
through final to point B

220
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,920
and if you have a mole move to TX am
environment yes

221
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,980
multiple firewalls change together and
dis

222
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,600
introduces additional complexity

223
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,890
because you have to consider every tear

224
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,490
and effort grows exponentially Coast you
have to

225
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,930
I'm if you if you put different finals
in line

226
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,330
printing them you have some kind of my
shop both routes

227
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:48,010
sometimes there is a rumor on the first
five won't it a sin to rule on the

228
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,190
second final

229
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,190
sometime it's what sometimes their room
on the

230
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,600
on both fireballs do have to find out
what what kind of traffic really goes

231
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,680
through all these elements are all the
same

232
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,170
don't this difference i wills
furthermore

233
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:09,050
the you have to to find out what the
priorities of the final rule set

234
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,360
sometimes

235
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,510
the for example if you have to file who
which

236
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,930
from is combined this intrusion
prevention system

237
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,279
and the next 50 isn't I'm

238
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:24,660
it sometime really hard to find out what
they're really that that the real world

239
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,170
work that that if I will rue said is
that this really established in the real

240
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:32,310
world

241
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,370
so because it's really hot from from
from

242
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:39,360
reviewer point if you to understand the
whole complexity of the system

243
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,680
we always suggest and sits citrus them

244
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,459
towards our customers to do a workshop
to discuss our findings

245
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:50,279
discuss our approach to discuss what
what ideas we have

246
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:54,140
and them sometimes the customer can def

247
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,560
very good feedback more information
about the network topology or routing

248
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,510
expects

249
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:03,570
and then you realize that some bility
sorry kisses

250
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:07,610
you over referring to aren't 3d

251
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:14,399
established in in the real world

252
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,410
a firewall aren't that simple anymore
like

253
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,640
let's say 15 twenty years ago

254
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,980
you have a lot of of additional features

255
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,010
I'm antivirus or a graph cashing

256
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,170
HTTP proxy capabilities and

257
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:37,180
mmm many finals allow global settings
for example you can define okay I wanna

258
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,510
enable anti-virus for all communications
or

259
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:44,170
I wanna enable out of date for this
antivirus

260
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,230
so 50 through an analysis

261
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:50,820
also have to to respect these global
settings and

262
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,110
am sometimes they're not part Ulster the
basics I will who

263
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,290
sometimes there are part of an
additional config file and you have to

264
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,860
find out the K

265
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,709
SonicWALL this is them storing the
starter there and if you have

266
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:07,970
to collect all the data and sometimes
it's really not easy especially

267
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,390
if customer comes to Aus we a product
that the

268
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:16,019
never have to test it before we usually
have a few days to find out how this

269
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:22,589
product really works and and how we get
to to date it is important for us

270
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:25,929
for the global settings we a.m. after
same approach

271
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:29,330
like for for consideration re reviews

272
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,879
BR identifying all different setting
state or

273
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:37,619
a provide its then we identified the
current value

274
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:41,639
the determined the recommended value the
value that the

275
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:45,850
recommends to increase the level
security and if there's a difference

276
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,669
3 am provides

277
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:56,669
a risk rating for this potential
weakness

278
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:02,419
so if you have gone the 50 who'll
analysis

279
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:05,789
of the of the traditional roots and you
if you have for

280
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:08,919
done the context review of the global
settings

281
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:13,600
a.m. gift the recommendations to the
customer

282
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,350
and he's going to implement most of them
hopefully or all

283
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,730
am but there are rules remaining some
rules

284
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,889
can't be talks because they must be like
they are or

285
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:27,369
or at the new rules to improve truce or

286
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:32,119
has the best level of security but they
have to be like they are because you're

287
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:36,360
he wants to provide the service so a.m.

288
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,480
our idea is to two were to

289
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,929
rates the remaining rules or or to rate

290
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:46,499
the established rules and we have
different approaches in

291
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:49,820
re aren't really some

292
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,179
didn't really came to a conclusion we
are still experimenting a bit

293
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:58,090
in this field so a one of the approaches
is to use a CVSS

294
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,570
to rates the difference rules and here
is a

295
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,019
very simple example 4 a.m.

296
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:10,610
typical connect are typical connections
over 50

297
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,299
a.m. and the scoring should help you

298
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:18,940
to see okay this kind of communication
is the most severe arista most risky

299
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,639
because

300
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:22,769
there are very that the system so very
important

301
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:26,659
or or very insecure services or provided
or

302
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:29,869
I'm you have to a very whites

303
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,869
attackers attack surface so this live

304
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:36,379
least would help you to identify rules

305
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:39,379
reach if you can cooks

different approach to provide dating you
network

308
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:52,149
so with its a lot of I will reviews and

309
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:56,669
Trites to arm collect some statistical
data on

310
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:00,840
here concede findings the different
thanks you're

311
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,679
looking for this article est am

312
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,889
and disc graphic illustrates that

313
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:11,989
the two different thinks and there are
problems

314
00:20:11,989 --> 00:20:15,690
reach usually effects most customers I'm

315
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,889
typical pro problems or protector
logging off rule seasoned relating able

316
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:21,700
to

317
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,549
and any rules is something that you find
everywhere

318
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:31,159
sometimes sooner or later

319
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:34,879
and this graphic shows the

320
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:40,279
most order to the findings that we see
the most

321
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:44,029
any rules by the exxon Paris again

322
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:47,889
any rules with the destination
complaints and

323
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:51,950
am so relieved that than any finding is
always a high signing in

324
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,299
be always report it and think that that
that that's not correct because

325
00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:00,499
that's not the type 50 who set to if you
want to use any real secret to her

326
00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:07,499
go to a simple Lutheran it and this
basically same

327
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,499
when we do if I will analysis for the
first time

328
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:19,149
a.m. we see or we have

329
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:23,470
if you stand to pick up a pro Texas at
least see on the truth

330
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:28,129
we see for the first time analysis
between 20 and 30 percent of the rules

331
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:32,999
that contain we can assess can be such a
store customers through and anally

332
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:37,460
analysis and really

333
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,809
especially stiff tool set too so waz
them changed and there are improvements

334
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:44,989
we cease we still see between seven and
10 percent

335
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:48,320
weakness a single-sex am

336
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,909
is a test to do a.m. and analysis once a
year

337
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:56,210
am a full analysis and

338
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,639
a.m. it make sense if you have thirty
changes or

339
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:06,639
large changes to do in an incremental
analysis of the changes

340
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,419
so why are there so many problems in
finals I mean

341
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:15,070
the top because old and dusty ascites in
the beginning

342
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,629
am but still we are failing is the same
problems that the

343
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:23,559
10 twenty years ago there are many
mistakes

344
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:26,570
a lot of laziness am

345
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:30,179
and a lot of misinformation and
misunderstanding

346
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:34,239
especially if you loss environments
corporate environments it's not

347
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:37,980
on usual that that that the person that
implements a product

348
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,739
doesn't really know which kind of ports
that are required and defender

349
00:22:41,739 --> 00:22:45,119
States okay we Nizza 30,000 ports

350
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,379
to communicate this to different host
its not

351
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:53,830
unusual and because time missus precious
stay put in any rule or a very vice

352
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,830
definition of ports and

353
00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:02,830
yeah that makes rules much insecure

354
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:08,190
so that what's my presentation I

355
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:12,119
like to summary if I will also be
important extraction parsing at the

356
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:14,080
sectional final who set this is

357
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,700
very interesting thing and that I think
it makes sense

358
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,649
to to work if I wasn't try to improve
them because they are still an important

359
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:23,259
part in at work

360
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:27,100
and we always see the same week missus
over and over again

361
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,169
that's not a problem for for us because
it makes

362
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:33,679
are drop a bit easier but that's a
problem for the customers

363
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,480
term your because it's its seems that's
very hard to

364
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,580
to improve for them a.m.

365
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,519
yeah and and a good firewall rule
analysis respects the ferry for less

366
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:45,299
pacts

367
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:49,369
term offer 50 who like room common sense
looking

368
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:53,440
or any less important assess if you have
for wrote definition of ports or if

369
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:53,769
you're

370
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:57,049
use you

371
00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:00,299
there is some documentation how we do
that its

372
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,629
everything is on German sorry for that
and

373
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:04,419
and I State Park
