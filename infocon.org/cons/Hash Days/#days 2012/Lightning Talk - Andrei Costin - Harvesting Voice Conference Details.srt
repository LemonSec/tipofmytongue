1
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,940
he spoke out on a talker

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,930
just so briefly and quickly goal for
some of my research which is

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,280
for talk about their housing voice
conference bridges

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,080
I you might ask a all it's all about

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,890
so base km you you might have used

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,190
it at least once way you dial into a
bridge on you have like a bee conference

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,200
call with the lopers

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,860
product management so on and so on
issues and on a daily basis from

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,489
university to enter price on

10
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:38,329
accompanies only you specialize the
service providers basically for they

11
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:39,020
have like

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,050
his single source where they buy
basically by the numbers and I'll

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,850
replied you pass for them basically if
the company

14
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,960
employees can use this for like

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,129
streamlining their operations or
sometimes they just deploy a smaller one

16
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:59,059
if %uh streaks VoIP IP based PBX inside
the company and the management's else

17
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,920
like open source or not open source but
manage the house

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,930
anyway both for these have like both
internal and external access number so

19
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,729
basically

20
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,650
employs on the rolls can dialing from
anyway in gold to have a conference call

21
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,980
to make the business running

22
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,830
so officers are starters he basically I

23
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,560
I usually like massive a large-scale
data collection I was working the

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,280
company with 20,000 employees

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,940
and their you know there's like a lot of
the Titans bearer

26
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,900
alt Luca and the Exchange servers you
know how it goes

27
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,840
I am now well why year

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,770
V's phone numbers I mean a lot of
assorted on on the collecting

29
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,490
your private information or they like
email addresses but missus

30
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,420
one think well bare feet with a voice

31
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,550
the some conference calls is but they
are not perceived as there is

32
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:56,230
well you know what does it mean it means
vet well the companies and the people do

33
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,420
not perceive it as a risk

34
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,530
when a person at taps into a call and
basically records intelligence all told

35
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,050
the call

36
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,270
if you remember the case it. circles
against FBI

37
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,979
mislead cause exactly this case even the
guys in

38
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,330
have guy or not aware that somebody
stepping better so basically

39
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,040
the King intelligence without even
knowing and the worst thing is like no

40
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,460
it's a

41
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,680
telephone a system it's a been based

42
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,460
and you least like four digits okay now
they have

43
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:30,250
eight or so on but anyway so it's a very
think the security features

44
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,030
and vase not so common to have a

45
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,270
local because users well for their pins
in the car is sometimes they just

46
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,380
mistaken

47
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,370
it's a trouble you have a their account
or conference call gets blocked so you

48
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,500
live there are not looking

49
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,959
altaïr incorrect been sold both for for
forcing his

50
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,410
a a very viable options okay so

51
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,300
I'll cover thing is that it's a it's a
hard task to do and

52
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,340
usually you need the from mesquite

53
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,500
voices one thing but to will toward
automate everything you need them

54
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,090
reliable an transcript from voice to
text and then

55
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,060
have some actionable intelligence on
this text there

56
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,250
which you can go home if by %um

57
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,040
having a prize like okay maybe I open
till there's a month ago bill

58
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,190
I i'm sure guys you use some movies or
you can

59
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,270
use Google Mail or some open API's which
is more or less free

60
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,599
also need reliable voice us keep this
suction

61
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,459
which you can do we've Google Voice or
Asiri kind of stuff or you can use

62
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:38,630
more professional ones okay

63
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,310
sorry so

64
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,220
conference rooms irri very tightly links
to this topic

65
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,730
because usually you have have always
conference rooms in their

66
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,580
outlook & Exchange which she has a lot
of information and usually

67
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,200
people share documents which are to be
discussed in

68
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,690
in the conference call and usually they
put their passwords and the

69
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,540
phone numbers involved details and guess
what because conference rooms

70
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,300
usually it's a shared resource is not
possible to resolve it

71
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,080
any budding the company conjoined the
conference I am well

72
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,090
if you have like a company worldwide
we've 500 conference from salt white

73
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,810
just ultimate although this for example

74
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,139
this is the interface usually for
example you have like

75
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:28,400
liberi you have very well structure that
the more or less and you have all the

76
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,190
details like

77
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,230
if you click when one of his you have
details with breach

78
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:37,360
and been calls and so on so month ago we
mentally scarred

79
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,330
just a call to PBL Commission

80
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,760
just go for all their exchange you get
like

81
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,020
free 100 megabytes of file we've all
their

82
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,500
historical records of all the rooms and
basically you see also the hell they

83
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,630
p.m. numbers even looted from love his
voice conference and so on

84
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,490
so this is internal part basically from
enterprise-level weighing

85
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,680
you you have to be a bit like an insider
okay you can

86
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,720
goal through various faiths into the
company but sometimes V's details just

87
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,320
click on the internet because people are
not aware of his

88
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,410
is this occurs concern so

89
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,949
just what you have Google dorks fan is a
small these both

90
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:22,479
releases I bigger in the developing

91
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,760
so this is just an example

92
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,199
so should I V is kinda thinkin will you
see like

93
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,750
passcodes you attend excess cord you
don't like

94
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,930
at their daily numbers and so on so on

95
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,500
am give like millions of records

96
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,180
so one thing you can darn being policies

97
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,380
or bus or force is gone are the numbers
you can dial in and just wait on

98
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,880
they record their wave file and the also
you can

99
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,139
though some other intelligence covering

100
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:58,350
so Dustin I'm not show I'm not sure if
I'm going to

101
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,820
with them comments okay cool

102
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,820
so harvesting is like the first up is

103
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,150
fine confront that they'll ever explain
like have insider or

104
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,229
outlook gave have a big group kind of
things

105
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:15,780
Google dorks for just the have both
kinda leaked emails like FBI and the

106
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,340
I i'm too sick case then just

107
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,560
they call that big big data set just

108
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,710
run it for Gmail and then or

109
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,940
I mean if you're you're not able to to

110
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,430
a for the API or don't want to write the
script just

111
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,940
from within Gmail then you can ultimate
a call the non-call out in station

112
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,639
using Skype or and however white bass
client which is program will buy up by

113
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,100
10 or

114
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,389
or whatever your flavor is and then

115
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:49,639
the last episode because other it's like
more of artificial intelligence some

116
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,020
I mean ago these not yet to be here
about that leads to be here too

117
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,669
record everything and

118
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:01,160
you have some my arm tools and
frameworks

119
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,440
okay this is a real example let's
abilities all-male which

120
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,440
got leaked or got could somehow sniffed
the

121
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,080
if we're on it for Gmail you see fit
gmail actually

122
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,610
automatically detects a number way you
click it opens out there

123
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,270
just call it so they have this kind of
tools already built in

124
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,590
and they also the deck that they

125
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,680
they pop up to you at the calendar so
basically they have

126
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,280
of this kind of intelligence you can use
these but I mean this is

127
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,660
in Gmail you want them or a control so
basically use

128
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,550
white-only phone numbers and buy from
there to tell you integrative Skype VoIP

129
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,729
scripting so

130
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:42,120
you can see both from these text

131
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,020
basically week struck their for numbers
and

132
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,509
that they okay and the generous 17 so

133
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:54,110
we basically governor in a scripps
ultimate that men are all the

134
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,949
intelligence nope

135
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:58,479
went to connect to which number to
connect which been to the aisle

136
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,250
and the so on

137
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,919
so just periodically loaded them on a
date they have a shared calendars

138
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,300
well watch out there what they tell you
your employees published to the Internet

139
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,190
because

140
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,840
a was offering seeing is a

141
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,120
sensitive and thank you
