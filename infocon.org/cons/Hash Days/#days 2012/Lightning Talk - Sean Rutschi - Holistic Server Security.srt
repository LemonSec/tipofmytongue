1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,640
alright

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,769
my topic is a

3
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:13,840
holistic service security and

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,100
the reason

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,160
that's his fault he challenged me to do
it

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,990
so challenge accepted a quick overview
if

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,180
what I'm going to talk about a.m.
obviously

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,540
winding issue his fault again quickly
who I am

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,940
and I'm gonna talked about the topics
network heartening patch management lock

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,070
reviews back up man even if you last
thoughts

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,199
original this comes up with a plan for
15 minutes

12
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:41,930
a jump down to its old enough to really
hurry through it

13
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,000
bites are mining charter che

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,730
I'm security consultant at scape and

15
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,149
I he no with me information aka my own
website

16
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:56,530
WWE it up I V for and that's %eh and I
and the Twitter handle

17
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,090
my previous experience came from being
system engineer

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,080
I have no previous experience as a
speaker to come so these presentations

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,880
from to cover

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,369
really quickly so don't expect any
miracles from me bite so

21
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:13,560
first topic was network this is how

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:20,560
love the network track traffic usually
looks like so

23
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:24,280
first a my contacts will he be start
filtering at this point

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,920
anything that stops here doesn't bother
to servers and it's our job to make

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,570
service happy and we like having happy
servers at implement never segmentation

26
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,600
because anything that can be segmented
probably can help increase security

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,530
use firewalls according to concepts if
you have a concept

28
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,780
and you do have a concept everyone at
yes everyone is a concept perfect

29
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,210
if you have firewalls because you have
firewall rules

30
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:55,479
these rules 10+2 get forgotten from time
to time to remove a server but forget

31
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,090
file wheels for the server

32
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,740
so do for firewall rule reviews and

33
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,409
remember marks talk from yesterday we
could point start

34
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:08,920
and last but not least don't over
complicate things if you need one

35
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,579
firewall don't put in three

36
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:15,000
just keep it simple so next point with
the hardening

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,680
other surprises hiding out there are a
few

38
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,310
forget its this is what you end up with

39
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,989
first biased read the documentation

40
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:29,410
software using there a lotta

41
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:34,230
config options that are hidden any the
documentation that you only find

42
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,329
when you actually reading to talk you so
research if you don't understand those

43
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:38,910
options

44
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,950
find out what they do and see if they
knew if they can help you

45
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,239
use access control lists on multiple
levels

46
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,400
second and final level that can be on
the server software level that can be on

47
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,250
the UES level

48
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,699
reduce much as you can you don't need

49
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:57,750
and network share server

50
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,980
if all you have there is email its

51
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:06,519
unnecessary so drop it again do periodic
review see if what you have is up to

52
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,000
date

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,109
you can duties reviews on sperm on
phones PDA

54
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:13,449
important is that it fits to your
concept and that you doing it

55
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:16,930
I mentioned you should week
documentation

56
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,799
so patch management

57
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,049
you you you don't want to be fighting

58
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:28,359
a huge source a huge brought sort of a
small stick you

59
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:33,060
lives so let's not do that if the vendor
has a patch cycle

60
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,380
keep to it make sure that you were
getting information to get the

61
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,590
information that you need

62
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,620
if the vendor doesn't have a patch cycle
and pretty happy visor talk

63
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,600
it's your job to make sure that you
actually are up to date and keep up to

64
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,130
speed

65
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,519
patches can be categorized

66
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,889
is a patch important if it is critical
and

67
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:55,900
something you might remember the Apache
killer

68
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,650
the problem going around last year I'm

69
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,750
that one was highly important you don't
have time to test on those

70
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,160
you don't have time you have to
implement the patch as soon as possible

71
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,190
if you can't invent a patch of two
internet to work around

72
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,530
so if you have the time you can test
apaches

73
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,709
because there's nothing worse than
installing a security patch

74
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:18,690
and after that half your service don't
work a monster intended to

75
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,829
and we've all probably

76
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:26,010
van into that kind stuff I know I spent
an entire weekend

77
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,290
fixing those problems multiple times so

78
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,729
test patching is really recommended

79
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:37,720
began research the patch to see what it
does it is it out

80
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,169
does it remove does it change options in
the configuration

81
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:44,460
if it does we go back to heartening

82
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,449
you want to know what those options do
you want to know how it's changed you

83
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:50,349
want to know how you're affected by it

84
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:53,970
last but not least enforce the patching
on the kleins we know where the biggest

85
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,770
problems lie on client machines we've
got that

86
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,960
we've got adobe is a prime example with
said the flash problems

87
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,080
we've got that Adobe PDF Reader problems

88
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,150
if it is Nana good level love patching

89
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:15,349
problem since you so enforce it

90
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:21,569
reaction I see a lot for people who look
at their locks for the first time

91
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:27,550
and Alexander Congress to yesterday
myself defending databases talk

92
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,629
in all the time and other times you
don't have the time

93
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:34,129
to actually react to wear log entries

94
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:37,879
within a reasonable time so

95
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,020
take that a few hands automates the lock
a

96
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,199
review process and automate decoding
reactions

97
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,340
the come from its blocking an attacker
or

98
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,569
whatever you want to do consider
correlations

99
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:56,949
meaning consider what servers need to
talk with each other

100
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,150
consider what services need to talk with
each other and then

101
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,500
accordingly a make sure that you love
reviews

102
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,370
take that into consideration

103
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,749
the other hand there are some locks
entries that you need to react on

104
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:17,050
you need to get informed those so the
and escalations the process should be

105
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,330
established

106
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:23,699
again lot we use our automated
automation is great to a certain point

107
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,499
Anna certain point you have to go back
and you have to do it yourself

108
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:30,439
going to read through with the locks
going checked that the automation

109
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,939
process is still doing what it's
supposed to

110
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:36,189
and as its was intended to do

111
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:39,499
it seems many programs use different
look for months and some even changed a

112
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:42,509
lot for months after a version update

113
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:46,770
that'll probably be the bloody your time
on their

114
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,949
so backup management yep

115
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:55,659
backup management is part of it

116
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:59,340
use a dedicated machine automate your
backups again

117
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,330
if you do if you have to remember to do
it you forget it once and there's

118
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,319
nothing worse than

119
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,650
having a backup when you need it at most

120
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,830
rate is now back up restrict the backup
machine to only be able to run the

121
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,389
backup system backup machine itself does
not need to do anything else

122
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:17,800
if possible restrict remote access to
backup machines that only you can access

123
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,259
it

124
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,810
make sure to backup can be restored
great you've got daily backups and not a

125
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,349
single one has any use to you

126
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:30,069
time wasted also consider the comedians

127
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:33,960
you need your storage and you can eat
the

128
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,960
the encryption on it if you story about
site I mean

129
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,129
great you've got backups everything but
if you're building burns down

130
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:45,889
it's no use to you so last faults

131
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:49,650
I don't have a better picture sorry

132
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:53,300
got the these are just a few points i
wanna throw in and then that's it

133
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,770
you got to Mauer protection harder
disposal high availability redundancy

134
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,849
capacity planning use management
awareness training and knowing guide

135
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:02,699
showing the clock for 10 seconds left

136
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,789
so that means I've only got five now
which means

137
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:06,939
I've got no time for your questions
