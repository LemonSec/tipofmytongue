1
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,670
ok I

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,980
sought my name is a is a Robin and my
talk is a little bit off topic

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,270
was also been for 15 minutes but I guess
we're it

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,050
intersect with the Securities when it
comes to a disclosure and

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,660
transparency some what happened is a

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,380
I was in Japan last year during the
earthquake March 11

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,830
a.m. was I mean

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,070
users quake-tsunami you or heard about
it

9
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,530
problems

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,510
so obviously a pork and blew up that so
what's in the picture

11
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,469
a non situation and maybe this
traditional because not

12
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:49,280
is an outstanding thats lack of
transparency from the government there's

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,329
no information

14
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:53,500
nobody knows what's their situation on
the

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,559
field problem

16
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,609
no equipment so cue counters where a
sold-out

17
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:05,120
in I guess one week after the earthquake
not in Japan not in Switzerland not

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,640
anyway

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,460
what do you do so solution is them

20
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,920
get your soldering irons am make sensors

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,740
but my sense is where you can put them
in the car just drive around

22
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,330
so distribute this your senses twenties

23
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,760
lots of people with the term very high
motivation

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,220
to discover you know what's around them
and then create open maps

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,790
so these are on the director took your
jacket space

26
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,990
with the people working on the senses so

27
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,450
the sensor design we had was a for DC
but at the beginning to take a Geiger

28
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,080
counter

29
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,860
GPS user ID No to correct policies from
the gate Country aggregate

30
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,160
I mean get irked butts count use
processing on the netbook

31
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,590
and I am say 40s were fired

32
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,410
uploaded on 9 may come up simple for TB
frilly perky USB cable

33
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,410
get getting in the way of in the curry
popular

34
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:08,470
can make it smaller just keep forgetting
countered the GPS use an SD card

35
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,000
Arduino safe to fight may come up

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,200
now so on them

37
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,920
upper left -ism under very left is the

38
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,040
1 you can see the USB cable the first
prototype the second one is a

39
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,620
second in sensor so it's fixed to the
car

40
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,920
by winding the window onto stripes so
this is the same thing

41
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,060
there's a minor window to let Souder
edition through

42
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,219
and there what you obtain is a drive by
science

43
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:41,180
so I guess you from here we're a
drive-by I mean

44
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,890
my face covering stuff so we do that
with tradition you can too didn't

45
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:50,230
on bike or on foot so this was in the
exclusion zone

46
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,819
ever richest person going there to

47
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,879
collect data so

48
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,150
the some what's the efficiency of the
system it's a actually creates so we

49
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,730
started

50
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,810
roughly one month after the earthquake
after

51
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,900
um to three months we have a half
million measurements

52
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,200
today we're over five million points
it's there because their assets

53
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,819
that has a ever been corrected so we
have an API

54
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:23,499
and the EPA to take us that week so the
court is too I know in the future

55
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:24,639
crowdsourced

56
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,019
measurements people can upload their
fine there's a moderator system we we

57
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:29,670
can check

58
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,290
I'm enough he if if year we think it's
funny though not

59
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,279
and he said keep it on out so um
different option visualize it

60
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:43,480
may come up and/or have this is urs he
c0 basically is public domain you can

61
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,829
download the whole dataset

62
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:47,829
we hope it will be use for your science
by universities

63
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:52,409
in them research saw

64
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:56,889
we also do all the hardware to software
everything is open source

65
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:01,889
you can get the cat fight is the
firmware dermot visual isn't tools or

66
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:03,040
all of this is on the top

67
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,590
so please visit and if you like to
contribute

68
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:12,279
so this is there also a new
visualization so this is just depend oil

69
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:12,620
I mean

70
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,669
north of japan so there is a the power
plant

71
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:21,620
and there we can clearly see them Jessa
of the explosion due to weather patterns

72
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,910
and over here i think is Tokyo

73
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,430
song I mean

74
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,680
compared to having no information this
is arm

75
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,030
really helpful lots of people would have

76
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,350
band compete he I mean food there was
drawn into north of dependents or sodium

77
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,350
where all the agriculture happens but
actually you can see that

78
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,140
they do it's not such a clear case
capped pick up case

79
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,250
so really depending on very friendly and
mechanization

80
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,350
the situation is very different

81
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,550
now from revived equipment end

82
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,340
some we have a kit actually there will
be a four cent

83
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,900
swing on the other fruit is just are you
know with GPS summerall its green

84
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,150
SD card and their predictability about
reverse more

85
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,790
so hopefully this will be a islamic

86
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,760
we have also open source Geiger counter
so this is a hundred KKK country

87
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,610
ABM stickers

88
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,200
such a tease you can measure but the
sticker great source

89
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,370
edition measurements disease or thanks
to

90
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,460
but sovereignty is author pictures here
it's not a churchillian

91
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,960
much more people involved and

92
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,220
thank you
