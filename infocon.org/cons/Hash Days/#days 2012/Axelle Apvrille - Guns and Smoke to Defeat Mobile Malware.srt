1
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:12,739
so neither be i'm not excel abril

2
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:15,190
i'm waking at fortune that time there i
a m

3
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,420
mobileme where analysts

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,470
so just in case you don't know what that
means it means just like

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,289
just get them

6
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:22,730
an awful lot of them

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,499
mobile malware everyday

8
00:00:24,499 --> 00:00:27,920
generalize tends to dissemble

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,679
and uh...

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:36,380
hopefully to understand what they're
doing and effect after which of course

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,460
and i think you lecture you really about
mobile malware on and regular and all

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,580
that stuff

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,910
will be a very short and production of

14
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,730
what's the importance of their mobile
malware today

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,580
i think that probably all of you have
heard that really it's growing very fast

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,140
and grow it

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,970
i've got this nice charts they're
showing it keeps for and relate to the

18
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,230
uh... whitford regards to other
platforms

19
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,130
um... to be honest it's being

20
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,660
nearly over one year one year and a half

21
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,640
that people have been claiming debts

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,610
and row it is really uh...

23
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,220
full of malware

24
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,130
actually it's shorter than that

25
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,610
we sell other key to writing only like
six months or

26
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,310
at most one year ago

27
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,510
and before that we still have to turn
off a lot of mobile malware on sending

28
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,150
descendant baffling

29
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,690
because when people tend to forget is
that there is

30
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,550
maybe perhaps even now and now much more
cindy in films

31
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:41,710
into well-spent accurate frens

32
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,900
um... this is the kind of

33
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,620
mobile no way that we get

34
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,090
bizarre only recent ones those deaths

35
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,710
breakouts in nam

36
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,620
markets since the middle left for
september

37
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,670
week yet

38
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,500
lots of um...

39
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,280
told croats as soon as corporate though
that was our mobile malware that are

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,650
sending estimates to premium for members

41
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,939
and floppy get some

42
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:07,260
kind of substantial trade revenue from
from that

43
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,699
and the other kind of nowhere that we
see pretty much

44
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,779
is also spyware

45
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:18,159
and those are going to i've been out for
one reason or another

46
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,469
spider abstinence messages

47
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:22,810
spying indications by europe

48
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,239
call logs

49
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,869
who calls himself rosenblum browsing
blogs things like that

50
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:33,229
if at one time you want checks

51
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:37,369
whether the recent uh... mobile malware
that we're catching well you can go

52
00:02:37,369 --> 00:02:40,949
can be euro down there but he knows a
the recent

53
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:45,319
entries very recent countries

54
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:48,229
also the yet i think that uh... we're
seeing is that

55
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:49,160
lawsuits

56
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,819
there has been kind of a growth on
android and reagan always there

57
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:53,890
well now we can

58
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,649
we can see even some hits

59
00:02:55,649 --> 00:03:00,149
samak at the kind of the infection rate
which is the download heads that we have

60
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:02,489
four for those not wearing and really

61
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:05,379
and we see that well we getting some

62
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:10,510
on some a lot a lot of hits were a few
samples such as freud dream

63
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,259
princeton some on druid

64
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,399
and

65
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:17,240
something like twelve attracts shows
something like

66
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,379
between one hundred hits per month

67
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:23,020
by the fact is that it this is only
their heads

68
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,949
that we get through are for dates

69
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:30,929
uh... people who don't have forty kids
don't get any hits of course and only

70
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:33,849
twenty steps are enabled on the boxes so
it's

71
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:34,849
pretty much

72
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,669
uh... underestimated their wars

73
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:39,099
still means that to know

74
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:40,689
every month

75
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:43,529
people uh... a lot of people

76
00:03:43,529 --> 00:03:47,359
which are trying out either to downloads
not wearing

77
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:49,789
probably install it afterwards

78
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:53,579
getting infected when we were neither

79
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:54,959
so that's all about

80
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,919
what i'm really a

81
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:59,709
are they going to talk is more about in
our lab

82
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:01,769
uh... word fun stuff

83
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:02,950
on um...

84
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,389
android reverse engineering

85
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:09,780
i don't know at some of you where acts
yes things up

86
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,810
some of you were actin summing hatch now
which is another security conference

87
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,779
geneva

88
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:16,179
in march

89
00:04:16,179 --> 00:04:20,409
and psychoactive alex the kind that
usual tools that we are using when we

90
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:22,909
want to reverse and really

91
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:25,969
prompt others eighty k two

92
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:28,340
smalley back smalley

93
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,169
misconduct who

94
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,169
um...

95
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:33,280
you can download my slides there

96
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,340
today aren't going to uh...

97
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,940
to deal with some kind of a new step two
things a little bit more advance that

98
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,620
and some of those you haven't seen that
yet outside

99
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,229
in a in the well

100
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:48,660
well it's a bit don compilers

101
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:55,020
and also will be me playing pretty much
uh... with the text format

102
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,519
already discouraged

103
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,560
then i'll be doing it as sure demo and
also acted explaining a few stefan

104
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,919
attuned to date

105
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,289
uh... and later defection

106
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:11,390
uh... when your uh... mall where or when
you're

107
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,250
challenge

108
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,689
that that kind of stuff

109
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:19,099
seventy compilers

110
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:23,919
uh... i'd say four or main become
pioneers that not that we can miss

111
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,169
to let them or

112
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:26,860
not specifically pelvic

113
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,199
their specific to

114
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,550
jab at that instead of the compiler anti
j

115
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,180
and we've got some other is dead and
dad's

116
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,909
very similar name switcher

117
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:41,189
on a specific recovered but all all
those four can be usable lumber

118
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:42,669
andrew it nowhere

119
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:44,149
uh... to decompiler

120
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:46,590
gets some uh...

121
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,539
answer and i i i could speak to look at

122
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:52,699
so what i wanted to do here is um... i
took him

123
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:55,620
another recent malware and which speak
much

124
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,490
which was really um...

125
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:02,360
uh... with with how it's like one month
for live it more in france and it was

126
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,569
specially specifically a targeting
france so

127
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:10,819
we had uh... specifically bonnet excite
vincent price

128
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:14,389
anti cast all those four d compilers to
decompose

129
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:18,150
freddie standards not really so tricky
function

130
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,449
etc eachother

131
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:23,389
will have good a look at the differences

132
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:28,729
so this is what chava decompiler with
will output

133
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:30,729
i think it's quite okay the way you

134
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:33,549
it looks like

135
00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:37,909
the only thing which is a bit surprising
news though while trueblue groups that

136
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:41,029
he had a good beginning to pick up

137
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:44,690
don't really know why fat that is it's
their it's strange

138
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,780
and of course there are a few issues
that i can't mention there but ah... i

139
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,269
mean that i can show on the slightest
that's

140
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:51,759
chava decompiler

141
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,849
uh... is prone to crashing

142
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:57,479
so there it was a lot of functions that
it will say oh i'm sorry if i come to

143
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:01,569
compile they've become pilot i have a
managed care

144
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:05,680
sometimes you have to fall back to
another decompiler

145
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,370
d_j_

146
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,120
decompiler so it's the same function

147
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,349
same one

148
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:13,580
uh... looks like uh... it's a big
difference

149
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,610
i find this

150
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,500
perhaps a little bit more agree because
you've got a lot of goat use which is

151
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,860
not very nice for her to have a
programming

152
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,610
and also you've got to strange
inspection of the billiard beginning

153
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,389
monitor enter

154
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:30,229
uh... that is because that this is a
chevy decompiler and doesn't know the

155
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:33,400
specifics of fell through

156
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,329
uh... spot that one

157
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:37,360
with dad's

158
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,370
uh... well dad uh... i count show you
what its

159
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,740
it up because attached

160
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,270
on that section

161
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,330
sab

162
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,859
there's gets decide adi compiled another
function there

163
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:50,849
another one the seconds of second part

164
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:52,199
anne's

165
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,369
okay except that you've got a lot of
casts as you can see object object

166
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:59,290
are six get and um...

167
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,559
the brady a bulls

168
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:07,309
arnett main safeguards arson are six for
the sixth registered it's like that

169
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:09,550
maybe not to do it

170
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,039
event that that is um...

171
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:13,700
impeded actually uh...

172
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,080
most of the time and contra parts some
of you know that cool

173
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,179
and it gives also a pretty good to
outfits

174
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:24,759
except that it's a bit content link the
because uh...

175
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,300
everything has spurred a full powers

176
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,529
of uh... uh... uh... of the main up
everything

177
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:32,569
before it that you have calmed too

178
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:33,880
tune boy world of

179
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,010
who full

180
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:35,870
report dated

181
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,830
the actually met the function

182
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:44,080
so that's a bit sana lengthy and you've
got also always in nearly a every

183
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,330
function that it's uh... decompose

184
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,690
the synchronized keyword

185
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:54,260
which site don't know fights there over
time

186
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,590
um...

187
00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:00,570
the goal here is not to say that's uh...
one decompiler is actually better than

188
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,020
the other one it's more

189
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,750
fifty show you that there really some
specifics that some specific put but

190
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,340
they'll have with one decompiler end up
with another one

191
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,020
so that if you find something a bit
strange when you can compile win one

192
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,330
on he can now if it's just that it's
always out the link that kind of stuff

193
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,050
or if you have to pull back and try
another wants to see what

194
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:27,700
relieve it could would look like

195
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,540
so that so pretty compilers

196
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,880
the decks for naps

197
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,410
cedex is spelled h_ executables

198
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,320
and slight all um...

199
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,430
uh... foreign that's found five formats
will it starts with begins with them

200
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,940
got a header where you've got most of
the things and then you've got

201
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,710
uh...

202
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,430
plenty of the race

203
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,699
arrays which are full of indexes that
will actually points

204
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:56,710
through the last parts at the trial

205
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,060
five formats

206
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,060
which is the data section

207
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,470
let's say you rights and codes

208
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,940
and swim fighting all the hello welds

209
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,210
or the held on twelve th

210
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,590
and uh... the string itself will be in
the data section

211
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,690
down there

212
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,670
uh... on the end of yellow box

213
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,180
and you'll have this string of rank

214
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,810
or referenced that's string

215
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,580
and uh... provided index for him

216
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,940
everybody's using that's uh... that
strength there

217
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,980
if you have been a mathematics

218
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,990
i don't know gets my have my i_d_ or
something like that

219
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,510
well that also

220
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,270
for del ticket history

221
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,560
so you'll have it in them

222
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,070
uh... in pink yellow box that down there
interrogator section

223
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,810
and you'll have this ring your ready
reference

224
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,950
that strength

225
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,580
and you'll have as it's been that fed
still have two methods are ready

226
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,090
referenced

227
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,250
the string uh... this spring gea index

228
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,500
disfiguring

229
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,210
picks up it's a lot of

230
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,680
a lot of index is there to uh...

231
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,910
not repeat strings and only have strings
afterwards

232
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:10,110
in before

233
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,860
bellies are ten main references
speculate will continue to work

234
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,160
start playing with it that's perhaps

235
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,670
uh... when you have we're still have my
slides so

236
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,360
you cannot just click there

237
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,440
shoot them the references

238
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,780
um... sub we have to text formats and we
want most of the time what we want to do

239
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,290
is have a look at the header

240
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,180
so if you wanna have a look at the
header there's one food uh...

241
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,790
written by team spread theory

242
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,500
and it's not a very well-known killed
but you'll find them on his uh... on his

243
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,280
blog

244
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,869
at school decks info

245
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:46,770
it's very simple you jess

246
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,119
quote jab at tax info and provides a
text file

247
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:52,290
rifle read and outputs

248
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,550
uh... the header after the decks

249
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,450
he don't want to do it that way

250
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,900
you've also got

251
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,700
underlies switches protect and regards

252
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,450
uh... with an interesting interactive
uh... his picture out there

253
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,720
and you can tell it's

254
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,910
birthing

255
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,089
uh... load my

256
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:13,700
classes dot that's that that's the first
line of it

257
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,829
gets the header out those uh... that
file

258
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:18,390
and then print it

259
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,390
dot shows

260
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,220
and you cannot

261
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,530
see what you've got in there

262
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,189
likable uh...

263
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:26,740
uh... header file suit

264
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,020
it starts with uh... uh... magic

265
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,360
and a magic for at uh... that excel
frances

266
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,280
and most of the time on-scene zero
thirty five

267
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,910
actually down

268
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:43,560
specifications safety can be well if it
says that another number two

269
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:49,240
what we see is uh... zero thirty five
minutes of the time

270
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,580
if you want to pursue a bit more than
just uh...

271
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,520
the head and while you can use uh...
zero one zero editor

272
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,690
which is really uh...

273
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,030
very handy there

274
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,740
because it will you you know it's pure
text file

275
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,210
old selwyn

276
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,270
a text template

277
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,530
and then it will show side by side

278
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:14,460
one i've done that the formats and then
what's insights that particular part of

279
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,860
the format

280
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:21,820
so it's really very happy dietrich to
prestech swastika

281
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,710
if you want there's a third way to to
play with x_-files is uh... with andrew

282
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,720
card

283
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,020
because andrew garden has um...

284
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,420
implemented

285
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,359
um... just two sets of schools a set of
um...

286
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:38,160
of classes students retreat each parts
but the text file

287
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,260
you've got a class

288
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,420
to uh... uh...

289
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,749
to understand the heather that's called
header height and we've got a class for

290
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:46,799
the string ninety blistering there a
string fightin

291
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,910
predict types type item type idea ten

292
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,160
where for everything

293
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,390
parts of the time

294
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,090
ends

295
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:59,390
if he wants to debts one of those
objects one of those abject that those

296
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,519
costs as well

297
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:02,190
you just uh...

298
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:06,690
cool one f that the methods that you've
got get header i can get few idea temp

299
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:13,690
and so was the kind the same kind of
grain the coupon there

300
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,250
and once you've got

301
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,730
one of those objects well you've got
most of the time always the same nine

302
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,620
names of uh... functions that you can
use

303
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,670
to welch

304
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:29,470
to delay car swede or show what's in
uh... in fact uh... that object so you

305
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,080
can

306
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,170
show x

307
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,600
that means it will show that there's
assembly of its suburbs smalley code for

308
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,430
it

309
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,110
you can also uh...

310
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,530
prints done

311
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,700
aren't yet a decimal bites

312
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,900
or that part

313
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,499
let's get role forget for a welfare

314
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:46,170
get the robot arm

315
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,680
can also get it some

316
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,580
position and um...

317
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,509
and the phone so thats will be at the
offsets

318
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:54,470
gets the index

319
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,100
and you've got also of course some other
shortcuts

320
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,939
huge just want to do something with his
periya

321
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:06,340
typical such as uh... read old strengths
that are indiana and the textile

322
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:12,510
wealth and to school function point get
strings that protect people

323
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,180
but first

324
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,680
uh... seems perhaps a bit difficult
remain alert you remember all the names

325
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,340
of the functions the very cool thing
with its is that when you're using and

326
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,930
realize it's an interactive shell and
you've got some completion for commands

327
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,360
so you just started

328
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,920
uh... rights type in the beginning of
the command and you'll have to rest of

329
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,700
it so

330
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,760
appear

331
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,100
which is very good

332
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,389
those are just a few examples there if
you want to list all

333
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:43,019
the classes for instance in that in the
decks phone

334
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,570
so let's get classes them wall

335
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,990
do you want to get all methods the

336
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,350
this time you just do our very very
short hyphen

337
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,880
commands forgets

338
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,350
or the methods for the given acted in
film show

339
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,570
or or pets

340
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:04,730
uh... all or backing up for that method

341
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,590
that's all for

342
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,390
but that part

343
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,280
so now we're gonna see kind of the use
case

344
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,320
if u

345
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,380
months ago

346
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,820
um... back slabs released a challenge

347
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,970
uh... which was

348
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:23,270
really interesting there and it concerns
uh... obfuscating bytecode

349
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,030
what they were doing fairy is that's
actually they were hiding

350
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,990
uh... the real payloads

351
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:33,260
hope uh... out that the real code of
uh... i think challenge

352
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,100
insides something bad would look like
they're paid and to have enough and

353
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,270
every

354
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,880
and that

355
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,529
right parts them

356
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:45,410
dite brown parts

357
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,199
so if you were just

358
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,360
these are some link the codes

359
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,340
uh... instruction by instruction

360
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,320
you would see first ago to you

361
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,490
and say okay it's just to go to

362
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,509
then you see

363
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:59,000
the filler ray data instruction

364
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,380
and you say oh i'm gonna have a and
they're ready and then you'd read the

365
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:06,140
other instructions within their which
are at the payload you would read them

366
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,880
as potatoes

367
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,510
has felt the contents of the error rate
and not those really instructions uh...

368
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,630
tell the construction

369
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,610
on the contrary

370
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,020
sab gifted swine yeah

371
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,410
on the country icky

372
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,480
uh... disassemble and feel a bit more

373
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,110
intelligent of the way your kids are
selling and you see that the first go to

374
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,900
is always going to after

375
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,130
so here here what happens is that

376
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,830
until you xc

377
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:37,970
ibogaine bold b zero because he was the
zero

378
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,890
that is always going to happen

379
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,680
we are going to skip nine words later

380
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,280
west nine

381
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,560
words that weekend escape eighteen bites
later

382
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,020
and that just happens to fall

383
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,420
at the beginning of the payload upto

384
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,070
supposedly uh... every hour

385
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,490
they didn't break

386
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:02,480
you will reap the city contato as real
davek instructions and that's just as a

387
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,300
payload open and fair

388
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,280
so the waves

389
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,720
uh...

390
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,620
uh...

391
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,430
the office should wait the challenge was
so there

392
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,750
was too

393
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,130
with you know we're using andrew card

394
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,490
was to say okay we're gonna

395
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,400
have its and have that there's a somber
points

396
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,880
she did beginning at the payload and
brick on the talents

397
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,580
uh... what you have a look at speeds
ah... specific index so

398
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,040
the method is called sets

399
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,650
codes index

400
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,090
and we tell it to go

401
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,190
eighteen bite later eighteen bites later

402
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,620
and it will start and disassemble it
that part

403
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,289
and that way we could see

404
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:48,340
while the real that they'll be code so
it's not certain he builds

405
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,620
uh... strings

406
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,860
and

407
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,280
uh... then it will get cell the
application context

408
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,640
so that's a nice solution that were
expect actually um... set code index was

409
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,850
returned to you specifically to meet you
solve the challenge

410
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:08,520
and um... i think it wasn't really uh...
it wasn't necessary

411
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,580
could it is this possible to uh... sold
the challenge

412
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,950
it's especially function

413
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,250
and i'm going to show you now

414
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,520
and it is also well

415
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,700
possible

416
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,450
with uh... my solution to actually
disassemble

417
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,190
in a text file at anne offset

418
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,220
you choose the offset and people
disaster multipart

419
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,470
persecute you did not set that does not
mean any meaningful or forster just in

420
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,370
cuba's assemble crap

421
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,670
but if he if you want you can just put
it at that time

422
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,390
he accepts or

423
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:46,779
points that you wish to disassemble

424
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:50,750
this is the other way to do it

425
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,630
basically in that case what we wanted to
do with this

426
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,820
that's right is juditha semel at the
offsets

427
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,900
which is at the beginning of dozen

428
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,029
brown box at the bottom

429
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:07,830
but when we are in the in the methods
the beginning of the neck beds

430
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,399
anais contained within the structure
which is called a code i can

431
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:15,919
and at the beginning you've got plenty
of um... x_-two where he was there

432
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,130
that's grown hold the register size
besides pretty inputs for the outputs

433
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,430
plenty of other stuff

434
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,869
and all of that takes

435
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:25,400
sixteen baat

436
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,600
okay so we're gonna have to

437
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,139
osb i we can get stale location at the
beginning of kodak m pedestal

438
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:33,380
code offset

439
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,500
and we've got to

440
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,429
skipped sixteen bytes

441
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:42,600
and then left you skip again nine word
spanish-speaking buy ticket

442
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,600
less eighty

443
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,820
and then what it what i have done is
actually dumper rights

444
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,850
uh...

445
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,830
if true

446
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,629
for andrew card which is just uh... pipe
and uh...

447
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,539
helpers and help a script

448
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,610
that will disassemble at any upset that
i give

449
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,610
uh... in uh... for further thanks bob

450
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,929
and regard as open-source

451
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:09,240
uh... so i will um...

452
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,059
uh... i will send out three and
restricted them in sympathy

453
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:15,520
include it in uh...

454
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,280
in uh... the repository

455
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,320
plan to wake up

456
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,740
as i said and at standard time

457
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:31,740
uh...

458
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,690
there we go

459
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,850
with night and nice big font so that
everybody can re

460
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,990
okay

461
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,890
so without on what we're gonna do is
something to show you technique

462
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,390
that parts

463
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,350
live

464
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,840
and i'm going to lunch

465
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,919
and record

466
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,190
there it goes

467
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,240
and sam track ni after skater

468
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,679
is sent them

469
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:04,120
effects lapsed challenge

470
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,899
cocaine so i don't remember exactly main
their ego biking

471
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:09,270
use completion

472
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:14,390
analyze eighteen

473
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,529
boxes future

474
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:17,720
parents

475
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:23,630
like to specify also which decompiler i
want to excuse ukbhat which c huge it's

476
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:27,179
complan

477
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,630
and i think you carry

478
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,500
eighty k ab puts out three three
different outputs which will

479
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,870
killing the very gables eighteen-year
tns

480
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:39,510
and independent things with its clients
interesting

481
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:43,230
for instance i can show you which is the
main activity of challenge

482
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,240
okay x

483
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,000
the drop activity

484
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,270
i can show also

485
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,960
commissions

486
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,750
what is it uh... doing

487
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,090
i think using the internet

488
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:58,630
permission

489
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,700
that's just

490
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,610
part of the clippings that we can do

491
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:07,480
now we're going to have a look at more
specifically

492
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,750
wrote uh... the activity that were
considered quick so we said that west

493
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,320
drop activity

494
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,340
and we can see inspect for the methods
that we have fared

495
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,720
so

496
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,040
one-line really interested uh... in
school exit

497
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,000
work

498
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,530
sherwood

499
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,470
so

500
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:34,170
now it's not marry there its really

501
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,450
and

502
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,210
here we go

503
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,770
so we have here

504
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:47,560
exactly what we are d compiling and we
see that we have a film array data

505
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,370
and the filter rate

506
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,510
uh... taylor wrote

507
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,070
and it doesn't look

508
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:57,750
she's like that and wheat that they go
to exception they go to www instruction

509
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,669
sorry

510
00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:00,260
which is down there

511
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,420
at the bottom

512
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,750
if you tried to do to use the decompiler

513
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,600
it's not going to work

514
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,969
because of course doesn't understand
very much out the facts

515
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:16,420
beta payments i hope we get to know

516
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,110
now if we

517
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,300
do with the oficial away

518
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,419
we set stick coach right y-axis

519
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:24,299
we say

520
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:30,530
expo and we do that again

521
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:34,169
so that then it works and we see diddy
compiled code remains

522
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:36,510
delete much more readable there

523
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,200
right you want to have a look at it

524
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,200
means nari

525
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,820
that is pippen's also

526
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:54,820
completely different

527
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,040
where you've got them

528
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,470
the strings that we're building at the
beginning

529
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:09,290
begin and getting right the application
complex

530
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,000
i'll do it my way

531
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,760
so i had to reset that's so that i'm not
cheating

532
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,560
ticket back to psychics era

533
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:24,570
ends um...

534
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:31,260
yes this is a bit lengthy and connery
units exit methods and see

535
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,399
at the commencement

536
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:37,529
now i need to get the upsets at the
beginning of my

537
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:40,270
methods so

538
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:47,270
here

539
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,700
rights gets code

540
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,910
summary

541
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,310
two hundred then

542
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,670
nine hundred

543
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,110
replace them

544
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,740
ni he canceled so to link them

545
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,750
of um... the code lock-step we have see
how much of we've gone there at the

546
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,140
compound

547
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,360
so get jones gets

548
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,260
it's side so that's the

549
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,669
science of instructions that we have

550
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:38,070
we have one hundred uh... that's there

551
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,800
i'm going to be compile

552
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,530
decompiler first thank you know i need
to get stay takes on our heads an

553
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,560
isolated case so

554
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,789
what's uh... effects of the pixies

555
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:51,370
rickets

556
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:54,370
and expects

557
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,489
and then in might actually have the

558
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:57,149
role

559
00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:02,169
buffer birth defects father insights
that eight to ten

560
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:04,610
and are used in judge t

561
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,880
and

562
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,450
is one hundred inmates

563
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,910
minus nine

564
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:13,000
look as we said we're skipping nine
words

565
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,670
then my texts

566
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:18,200
and i feel that working week so it's two
hundred and nine

567
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,610
hundreds

568
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,650
thus i said we're skipping sixteen bytes

569
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:27,010
sixteen bytes for coverage is to student
that signs and everything

570
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:31,289
and then eighteen banks because uh...
that's

571
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:35,340
uh... aware we're pointing to quitting
at the early

572
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,889
and

573
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,730
this is just around them

574
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,500
uh...

575
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,880
stuff working you stopped reading

576
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,929
and use

577
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:47,880
condition

578
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,560
the result of this

579
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:55,190
there it goes

580
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,500
you can see again

581
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,720
into components

582
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,130
brian we've got the stream

583
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:03,060
needs uh... building the string

584
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:07,149
uh... getting the application thanks for
that

585
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:09,159
so that's the way to do it

586
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:12,690
with andrew park without much grief and
if you want to do it in a bit more

587
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,050
quickly

588
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:17,190
with the script

589
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,420
sucks up

590
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,960
bluebirds

591
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,289
and i called it and wrote this for

592
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:23,810
assembly

593
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,010
kuttab very quick

594
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,279
helper for the um...

595
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,570
usage

596
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,580
so input is the text file

597
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,980
so protects uh... news

598
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,059
kingpins

599
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:39,960
victory

600
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,049
x there

601
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:44,460
and the offset so it's two one nine

602
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,640
nine hundred

603
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,080
for sixteen

604
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,920
stating so thats that's

605
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,600
c for it

606
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:01,600
and there we go

607
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,429
okay string builder again recognize them

608
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:10,600
the real okay

609
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,389
etzel them out

610
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:16,160
that tda

611
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:23,160
uh... to your slides

612
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,130
that was in case the demo did not work
to see

613
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:35,200
at the back of sites

614
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,510
now we saw how to play with the text
file

615
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:44,090
and on all that kind of steps uh... if
we have played and modified a textile

616
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:48,590
it's not going to work straightaway
afterwards because there isn't a heather

617
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,320
uh...

618
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,269
extract some

619
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:51,650
and the hatch

620
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,650
word the pics

621
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:58,179
so if you wanted to be a acceptable
afterwards for the andrew firm while you

622
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:01,240
have to preach accent and to recap

623
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,590
so i've written as a very small to that
is on them

624
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:08,520
it had thirty one q you have a look at
it but it's really nothing extraordinary

625
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,880
expense

626
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,169
rehashing recheck intakes something fair
critics admit it's handy in those cases

627
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:15,409
do

628
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:17,720
when you've rehash tips

629
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,510
dan if you want to repackage dat k

630
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:24,269
it's also very simple you just get you
really need to get all the ingredients

631
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:28,649
so you get started modified classes that
that

632
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:33,600
you also get everything all the other
things that you need which is the assets

633
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,520
uh... the resources the android
manifests

634
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,580
musical of deaths and then yuki worked
the charts i know that

635
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:47,580
it's quite so um... simple to do with
with the way to make make function

636
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,710
um...

637
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:53,620
on a totally different aspect well im
sometimes also we are when you're

638
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,240
when we're analyzing my malware

639
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,409
and things like that it's useful to know
our

640
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:00,200
device i t

641
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,960
so

642
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,850
if you want to know your device on t_v_
the easiest way to do is his right to

643
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,060
sample application hands

644
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,470
uh... on square what's and records and
rates

645
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,890
underscore i_d_

646
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,429
and justice playing it

647
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:15,610
that's one of the easiest way

648
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:19,830
if you're not into well application
writing and you don't want

649
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,970
to do that

650
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,279
the other way to do with this you get a
shell

651
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,670
on uh... on your device

652
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:31,080
and sit down you uh... though into uh...
a database status quo settings

653
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,910
and look for the security of olympia and
there's also a field called enjoyed

654
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,649
underscore heidi

655
00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:37,690
and keep him

656
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,750
either reads

657
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,299
uh... the value-free that's fair

658
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:46,920
and if your groups you can also modify
it

659
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,830
some other interesting stuff i think is
um...

660
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,010
if anything

661
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:54,170
and later took action

662
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:59,390
because we have of course well sometimes
now effects

663
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:04,610
don't want us to be your seemed to be
looked into from from and then later

664
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:09,390
behaved badly differently on the in the
later and on the real defiance

665
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:13,020
on the other hides went from a nice
point-of-view it's very cool t_b_ using

666
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,420
and then later kickass them

667
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,340
you know the devices

668
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:23,690
don't always uh... happened seemed to
work uh... the way you expect expected

669
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:24,480
um...

670
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,330
to be

671
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:31,190
yellow intermittent time the you it's by
checking for system properties and date

672
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:36,320
look for d expected values that or and
original laters well return

673
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,260
i for instance aren't they will say that
the predict named as an sti kato

674
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,220
diffident brown's generate all that
stuff so they'll check for that

675
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,740
and if it has been a

676
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,860
specifi cally for tea and later we'll
financing well

677
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,330
sorry this is an then later i'm going to
do with this trip that instead of

678
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:55,750
my normal behavior

679
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,039
they can do that on the coding uh...

680
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:00,630
and fermentation cuoi point of view

681
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:04,000
either by calling faye kept dropped
man's

682
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,360
that's from the shell

683
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,230
or uh... from

684
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:12,400
uh... the method called gets in the
system properties so

685
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,580
box

686
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,840
now this is done

687
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,070
uh... attract me

688
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:23,130
that was uh... out from uh... begin
inspect theory

689
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,440
their and as you can see eddings

690
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,509
detecting

691
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:30,120
it's running on and then a and later

692
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,030
and as i want to cancel the challenge
and i wanted to do with uh... constantly

693
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,710
etcetera

694
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,130
rick at that it doesn't detect

695
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,140
yene a leader

696
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:45,000
we so that it's just a checking for done
the property and stare so

697
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,269
what are we going to do what we have to
understand

698
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:50,660
how the properties are being returns

699
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,909
from in architecture point of view

700
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:56,870
if you get the properties you've got to
entry points either you get your getting

701
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,820
it from

702
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,639
get prop

703
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:00,510
which is spanish alka mam cell

704
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,170
sits on the rights

705
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:05,110
uh... site at uh... at the slides

706
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:09,820
and then it will go into that is
implemented actually ended toolbox parts

707
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,609
of it

708
00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:16,239
ands indiana it goes down to betsy utils

709
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,259
if you're using um...

710
00:34:18,259 --> 00:34:22,039
uh... system properties that dot gets
from a few

711
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:23,720
orthodontic framework

712
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,389
affair the ritual machines then

713
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:32,459
it is going to andrea system properties
tend to um... g_m_ night parked at that

714
00:34:32,459 --> 00:34:34,429
and then relying at the bottom

715
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:36,709
weekend holly plays

716
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:38,299
of course

717
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:40,049
what we're going to do

718
00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:43,329
agreed on a poker

719
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:46,839
gets properties function at slips you
thoughts level

720
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,370
okay and whenever somebody is asking for

721
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:52,049
i dunno or grow products' proms

722
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:54,479
we're not going to pretend generate
butts

723
00:34:54,479 --> 00:34:59,329
either something real that you can see
or or whatever name a and i think that's

724
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:03,929
uh... actually did challenge or than
ours nothing to recognizes

725
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:08,259
and something apart the piano

726
00:35:08,259 --> 00:35:11,539
it's not actually gotta work if you

727
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:15,929
all system properties that lexi utils
there is one property

728
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:18,019
row colonel q n u

729
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:19,640
that you cannot cook

730
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,030
glitzy utils levels because if you do

731
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:24,369
yen labor's not going to bootable

732
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:28,579
so this one you've got to okay phil
effective just the later above

733
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:30,699
but the general level

734
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:35,669
and once you've done that

735
00:35:35,669 --> 00:35:39,419
when she bent that for what you have to
do is of course he recompile your and

736
00:35:39,419 --> 00:35:43,429
later

737
00:35:43,429 --> 00:35:50,429
it's not detecting uh... it's of running
on piano later

738
00:35:51,379 --> 00:35:53,950
less by dole so we're very much
concerned with

739
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,820
uh... when where

740
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,899
analyzing mobileme where is the process
and that's

741
00:35:58,899 --> 00:36:01,989
we wanted in teaching now what's

742
00:36:01,989 --> 00:36:05,969
the phone is going to sense is awsome
asks what it's going to receive all that

743
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:07,759
kind of stuff

744
00:36:07,759 --> 00:36:10,429
so aunty estimates nine which will

745
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:12,660
the cell phone is always coming taking
with

746
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:17,009
what we call the national center and
senate seat

747
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,319
it freezing

748
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:19,240
uh...

749
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,519
and and and write them later

750
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:26,980
well what happens is that we can bury
easily uh... read what's

751
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:33,279
ivy emulator is sending assets from espy
just having a look at the radio locks

752
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:34,780
and some of the system nuns

753
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,849
command they didn't like that

754
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:39,099
uh... slash the radio

755
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:43,079
and we can reach uh... whats going out
there we see the s in this

756
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:46,319
uh... and pete you format

757
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:50,329
if we want to send an estimate as to
uh... kendrick and recruit them we use

758
00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:52,379
telnet

759
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:55,339
summits to it again later

760
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:58,059
that's helpful tips that works

761
00:36:58,059 --> 00:37:01,339
that's just what it looks like if you
wanna have a look at them

762
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:04,710
repeat you that's the people you love
them

763
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:10,609
uh... apa nasa mass

764
00:37:10,609 --> 00:37:14,959
we can also use some uh... some other
uh... uh... libraries that we've got a

765
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,219
python

766
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:19,009
messaging library that will that helps
you were

767
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:23,150
and codes ah... drive from tee and read
and lakers

768
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,339
perspective

769
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:28,739
uh... t_v_ news so it for and killed by
some estimates andy kohut

770
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:32,379
uh... to deliver part

771
00:37:32,379 --> 00:37:37,159
so that's what ki and what it looked
looks like if you want to uh...

772
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:40,829
uh... teaches sentiments immense from
morrow

773
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:42,179
life and rich

774
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:45,499
week that part

775
00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:48,000
but actually it's not very helpful in
our case well for

776
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,880
promote on our analyst because what we
really want to do with not skew and

777
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,769
killed an estimate submit

778
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:55,490
but we want to decode it

779
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:58,770
and the other way around for the
estimates delivery wants to and killed

780
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,249
it

781
00:37:59,249 --> 00:38:03,689
those parts are not included in python
messaging

782
00:38:03,689 --> 00:38:06,739
so if we want to decode

783
00:38:06,739 --> 00:38:09,209
uh... the people use grandsons

784
00:38:09,209 --> 00:38:13,899
what we can do is use another tool which
is called to use fine

785
00:38:13,899 --> 00:38:16,199
memphis is a when those two

786
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:20,579
if you're crystalline interdict or unix
i think that also works in a

787
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:22,689
with winds down

788
00:38:22,689 --> 00:38:27,329
and it won't get detailed bad if you do
you and show you that phone number about

789
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:30,689
all the details that are included in the
past india cements

790
00:38:30,689 --> 00:38:35,489
the phone number and of course the body
of film appearances

791
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:37,809
or you can use of course in online
decoder

792
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:40,509
at work students are a few support there

793
00:38:40,509 --> 00:38:45,519
act on the web

794
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:48,449
i think that's balboa um... i'd just

795
00:38:48,449 --> 00:38:50,440
uh... wish to mention the force that
uh...

796
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,899
uh... designed to mandrake challenge

797
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:57,239
uh... still up out and run in the far
east

798
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:58,799
ends

799
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:02,779
if you're in the first one to find the
solution and bringing to protective

800
00:39:02,779 --> 00:39:05,209
which is

801
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:12,019
uh... value of the coupley lucky to have
to win that report states

802
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:16,190
that happened uh... the challenges
downloadable from that uh... hash days

803
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,929
website she if you want their

804
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:22,319
and hopefully things that i state their
perhaps help you

805
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:26,079
solve it for not for i hope anyway
you'll have heather at that time

806
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,379
looking at the talents and listening to
people

807
00:39:29,379 --> 00:39:31,009
and this is all well

808
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:32,650
right details it's uh...

809
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,479
want to contact me you know

810
00:39:34,479 --> 00:39:35,729
later

811
00:39:35,729 --> 00:39:39,289
for a cassette for others

812
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:42,449
i think we perhaps have time a little
bit free christians that sen
