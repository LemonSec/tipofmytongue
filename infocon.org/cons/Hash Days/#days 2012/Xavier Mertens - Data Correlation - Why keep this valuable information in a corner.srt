1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,299
if um grafton everybody so we are cool
so the and the

2
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:13,480
conference so I hope but I really did
bring your attention during the next 50

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:13,910
minutes

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,840
I'm what we talked today is a boat a

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,099
the value of the information that you
can extract for you different secret a

6
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:21,830
device that

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,369
everybody a few operates on the on the
on the tricks um

8
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,509
I will try to prove you that's a

9
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:33,360
it's very important reviews this
information and to try to

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,810
injecting all the device to to be more
active

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,289
when you have a secret incident for
example so

12
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:43,680
first seeking protection so when I'm I
need to cut the Americans

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,699
um I'm active on Twitter using

14
00:00:46,699 --> 00:00:48,000
the

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,270
Belgium blowfish sorry I always use the
same

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,070
about us with very easy to find me back
on the Internet a

17
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,140
I'm doing just like almost most people
he love consistency during my

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,900
they took and I'm secretly broker doing
tonight and

19
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,210
just also for information I ok organizer
of the group consequat conference

20
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,860
in Belgium um

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,369
I'm presenting today a personal research

22
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,670
fleet means a my home free if nothing to
do with the

23
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,340
the presentation so that's the classic a
slight a

24
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,060
IFE feel free to read it but it's quite
common um

25
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,860
we first %uh talk about some facts so
what is the current situation

26
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,070
on the on only on the tricks today other

27
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,270
some then I we present to books

28
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,729
an I would finish with different example
just the one we mark

29
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:44,039
I Michael almost something

30
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:46,110
a

31
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,540
it's not the typical torque I would
present the colleagues ample

32
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,900
but I we'll provide you a books ready to
be used

33
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,670
why because everybody use different kind
of reward different kind of devices

34
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:01,500
so for me it's almost impossible to drop
something ready for

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,500
on everybody in this room so we can
remain

36
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,899
a very three to go but Mike

37
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:12,319
my my goatee 3d when you will go outside
this room at the end of the presentation

38
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,810
we had maybe some nice

39
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,569
I East and you withdrawn hope to
implement Bassick

40
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:22,060
three from the stuff and interesting um

41
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,250
defense yes I think so I consider myself

42
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,540
us %uh no fancy another defensive guy

43
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,370
office he security is very important yes
break the weekend

44
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,750
route to a server we can break into none
on the play in San that's always funny

45
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,080
to

46
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,209
to see with roots into get to control
the device

47
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:43,310
but differences defense & Security is
also

48
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,980
very sunny for me because its also very
important to be

49
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,019
pro not be I'll if somebody tries to

50
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:53,829
attack me I was able to take the guy to
take the right confer measuring

51
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:57,299
I'm so I was the phone text okay that's
the

52
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:00,549
the best the best way for key for that's
my they could they took

53
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:03,769
and find any you have also know your
hand

54
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:07,680
so it means a by learning the techniques
up all the bad guy

55
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,360
youth will be able to better define
yourself so

56
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,079
I I'm reworking although on the
defensive side

57
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:18,950
um I'm working from

58
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,430
for I'm when living in Belgium working
Belgium an

59
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,040
in fact Belgium is so fun when the awful
lot of difference

60
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,390
nice nice stuff Belgian waffles of
course Belgian beers

61
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,859
legend morsels very nice secret
conference like he

62
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:37,359
in for two months butts also Belgium

63
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:40,480
us a very complicated political
situation

64
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,269
everybody I won't to a conference a lot
of people ask you by the way

65
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:49,180
the spring semester a government no yes
we have

66
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,280
for almost 10 were a 11 year the summit
but your

67
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,489
thats UN you understand why so

68
00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:00,530
one-year an institution is almost back
to one or must we should but we still

69
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,630
left different

70
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,940
like incident different a link which
Belgium with

71
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,540
french-speaking guy Dec speaking I and
also some kind of german-speaking I

72
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,730
in now in green butts it means what what
what's for Neils over by Jim but

73
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,540
the bench in Moto is in French renewal
fee to Fox yes that's strange

74
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,790
which we can translate in English Mike
unity makes strength

75
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,680
and for me this moto was a very
beautiful TT

76
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,780
to these look the same the store can do
slights

77
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,940
because we can apply the same

78
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,169
model to information security so I

79
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:40,020
when I found the small picture I me a
PSA

80
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,810
this is the perfect representation the
perfect resume a of my torque

81
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,810
because with plenty of small fishes
weekend back

82
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,139
be the black truck

83
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:53,530
so really weekend take all these I the
keels

84
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,070
every day we can put them together and
try to 6

85
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,620
the situation to see the security issue
so

86
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,300
what are the situation in more social
network to the let something like this

87
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,050
I'm pretty sure so yes plenty of
different devices

88
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,470
which can be open source weekend which
can be commercial solution with my

89
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,630
religious them proxies IDS

90
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,639
firewalls and all this device were quite
perfectly

91
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,590
the so I'm I will not support both
endorse but

92
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,770
almost we can be sure that you by Friday
war between work if we do the job quite

93
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,380
perfectly

94
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,620
an or does the vice date take actions on
the networks will defy all

95
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,150
see some a packet coming from in like
that dressy 3

96
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,970
drop the packet and ideas with me maybe
send the TCP reset

97
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,940
DC got to resupply in three sets over
the proxy we deny Texas we speak

98
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,440
this week you either for on a brosser
and about around the disease we saw a

99
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,030
pic nice

100
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,150
action she did take some suspicious
connectivity with a control center of

101
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,009
so but what's very

102
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:01,419
annoying for me with the different red
lights

103
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:05,229
click me that all those compliments are
wrecking some kind of seals

104
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:09,610
so what does it mean with me being your
organization with the patent

105
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,219
the team which my neck if I also all the
guys

106
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:16,639
my st. IDEs you have also different
foods

107
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,830
that the console for you I yes counsel
for your proxy

108
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,120
unique through to maybe have different
procedures so it's very very difficult

109
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,030
to manage

110
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,960
and increase the north of everybody
because the situation

111
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,400
a few years ago today we can say that's

112
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,530
we have a new brand new thought for a
few years which is cool seem

113
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,270
secret information and even management

114
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,949
thats rearm a big story

115
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:49,419
which he said both collect orthodox
because or the different components

116
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:53,069
generate looks so when the firewall
drops the connection three right and

117
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:53,870
even

118
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,539
and that yes we do the same a proxy but
once again we have the same problem

119
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:01,580
locks ice different formats dust all the
different

120
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,780
a basis in flat fis just think using
different kind of broke the coast SNMP

121
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,400
Cisco I don't know so the next it was
too

122
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,409
generate a pic that the base with or
your looks

123
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:18,099
which are collected no man I so that's a
cool off the seam

124
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:21,139
and this solution will help you search

125
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:25,370
and to generate nice report you would so
for example for

126
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,800
arm a suspicious IP address and you will
see that

127
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,259
dislike congress a security fence in for
the fight all the ideas maybe the proxy

128
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,569
a connection with you on a UNIX over

129
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:40,939
on as the %uh peace over until 60 it's
very easy to growth

130
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:45,120
the locks and to extract some
interesting information

131
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,460
but we have weakness

132
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,620
so that's a resume yield the prison
brick dislike for this independent

133
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,159
solutions

134
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:58,860
so remember the red lines read that the
place so we'll it's impossible to make

135
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,800
those device at the moment to talk to
each other

136
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,939
we have also stopped the corporation's
if we need to change something if I

137
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:07,639
won't you need to feel

138
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,060
can regress you need to be must be
approved by manager or team leader which

139
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,289
we passed a guy

140
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:16,580
having angle to keep both before the
changes its

141
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,650
their youth process looks arts and
tonight's

142
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,819
only the looks so it means that the real
the thoughts and the

143
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:28,150
yet the action that we could take up on
the front rise at the moment

144
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,400
there is no global protection if I only
do the job

145
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,260
on Heath's boss because he predicted
games at the group predicts

146
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,020
a a specific lower sites

147
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,690
an a real protection

148
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,240
sry it's not easy because when somebody
to text

149
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,640
and the fact nesime which is were

150
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,140
based on mobile the most seem
configuration

151
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,770
if you detect an attack first is always
good because a lot of singing from the

152
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,230
Sun

153
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,710
I'm not working properly and if you
detect in the factory

154
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,270
too late because to me ok touring the
guy

155
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:09,279
which use the Ono the fray or released
in his book The Sims so it's forty

156
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,380
its unmanageable

157
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,279
butts we have I good news for you

158
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:19,430
yes a lot of that that which are very
valuable in your

159
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,830
your in your devices some kind of

160
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,610
that are I get missus username you ever
else

161
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:31,150
domain names you can fly some I just and
the five shy one so

162
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,370
plenty of information and this
information so the store somewhere

163
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,080
in all those devices so the gooey 3b

164
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,630
to process them the with motion

165
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:46,750
in a more efficient way we can also if
that the coming from multiple sources

166
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,040
online repositories so internet house
full of interesting website where you

167
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,960
can download

168
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,050
you for the formation we see that there
for example

169
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,540
least the doubt because of money shoes
domain names used by

170
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,770
book makes sense on level so in turn on
resources

171
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,370
of course in you different government
and also

172
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,440
automatic process because you can
already generate

173
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,740
evens based on correlation you've seen
for you know that Dez

174
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,000
IP address its many shoes because three
so the IP address

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,700
in this even the season DC so

176
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,050
thats the good news we already have to
rule Mata

177
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,580
to implement this a

178
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,650
the first of all these we need to use
the data

179
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:33,270
an awful to use these data we will go
back to the

180
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,620
the roots of it. every everybody knows
you like the thats

181
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,470
the we have process so we have input
data

182
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,480
a process read them process them into
the originate

183
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,960
or the to its exactly the same in this
Lee

184
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,610
but the most important unique life good
input that that all the rice will never

185
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,090
have good results

186
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,900
on the on the other sites so it's very
very important to be able

187
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,220
to collect property the formation on the
left to generate

188
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,610
right up

189
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,210
what they would explain to the there is
nothing brink new

190
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,390
so sinks yours a everybody you

191
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,880
was strained to exchange data between
the picket fence

192
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,780
I was a big fan of the Commodore Amiga a
computer

193
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,360
an when I N one when they use %um
together was already

194
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,810
a link which court rx to implement it
clean

195
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,620
the 87 so it's quite a few years ago

196
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,710
this link which was able to make
application

197
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,830
talk to each other using specific some
kind of the by

198
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,080
so and the petition rich hot a

199
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,120
Rex interface was able to send the
thought to know the one what we see if

200
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,730
some comments to be every owns the sick
with you can cost for example

201
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,700
or um the

202
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,950
a painting program that we give that
some bone

203
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,600
a example thanking program should be
able to draw a line to see

204
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,810
rx draw a line from called on the extent
then

205
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,370
to 2020 friends at the program we draw
the line so you would be able to script

206
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,190
into at more or more automation to
obligation that's exactly the same

207
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:19,380
to the nothing if you need to implement

208
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,790
this kind of for all solutions for the
poor books and to extract more value

209
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,820
doubt some very important step to to
keep in mind first

210
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,980
security it's a big market so all
devices that you with by

211
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,680
fuels or every day they cost lot

212
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,340
a lot of money so it means that if you
invested lot of

213
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,370
a a huge amount of money to see vices

214
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,390
the goal is to use them much as possible

215
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,800
an I like to use the yeah give the
Microsoft Office

216
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,240
effect use as much as possible all the
features

217
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,070
everybody in this room is using
Microsoft Office Microsoft Excel for

218
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,840
phone with are you sure that you all the
features presents

219
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,170
in get petition I'm using work right my
reports

220
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,900
I make some able some with find some
lighting system

221
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,380
pictures but now Lingfield think there's
some features that

222
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,610
even I don't know white and I don't you
so

223
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,810
in this month I'm run look into the
condition to see what's

224
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,060
Yankees this some backdoor we say
something to fit that you can reuse this

225
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,060
is very important

226
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,310
that's why me too

227
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:32,100
invest so this time and maybe go back to
your friend or studio provided see

228
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,560
okay I know that I've this a petition
the sofa

229
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,740
sufferance could you give me more
information what's the database for

230
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,490
months why located Mike Baker

231
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,850
arm the seafood extract this kind of
thing for my son

232
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,570
a usually the Vandals they will buy

233
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,830
that we said you sorry the the solution
and a week that we

234
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,870
always try to keep the business for them
so they win

235
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,570
never communicate the information but
they have console

236
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,990
back from from the beginning they have
some from online tools day some

237
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:07,440
he didn't feature the company very
useful to implement what we see

238
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,510
soon and finally be a hacker

239
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:16,580
sleep me that list were down only 3x and
make it work like you want after all

240
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,640
bike the Zeiss its use your device will
you are free to do whatever you want

241
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:20,950
with it

242
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:26,050
of course left licensees with end-user
license agreement and send those who

243
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:26,870
wait price

244
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,980
to broke you saying yet you can do this

245
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,780
you can't do this or maybe do you have
to work like these but you have

246
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,080
implement play the the

247
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,800
try to to investigate as much as
possible and to do this we have

248
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,160
different waste way it works is sold
that they found a different system

249
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,210
we have back doors but I sit back north
its the the right time so it's not the

250
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:49,780
back through

251
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:55,060
speaking about moderate and so on but we
if different ways to access the data

252
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,560
command line interface most devices are
manageable

253
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,330
yeah web interface to the which were for
sure coming to face

254
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:06,710
so why not try to automate some process
get the someone like to see there is no

255
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,080
even come and give is no more or most
Creek people

256
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,410
automatic feature that weekend reeves
most devices also provide with the PI

257
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:19,970
using the zone symmetric risley you can
connect to the device you can fetch some

258
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,190
interesting that that you can't create
object seem to love them

259
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,580
the system that the basis the device

260
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,770
are wrecking was that a bit because I
have to store the data so that the base

261
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,060
is presenting the system

262
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,580
so one looks like to accident likely to
reuse

263
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:40,090
the the real value fee or of the
Information Store the

264
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:44,760
scripting languages there are plenty of
languages for free that you can use to

265
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,510
with the maid think I we show you an
example of expect for

266
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,770
it's quite very poor for you can see it
sixty Shin

267
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,400
than that session you can do ever seen
you want so at the meeting all the stuff

268
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,170
and 10 from Tiger I'm co-counsel or
device also half

269
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,770
or Whitehall console you can maybe try
to

270
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:07,390
automate using some more for me other
liberal you next to try to send comments

271
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:07,850
and

272
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,670
extract the ok I tried to the tough get
different kind of protocols

273
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,560
so we have the tools but you can also
use the TPS TFTP

274
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,830
SSH S&P a ice map

275
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,030
I some suspicious the protocol which her
I thing as

276
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:27,570
east mainly use by Infoblox devices
where you can earn

277
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,900
what type of device are connected on
unit 3 a

278
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,050
for example when the device connects on
on your lawn

279
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,620
you can send I smoke messages and you
would see you would see

280
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,610
these these ice us the psychiatrists its
the device

281
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,210
use owned by better and is even better

282
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,300
East member of the accounting you play
some on base whilst

283
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,780
on this information you can apply some
kind of policy

284
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,040
before NC Peter from accounting as on
the excess

285
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,210
on was the vice of goof website and saw

286
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:04,670
all you are also a lot of proprietary
tools like the BDP checkpoint

287
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:09,090
declined nice I or but I hate degree
because it's like playing

288
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:13,430
it works only on Windows systems but
with plenty of nice to

289
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,860
go thoughts like DVD I would ever get to
come online and you can

290
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,689
in chick objects create eat other rules
yup commonly

291
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:25,189
you can script all the stuff

292
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:29,030
so automation is the key I first for
sure I am

293
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,920
and I'm pitches like you ought to really
see people sorry trick in the book to

294
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,830
make stuff

295
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,240
if we can stop the script for blog to do
all the job

296
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,410
one that's one of what might this tour
to automate so stuffy

297
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:44,320
expect is expected to spend their own
put them on iTunes but with plenty of

298
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,150
more useful

299
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,590
bull by Dorman although commonly which
is

300
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,640
and you simulates a session so basically

301
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,060
it's all lot/land like the quite
Allscripts for BBS

302
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,730
you send a string you expect announce
for and basil hill so you can take

303
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,430
decisions and automate

304
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:05,470
all the stuff so this is a real a simple
example so I something I'm

305
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,320
creating a new the

306
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,970
a new session I stark SSA session using
my user on this coast

307
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,489
I'm expecting don't think if

308
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:19,999
I don't have a final but I'm receiving
basra I we just sent

309
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:23,989
my password and so on and so on so I we
just simulates

310
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:27,580
a user fee if you're and you can write
for every very

311
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,659
experts who can for example I script to
take backups siskel see each issue

312
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:34,909
I kept the to very or devices the truth

313
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:38,489
than that the you can also see me dates

314
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:43,710
a East the session so it's quite
forceful so basil

315
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,289
all those in formation I I can propose
you and you are key to cure for the

316
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:51,859
York you know your secret devices so we
keep

317
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:54,960
the same gave you so all the devices

318
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,619
the device of the case in January you
actions and

319
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:02,649
basil's action picture it looks nothing
bring you we've seen half

320
00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:07,149
see which on the all the looks but based
on the scene

321
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:11,690
before the sea may decoration rules made
detect suspicious activity

322
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,749
and sent information into a tool box

323
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:18,149
and these two books least within six the
to into

324
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:22,539
the different components or for more
from unsuspecting bypass

325
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:26,330
the scheme and action a species action
with the

326
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,330
automatically to use it to the books and
inject the tying to order the rights

327
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:35,169
that's black you to do that I would like
to see more and more 3d

328
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:38,480
increase the reactivity to go to 326
okay

329
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,909
I haven't even maybe it would generate a
another

330
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:46,149
got only be for rebbe scenery be a

331
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:49,759
100 by a secret and that he's but at the
same time

332
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:56,220
I week the connection and broke already
the APS two books

333
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,669
a trick in the you can use so once again
I would just defuse some

334
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:03,989
examples and some waste to make more

335
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:07,179
are activity between two devices that
once again I'm

336
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:11,659
I don't have some goats to say I don't
have a report ready to download

337
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:15,379
the to make and it just

338
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:19,549
some beak I first one

339
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:23,669
using HTTPS we can access this this
example come from

340
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:27,609
a I want to fight wars if I'm right so
you can

341
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:31,730
directories a fry will using its yes the
first step would be to generate

342
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,139
and the TAT so you send any should be
regressed

343
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:38,230
you can be very useful to get the did
you get

344
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:42,320
you received your key and then US a very
very big ATI

345
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,409
a available when you can create change

346
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:48,769
the confusion as you want this is a nice
example DC's

347
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:51,960
nice a very short example with when you
can create

348
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,559
simply a new host in the the database so
you sent your critique

349
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,919
its coffee you have your key action

350
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,690
sick you defy in fact all the work with
the russians based on leaks some

351
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,889
insights we defined the passing the XML

352
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:10,220
you create your name although on which
firewall you with hacked

353
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,869
in which the cease and you create a new
host that's the name

354
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:17,429
get get this would be 192 168 01

355
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:21,359
you can put a description you send these
sheep eucharist

356
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:24,999
and you live and you get treated the pic
into that these the next

357
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:28,990
step in the treating the rules creating
commits and your film

358
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,609
you can send create the subject the new
o3b yet secure

359
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:36,580
you we send the next will be drop any
traffic

360
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,580
from or this I can dress you commit

361
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,220
and in a few seconds of I will be able
to book order to see

362
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:48,369
eccentric another example

363
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:51,779
s a snort source not is a well-known

364
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:58,119
a I yes but down with the all the
security tools which except snowfalls

365
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:01,519
so why not generate on the fly specific
rules

366
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,559
and send them yeah another for the kurds
yes it could be the final

367
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,909
STP also a on the TTP put

368
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:14,029
with to CP creates through the room disc
in this example is based on

369
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:18,129
both go because US plenty of me to do so
you can use the snow

370
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:23,349
room with you you create a new one it's
another DCP for any protocol

371
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:27,570
from the sake address and you can also
put nice

372
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:31,649
information and most important East the
so the snow through it.

373
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:36,789
in these on this you put this new ruler
in or you're different to be two devices

374
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:39,889
and they would be able to detect
suspicious activity

375
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:43,730
coming from than than the 10 on the
example

376
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,899
of devices accepting a personal force

377
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:51,659
is a firearm I run the system you just
inject your own rules and you can

378
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:55,080
is that the block of the pic more money
should security

379
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,649
ice map

380
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:03,580
so this is the for the court to describe
the few minutes ago

381
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,869
on it's an open summed up mainly use on
the phone book systems

382
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:11,359
an um using a fuck you can riche

383
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,720
nice the formation or you can search for
information

384
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,730
in the

385
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,270
some kind of course about the base you
can so for IP addresses

386
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,530
looking location a domain so

387
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:27,160
location can be a or a thirsting

388
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,120
you read BB to locate which devices
connected on which

389
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,230
6 poll for example and a

390
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,390
base on this you can also use well

391
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,680
and you can generate nice request so we
should we stop

392
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,120
a nice my positions and we say okay we
def gotta unlike address

393
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,280
psychiatrists its this Mike address this
Mike address and dislike that the the

394
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:50,920
device

395
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,650
belongs to John and zombie don'ts into
group on Fri

396
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,679
and based on this weekend again generate

397
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,809
rules under its and thick actions if we
see

398
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:06,809
a specific you coming from John S&P

399
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:12,140
S&P Swindon oh nice monitoring protocol
but we can also post corporation

400
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,290
to make change devices a in the example
below the S&P

401
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,700
still use mmm instead of a classic isn't
get

402
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,870
begin issue in the sink sick an this

403
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:28,110
comments means that will be sent ICM be
a recover

404
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,880
62 the psychiatrist using this S&P
committee

405
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,890
deceased the y de Beaune to did
belonging to the device

406
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:40,740
with a specific AP and a fine in fact
this is an example for Cisco device

407
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,370
will when we with Bush US Cynthia TFTP

408
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:48,900
home this router so in 193 if we
generate automatically

409
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,160
and the skill on the TFTP server we send

410
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,750
and S&P said to this router between

411
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,920
get the FTP load LCL a flight and we can

412
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,960
once again broke device broke and I can
dress and

413
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,730
19 one one common again for the Cisco
devices

414
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:12,220
the CL a more this is good devices

415
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,280
use a framework call EM which

416
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,950
means and the even manager sorry its
this exactly what I'm trying to

417
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:23,610
describe today but only for Cisco so you
can define specific

418
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,700
evens in the Sysco corporation and

419
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,860
those even sweet be able to treat your
to see a script

420
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,910
again he said script you can upload them

421
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:36,350
in the flash memory of the device you
can use it yet 50

422
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,450
and this example see that's if

423
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,030
in my sis look better and I get picked
and a dawn so

424
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:47,540
a a fluffy interface for faucet the Nazi
will slash one for example

425
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,730
tasty too so it's a plus we're
expression I just

426
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:55,429
might even be steel I commend execute
this

427
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:59,890
script its it is TCS kicked in this case
it's a notification

428
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:04,420
but you can also isn't what you want and
generates nice

429
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,179
a actions broke user and

430
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:12,150
do very nice configuration a

431
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:16,340
the CAD sorry for falsely means that the
Tcl script

432
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,360
running on the Cisco device will be able
to compete with external devices

433
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,700
the for example the arm its

434
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,750
down 10 you my way and known

435
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,470
to be running onto with you I see this
yet sleek income did you can stop this

436
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,750
the session you can generate traffic
from this is good advice to the outside

437
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,150
those examples

438
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:41,820
you need at the specific moment you need
to speak on you need to tune

439
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,179
to correlate all the stuff in to be able
to

440
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:48,870
to take actions a make in

441
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,000
in this case I'm using with six I really
a fan of this

442
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,270
still which is a lot management solution
so open source

443
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:59,710
but the thais very very the

444
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:04,290
Google important a features first it's
called active response script

445
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,720
and the other things I I'll active
response pics

446
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,520
is very easy to understand in case of
specific

447
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,290
under you contribute to Scribd it's a
script so you stop

448
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:19,220
everything you want and you can again
take actions about sex creeks

449
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,460
a did you work with just on the cohesive
a four eight-six East

450
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,950
for example a Brooke and I to broken IP
address for user name

451
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:31,120
if you detect the Brit Russell Stover if
I see an exit night

452
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,370
on SEC ice is a safe exit night on
server a

453
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:38,490
then server the thats oversee in 30
seconds to 1 minute

454
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,700
you broke yet congress toys 6

455
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,980
ice-t's very configurable and based on
this weekend

456
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,450
receive order even Jim refile by the

457
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,620
the devices and trigger all the script
to in fact

458
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,410
iPhone action reaction that's a cool all
the system

459
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:59,220
every time you see something suspicious
reaction will be

460
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,690
do something broke drop sent another
arkansan

461
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,760
and is this is an example of always sick
rules

462
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,050
this is the rule number one 100 101

463
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:13,290
live in Fife if I see five times

464
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,750
in sixty Seconds annexes the night so
this is the the type of %uh nothing but

465
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,320
a group

466
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,090
what they do a block user for location
look at this is my true active response

467
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,120
so if I see

468
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,360
five thanks the same exit night all
specs

469
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,470
night on the deeper servers I can
extract from the other to the user name

470
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:38,120
and I can book user read principal
action reaction like with no

471
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,760
in this game some examples no

472
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,020
so real example a single disclaimer

473
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:51,850
I already get some names a boat's
offender all sides spoke about

474
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:56,070
a for growth by 12 cheekbone I have to
eat

475
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,900
names because most of them already you
see you in for stricter but I

476
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,010
don't I hate working we spend those so

477
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:07,160
I North nicky was them and the word I
just given

478
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,910
the name it is even for a ice example
first you can use

479
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:15,000
online resources a well-known a

480
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,540
list of suspicions the main aims East's
a

481
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,760
my web domains the film way you can

482
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,150
ya trumped-up you can don't look at
regular interval you can do not have

483
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:25,970
become size

484
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,110
this that's this is a plane tix fight
off many shoes the makes

485
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:32,510
he took the tits I think the of every
two or three days

486
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:36,410
an you can also implement receive
grossing

487
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,580
again we saw a little a few likes of
pearl

488
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,210
you can see if this domain ice-t_ if we
become

489
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:47,140
if its missiles on the according to
Google it works

490
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,530
quite well an a so if

491
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:53,540
from your proxy you extract useful

492
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,990
your head as you can bus them to several
seeing to

493
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,870
good civil see guy or you can match your
amazing 65

494
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:04,020
so you can store in the database the
domains and you can process

495
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,210
in replying the differently so we gots

496
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,410
a new layer so you a change really
confusion between

497
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,740
the the solution

498
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,410
the maybe the the exam that that works
pretty well because we

499
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:22,950
the sign my company so I also made

500
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,410
Singh confrontation focus some rain we
may go to a live demo

501
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:30,590
its based on different components so you
have to fight I'm I want my way on these

502
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,050
books

503
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:35,350
which is a project which inspect your St
you listen to be traffic in real time

504
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,960
and strike depicts interesting stuff

505
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,270
base tomorrow so the UC got to overcome
a command control center the you see

506
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,470
some ice is the main

507
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:47,800
and this the story several to generate
alerts

508
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,940
when dick something special we hope we
have

509
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,200
little different fire on with this
checkpoint pilot to

510
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,940
I T bills inset whatever you want here
and

511
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,790
with sick and integration of all the
product

512
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:05,060
wi-fi why hi hi system

513
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,660
and that a single life all the traffic
the text a

514
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,880
a model where generate and use in 2006
sending the formation

515
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,810
was sick extract I could just the
command center it rejects

516
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:20,360
life in the checkpoint by 2020 and be
diversity a

517
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,030
address the glue of this of course

518
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:27,590
fire ice expensive delights so

519
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:31,140
maybe we have you have a lot of money
organizations but

520
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,290
Hoffman you have only one appliance the
to deploy

521
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:38,920
where US the most popular traffic so the
go the call cicis

522
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,960
all a very the the making to Texas pints

523
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,160
using the solution we'd be able to push

524
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,140
the bad IP addresses warner remote sites
so if you if

525
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,900
of Isis in bristles iris City

526
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,900
New York ruled on you can stand the
traffic at one point

527
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,370
you can check and see by doing the site
that is 43 many shoes

528
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,990
so we broke it immediately misuse
accounting all the firewall

529
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:10,190
you can use in dynamic user click least

530
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:13,560
it's the same but for users so we have

531
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:18,230
assist local self-referral useful with
six we can also use this as you can

532
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,610
to depict but but you'll serve you

533
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:24,710
an we assume that the user of stalking

534
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:29,400
is yet be there at the real slash an
Active Directory and the goalies almost

535
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:29,970
the same

536
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:33,920
we receive information yet 16 on from
the keeper server

537
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,679
see oxygen I for use a John you so a

538
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,730
on the some its process by with six and
always sick

539
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:46,390
based phone scripts can also block take
changing using Active Directory

540
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:50,500
like me that the user is kick off
immediately but for the user

541
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,169
but US time to investigate and you know
that at least

542
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:58,310
the the user is temporarily blocked and
will not be able to

543
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:03,310
more mmm even money suspected

544
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,780
another example SMTP a mother and that
is this

545
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:10,230
um its another project I'm working on

546
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,450
the mmm based on postfix the

547
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:18,530
was known MTA who which she said
unopened full smile when I see system

548
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,190
and who it makes which is my month per
script

549
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,780
in fact only 3x the old S&P

550
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:30,240
defeats received by post 06 well 63 your
script

551
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,530
which a Equinix a

552
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:38,250
so it sends or that the top WiMAX remix
extract or the mine thanks

553
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,669
so holding torsten if fis you it has

554
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:46,640
eggs if I Z Fidesz send them to coo coo
for each time and he's

555
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,919
so using the system I for or email is

556
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,450
coming on my domains automatically eased
out suspicious

557
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:57,480
what's specific types of ice I will scan
them

558
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,600
and once again like it I we you able to

559
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,310
actions if something suspicious the
static

560
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,540
mice chris says defense I'll mmm

561
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:13,389
I had that the slights this to the
evening because the thats the something

562
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:14,200
brand new

563
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,190
and it was also mentioned by Ike's on
their doings presentation

564
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:22,679
um the way use in this case TPU

565
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,220
makes my skin my screensaver talk to a
fire or something else

566
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:30,700
broke of NC users by default MySQL

567
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,770
ice no way and I'll

568
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:37,120
to look the did the one the old

569
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,220
a rules-based home muddy shoes SQL
statement

570
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:45,010
so if you make 34 in your email grady

571
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:48,879
no money it could be sent back the
client and get petition

572
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,240
miss take the action in this matisse
user missed miss

573
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,090
do something about the errol with my
skin with not

574
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:59,170
lookit you can enable the

575
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:02,700
for looking on my stress like me that
the three lock on the flip side

576
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,970
or decrease but discovery beats my
squeeze every week it's

577
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:10,010
so simply because he couldn't cry a lot
of I you'll see

578
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:14,090
you so it's not weevil on a production
environment

579
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:17,180
so my idea was to use my script proxy
its

580
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,280
my scrapbooks the goal of the store
eastgroup balancing across multiple my

581
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,010
scripts over

582
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:26,080
its easy that Sun but the nineties'
what's

583
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,370
even more fun my square proxy can

584
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,650
use a do a script like and math

585
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:36,200
and you can't inspect its good Greece
and you can rewrite them

586
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,540
on the site before sending them to the
Reitz ever and finally my scrilla

587
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,490
another nice feature called you the F
its user-defined function

588
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:47,490
when Bay storm than retirees you can

589
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,530
at more features my skin and 10

590
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:54,460
one of the Utes that they use this one
which simply allow you to store

591
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:59,080
something in the oxide so used to select
a role ok blah blah blah

592
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,890
the a blistering will be look on and all
ok of the my script

593
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:07,170
so if we put all the different things
together with

594
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:11,190
this kind of infrastructure we have a
client sending information to the

595
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,380
myspace proxy

596
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,859
the mice break my spirit. proxy change
the

597
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:19,600
on the flight the crew so it at show on
the and a few

598
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,109
a environment variables sent to my skin
is the moon

599
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:26,770
in case of payrolls the arrow store York

600
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,290
disorder got free to do whatever you
want the posse one that I C

601
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:34,370
again we scored six or sequence and
extract the IP address

602
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:37,630
get the address to be pushed to the
firewall and once again

603
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:42,000
week know that chip

604
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,980
very important slight about the controls
um

605
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,740
when you implement this kind of solution
so you try to make as much as possible

606
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,390
you infrastructure

607
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:55,820
first think about security because we
are trying to improve the security

608
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:59,460
by doing this but we can also introduce
more

609
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,280
security issue that's why some controls
must be implemented

610
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,730
why because if we ago automatic system

611
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,839
she's done weekly the configuration we
can be tripled from time to time

612
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:15,020
that's like for SUNY through implement
very good with a petition

613
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:19,600
and authorization the example that they
gave about the

614
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,770
where the guy for I'd like to of course
you need to put

615
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:26,089
axis least 250 200 ni the server

616
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:29,810
written the script are all the final
defying a strong looking for us or

617
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:33,880
and all this kind of stuff of course

618
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,140
unique record changes so based on the

619
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,180
sons you change your configuration with
you

620
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:44,240
change must generate new evens which
would be used to generate the report

621
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,050
every day

622
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,710
so for example every day when you come I
eight in the morning

623
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:53,160
at the office you will receive a report
from C this has been changed tonight

624
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,730
because we we detect its the suspicious
a good race we broke

625
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:00,470
issues or drama so unique keep the
control

626
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,660
%uh

627
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:05,510
very important slide because II thought
to our managers

628
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:10,220
previously speak I present to the Saints
like the more realistic to

629
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,430
risk complaints and so on this kind of
tools

630
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:16,800
can break the compliance phrase and PCI
DSS

631
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,990
we you need to have a strong point ralph
who

632
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:23,170
what when and why if you let system

633
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:27,280
change or prosecution dynamically maybe
between break some

634
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,150
golden rules a husk by he said yes its
complaints

635
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:36,920
use on alt spent network if you are
under the night also is the setback

636
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,190
only shoot right to change dynamically
the confusion of

637
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:44,600
or all of the device if you met Ricky
three overruled by Therese

638
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,980
baby would be the bird trucks SUV's like
so useful to spend that works

639
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,480
and finally you also introduce risk of
the night services

640
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,560
uuuu weeknight so this yourself for
example if you take

641
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,620
that your roots user account these use

642
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:04,100
rejected several times and you broke
automatically the root account

643
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,319
all unease with the unease with Rachael

644
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,160
always you broke your in this server for
example you would be in big trouble

645
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:16,320
so don't kill yourself so

646
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,850
conclusions um for me when you buy
secret to protect it's very important to

647
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:21,510
note to

648
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:25,660
not by books I hate books they yes read
books

649
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,900
US ghetto ones blue ones I don't get you
buy a solution

650
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,830
so read sex money while try to extract

651
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:36,040
as much a scene from a simple Sieber
from your device is compact you've

652
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,660
endorsed

653
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:40,620
offense trainings the reach around three

654
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,870
documentation because once again you buy
to predict

655
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:47,300
and you must you able to use it I the
for

656
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:51,880
or other products and find any suppl you
so I just gave some

657
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,190
I East I just get some peace but I will
never write

658
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,500
to keep written author of the book for
everybody so

659
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,080
investigate maybe we give you some
heidi's the

660
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,850
I hope so but investigate take sometimes
and

661
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:10,100
try to to to make your device

662
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:15,009
working together a more efficiently ice

663
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:18,990
you if a question I think so in question

664
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:21,250
idk
