1
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,559
to wrap up today so there should be a
talk about

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,169
itis one book about but caution

3
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:14,539
dossey made on eyes summit today

4
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:18,499
cryptographic function provisions the
competition and i did not win

5
00:00:18,499 --> 00:00:20,450
so when not talk about

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,599
my function

7
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:25,710
i was the commercials regional uh...
about do i dream that when the

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,009
commission

9
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:28,880
and i would finish the day

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,160
excuse even if someone for husbands

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,840
story out you know the function dot one
is called

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,220
kate ni cc eight day

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,919
if you could do its name

14
00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:43,370
if you couldn't get suck you will find

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,540
the host function

16
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,250
if you go get sucked ki

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,970
c eight j

18
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,010
with foreign use which is a

19
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,449
but in these tents

20
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,810
and the picture behind you sir

21
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,760
example detect and stuff so it's not an
accident

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,220
uh... the guy that doesn't get second
i'd issue too

23
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,020
to avoid a conversion

24
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,160
democrat indonesia and on the from body
dot belgians

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,270
i'd have nothing to do with uh...
dissents

26
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,460
but that just sort of the the name
sounds

27
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,259
i asked them personally

28
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:20,470
first go back to two dozen and five th
which is the derision office for

29
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,730
duration of the shots the competition

30
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,640
wide

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,180
do we have a shastri now into doesn't
twelve

32
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,230
atlas mostly because um...

33
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,840
the professor go

34
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,510
uh...

35
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,480
tortoise to papers of published over
published

36
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,250
collisions twenty four twenty five

37
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,980
gruza four-to-one

38
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,579
seizures

39
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:44,170
the message is uh... informal other blog
off uh... person either

40
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,480
kiki blog dot and if it is broken and
that he blog

41
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,590
uh... showing is broken

42
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,880
there's a big difference here and again

43
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,300
probably guess what is

44
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,579
the big difference between this
throwbacks

45
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:00,840
would you like to use in the five today

46
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,200
did do you hear someone

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,069
the difference is that the attacks on mt
five opportu goldman's dot

48
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:11,259
in the paper a big h two examples of
messages

49
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:14,209
studies of actual collision

50
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:17,049
beneath them and that that he could
refund if it works

51
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:19,789
indicator showing is just surety co

52
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:23,059
it's mean that they reduce the
complexity of finding the collision

53
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,819
symptoms of um...

54
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,409
compass this very

55
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:29,369
show on his one hundred and sixty beats
a flashing

56
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:31,899
which means that's required
approximately

57
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:33,650
to to dat or persons

58
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,609
definetly collision due to the book the
paradox

59
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:38,849
who did the eighties uh...

60
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:40,909
impractical forrest

61
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:43,499
omitted practical for dennis aorta guys

62
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:47,529
but what the farm is in the fact that
reduces its capacity to about

63
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:50,079
because it's the seven

64
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,819
that prettier

65
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:55,169
by any means that the attack is becoming
more practical

66
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:57,899
even though no seven years that there
was to the heart of the potential wants

67
00:02:57,899 --> 00:02:58,779
to go hav

68
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,129
and integration

69
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:02,639
that's where if you go to remit the
banking webpage

70
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,419
the certificates to sign which i want

71
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,399
and the reason why we hav just freeze

72
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:12,029
but that is a doesn't help much
imagination

73
00:03:12,029 --> 00:03:15,659
because i'm so on and then a device that
to and to look for seminar intro one

74
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,779
also looks like candy five

75
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:20,879
so they were concerned that the attack
on and the five

76
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,189
uh... that was extended to taiwan

77
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:27,019
would when they become practical and so
on and that it would be even kitty

78
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,430
lead to a texan shot too

79
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,430
charter which was published in two
thousand and two

80
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,079
officer uh... from your for functions

81
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,900
but this is that the basic design

82
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,699
so of course we were panicked

83
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:41,549
uh... an essay panicked in these that's
in addition of a decision of the u_s_

84
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:43,529
was panicking and prepare for a for not

85
00:03:43,529 --> 00:03:45,059
panicking because

86
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:48,650
it meant a lot of folk for them it
minced few papers people because shins

87
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,129
throughout the quite quick happy with
this but situation

88
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:53,609
it doesn't seven

89
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,560
niece publishing their fidelity stir

90
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,709
sources give children a lot better

91
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:59,179
u_s_ government

92
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:00,239
buckle fall

93
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,639
uh... submissions to shastri

94
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,619
which such shame is not post like forty
eight is a good time goes on

95
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:09,489
the new york a resumption street would
be selected

96
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:12,129
i'd say but the competition

97
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:13,869
anyone could summit

98
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:16,060
um... designer

99
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,040
and ben

100
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,709
miss would think that the best one

101
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,369
was the one of the deemed the best
interest

102
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:22,690
so what where do

103
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,520
and the criteria what further
requirements in terms of

104
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,849
of interior

105
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,220
what it was not

106
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,870
the like out why the mixture from the
olive

107
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,050
requirement documents which are very
strict with respect that

108
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,939
arthur minority

109
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:40,550
this was not like this it's plus much
more wagner said for example

110
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,050
what did you have to put some with
argument in a revised

111
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,310
fits wyatt earp too

112
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,229
which is optional answer to

113
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:50,979
so in other words it would be chefs who
does not

114
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:54,139
is not intended to replace jetblue

115
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:55,199
augmented

116
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,520
whatever means

117
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,449
to help shocked to hear

118
00:04:58,449 --> 00:04:59,810
shastri were not

119
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,930
replace it

120
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,110
between

121
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,710
be something different but a bit better

122
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,620
goodman to stand out

123
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,930
now in terms of

124
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,740
security a performance of the secured a
strange should be

125
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,530
axes as good

126
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,590
i set up shop too

127
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,679
so how do you measure security office
offsite fair for cryptographic algorithm

128
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:21,389
what you got your partners in the metric
to stay

129
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:24,550
this uh... ha security office

130
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,179
forty-two or in picture can be it

131
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:28,539
doesn't know how to do it

132
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,499
we're just to say you're a sticky

133
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:33,849
based on the number of fronts attacked
by crib than others

134
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:38,270
and republica ko security margin for
example in a yes

135
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,009
and that was not backing

136
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:42,010
which was published on six rounds

137
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,229
out of ten

138
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:47,259
so we got a secured a margin of and
minus six quote for round

139
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:50,389
i think he returned to the problem of
what is in the start

140
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,289
already something that you can implement
it is something that is

141
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:56,229
bitter don what to expect ideally

142
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:58,479
it's extremely unclear

143
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,569
and those bodies

144
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,319
district he should be achieved with

145
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,539
significantly improved efficiency

146
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:10,710
it's a bit better to get easier to be
fine causes us

147
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,020
uh... measure disputed

148
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,719
and you see how close it is

149
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:17,610
but you have served by mentions in terms
of a chintzy

150
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,819
uh... what but from

151
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:21,539
is the sixty four-bit there and uh...
cebu

152
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:24,789
is that there are certain to be tom rath
how process or

153
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:28,449
use it in the abt the are houston aids
emaciated g r

154
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:29,889
the fiji

155
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,609
area is that the amount of memory that
you were implement it would cost him in

156
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:37,379
a mikham microcontroller

157
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:41,419
us a quick nines due to be fine

158
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:45,639
he later in november two dozen night
there six sixty for submissions

159
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,050
uh... on the fifty one where what they
called

160
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,660
competent broker

161
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,549
within that circuit where

162
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:53,479
not soon

163
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,579
not completing the says that the
specification what's not

164
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:58,389
what's not treatable

165
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:02,179
uh... what sandy gross hard uh... did
commit this a meter forgot to send this

166
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:04,430
victorville or

167
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,409
second look up to par

168
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:09,449
and it doesn't nine dissected fourteen
of of them

169
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,639
in the second round of the competition

170
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,119
finda fifty one dorm in the uh... many
weeks a mission smily not so serious

171
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,369
emissions

172
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,249
many of them were broken many were
obviously

173
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:21,000
slow or too big

174
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,949
so we

175
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:25,400
and adequate fourteen reasonable hutch
functions

176
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,279
and in president is on

177
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,500
ordering in fall two thousand then

178
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,539
five arrive intervene if i know

179
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:34,099
uh... but year

180
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:35,470
it's not because

181
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,149
ghetto were broken

182
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:42,719
but just because they were again moving
more secure all foster

183
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:45,119
so there's a mission st from

184
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:48,729
this uh... away it's not an exhaustive a
petition but you see that we have guys

185
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:49,910
from industry

186
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,319
mental sony microsoft certified bien

187
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,749
academia defense was then

188
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:58,319
uh... season this rather than in austria
in france

189
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,470
also government institutions

190
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:05,259
uh... it's in the end u_s_ uh... we have
a soda people from the french and see

191
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:09,309
of there we weren't spectrum of uh... of
summiteers

192
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:10,439
um...

193
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,509
the dennis

194
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:14,459
the most interview

195
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:19,979
we put others guys in the room and we
tried to beat them the adolph each other

196
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,359
and at the end mystic wants

197
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:25,679
to reduce its uh... very nice to have
the funniest because it's

198
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,610
just free war career

199
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,520
demonized is this image of fame

200
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,450
bread the designs of the others imp
among them

201
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,860
and that the en route

202
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,680
it did the one that as the best

203
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,800
assist will cost millions of dollars

204
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,110
because supply mostly paid by catania

205
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:48,170
which means bade bhaiya why buy you a
pic spirits

206
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,230
after so that when design recording my
p_h_d_ a

207
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,420
not be far from him

208
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,310
here in nyc thoughtfully

209
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,830
and i was supported by uh... the
national swiss uh...

210
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,329
for different for science

211
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:03,980
which is your money source was

212
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,070
feckless about

213
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,490
they walk during this four-year square
about security of ocean

214
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,370
and performance of our mission

215
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,319
and maybe one success of shastri

216
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,550
if not the winner

217
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,430
is all the what has been done

218
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,270
industry side security improvements of
arson

219
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,690
as an example of uh... developed the the
reconstruction that's been broken

220
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,570
red me is that you have an actual
collision

221
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,970
arrangements but the attack is not
brought to go but

222
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,960
it's gone the verge of uh...

223
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,420
a forty ca criticality

224
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,790
so i will extended zero image

225
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,520
now does get it

226
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,330
but there just to say that that we we
disco person gave rise to extremely

227
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,610
sophisticated

228
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,800
and maybe over sophisticated

229
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,230
because techniques

230
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,910
this is a pretty river very options
singers like uh...

231
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,410
in fortunes to separate the offer option
is for

232
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,720
finding collision inverting the function

233
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,770
we're timothy notions of what we could
distinguish ur

234
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,980
which in distinguishing the function

235
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,000
from around the martel which is an an
abstract must much contract which is

236
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,650
free perfect

237
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,950
and

238
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,340
you we were in this bubble of research
in

239
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,570
mother that sometimes doesn't make sense
but

240
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,640
c it's good for such a good began what
they perceive a longer cv

241
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,489
uh...

242
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:20,910
well you know the game

243
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,980
things like this be kick it thats

244
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,410
services department rickety yes

245
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,520
may be sure

246
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,910
read the news so two years ago

247
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,050
uh... the set up a guest is broken

248
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,570
so racism

249
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,240
broken for academy x but not

250
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,840
not but in reality

251
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,200
they got a paper of the critical frens

252
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,920
maybe more interesting is the
performance of our mission

253
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,950
lots of extra nickel picked on people
walked on this

254
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,170
uh... for example

255
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,370
thirty ths the hardware

256
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,530
rebutted the age

257
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,830
walkway regimen in the u_s_

258
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,670
heard remiss in university

259
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,880
differ bigoted

260
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,990
a electrocute what implemented

261
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,520
the firefighters

262
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,040
to look at pictures for each financed

263
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,940
uh... they did is project glaze now

264
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,950
it's uh... framework for automatic
basting off expedient the magician

265
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,810
you gave for each function

266
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,890
a number of p_h_d_ in implementation

267
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,070
on a number fifty two devices

268
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,760
it with this difference in these options

269
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,800
and between automatically repo the best

270
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,340
performance figures

271
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,410
to give you a conferencia vera
performance overview of affix function

272
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,150
but even better in software

273
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,020
approve the you know uh... don bursting

274
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,290
which is the at our few madhe begin ass
off of things uh... that's a very

275
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,560
good crippling security work

276
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,080
did this thing called subra crop

277
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,130
even cris villanueva it's been before

278
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,600
it's about software performance abortion
apostle shins

279
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,830
it's a framework that comics

280
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,530
c_e_o_ assembly implementations of
hostile chins

281
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,370
the focus of the candidates just read

282
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,750
he collected all the and promotions
available

283
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,940
edwin cancer meeting implementation

284
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,540
forty smashing

285
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,320
on which you're in this program

286
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,640
the problem with this or the complaint
of such a column for example b_c_c_i_ to

287
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,060
see uh... visual c

288
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,660
with a bunch of different competition
options so my nestle streamline a summit

289
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,040
reporter all about

290
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,780
all these different combinations

291
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,790
and at the end of the data recorder
single foster's combination

292
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,280
and the goal is three heartburn

293
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,490
meaningful

294
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,360
uh... but you love this is hot flushes
much my function

295
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,040
so of course it's sa spot of the best of
the misled you hav

296
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,150
but it's maybe

297
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,650
close to do the best that we can do

298
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:50,200
gives you an overview this is a man six
for becca picture

299
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,300
sanded bridge

300
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,540
uh...

301
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,700
not the most recent ain't the
architecture my pocket picture but the

302
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,750
previous one

303
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,430
where you have uh... david subscriptions
analyst fictions

304
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,649
you see that the first visit

305
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:04,230
is um... blake five twelve

306
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,450
which was the submission blake

307
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,100
with five permanent rugged notebooks

308
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,210
scaned the submission of personally
rawness ferguson and

309
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,880
his friends is a bit

310
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,390
so it is this is a book skated by the
way

311
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:20,020
and here we have shut to charter that
section five twelve

312
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,660
to have this kind of graphs

313
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,510
this is as in the abrasions to p u

314
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,850
uh... previous generations of think then
to you see we are at harvard

315
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,880
the conferences you off

316
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,860
the performance of each function on each
but from

317
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,100
and to the single best of them addition

318
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,630
we could go on that is uh... indicate
then

319
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,810
uh... andy

320
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,900
but that there were two percent the

00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,430
desktop picture

322
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,410
but got to get sandy's

mo by democrats picture

324
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,920
in which isn't bad

325
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,290
uh... you've inhofe power pc's

326
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,830
uh... by personal stuff and then

327
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,380
scorpio misc welcome snub returned cheap

328
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,000
at harvard's open in ah... some version

but form to another

335
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,010
uh... here's must do

336
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,760
due to find that that was a blunt the
cryptogram

337
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,630
you hop on the certitude bits

338

producers of students instructions

339
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:21,970
uh...

340
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,850
in describe it

341
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,540
it's a citizen to be armor

hello you two sixty for beat them

344
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,460
fictions

345
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,870
so i went to the details but

346
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,800
you get the idea

347
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,200
and this is for michael controllers

akhmed cheaper

349
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,540
it seems uh...

350
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,450
uh... was this one

351
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,400
hello diversity of but forms

352
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,920
and this was not done for the its
competition mrs

353
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,470
unifil shastri and it's not or process
free this can be used for um...

354
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,850

fgets active young them in

378
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,410
and these memories about the ritz

379
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:08,060
maybe because he was so so the main
design of of yes

380
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,570
it's not fair but someone's twice

381
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,400
uh...

382
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,330
isola being swiss miss what would be an
advantage with them

383
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,969
so very few rim but it does

384
00:16:17,969 --> 00:16:20,350
sites before

385
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,229
we had that

386
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:24,890
break-ins gain were considerably faster
than ship to

387
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,580
grasp it sucked up

388
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,060
is here

389
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,800
canceled twice a slow

390
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,790
twice lowered and chocolate twelve

391
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,820
good may seem a bit surprising white a
function so went up to one

392
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,109
when ricardo

393
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:40,030
foster functions

394
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,130
i'll just be not that simple

395
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,370
so why did it

396
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,230
it sucks and then the press release to
explain

397
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,790
the show the court elegant design

398
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,400
large security margin

399
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,380
uh... which is true but which is true
for all their five finest

400
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,220
grew general performance uh...

401
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,160
and it's inefficient in hardware

402
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,960
edited these extremely fast exton
effects have been in hardware the

403
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,700
remains uh... a second or fiji

404
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,459
and first flexibility

405
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,760
which is a bit different emotion

406
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,699
but this is an essentially means that
the difficult to implement it in uh...

407
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,589
maha braveheart different picture
different results

408
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,079
between space in time

409
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:27,650
and another resented eight compliments
because concerto for me

410
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,110
in other words that it's extreme
different from japan

411
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,140
and doubts

412
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,820
that makes sense because if you look at
bacon scan which are much fuss and shot

413
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,370
too

414
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,440
natsumi not just to show through

415
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,710
but they hav more similarities and get
cycles

416
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,470
curbing similar to show through doesn't
mean that it will be broken by the same

417
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,100
it back

418
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,830
but

419
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:55,390
a nominee newsstands working with and
they say they beat out there isn't

420
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,649
indeed they say that and i thought it
could will catch up to most likey

421
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:01,090
would not welcome kit shock

422
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,600
because if you are designed to different
people

423
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,429
osteen dust are perplexed oil for
candidates

424
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:14,330
and it's it's it's interest rates but i
think the most river documents the

425
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,050
accomplishment

426
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:21,960
and so here how could suck walks i've
actually implemented cheppu role on d

427
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,549
five or so on

428
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:26,220
you know it's uh...

429
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,500
itself function but it's not a single
algorithm

430
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,700
it's called for the fickle person
function

431
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,970
that dates blocks off message

432
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:38,330
blocks of five hundred and twelve
baseball show one for example

433
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,870
things assistant food that thanks

434
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,460
but into north st

435
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,070
and that mother boosted by use to rome

436
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,370
to a new internal state another what it
takes a big dat da

437
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,420
and it's compresses it to a smaller
amount of it dot so its political person

438
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,720
function

439
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,260
and indicate that this check we don't
have such a coke some folks and we have

440
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,590
the used a

441
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,140
from addition

442
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,940
which means that i function that is in
vertical

443
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,730
you can go from the the stock at the end
in the other way around

444
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,480
thirty sounds a bit surprising because
we're talking about how functions we are

445
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,669
which also known us one way function

446
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:12,580
andy from the folks who could be
inverted

447
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,059
stuff when white

448
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,990
here at the fact that the

449
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,650
if there are some function is not went
away

450
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,000
does not imply the duke would function
is not when we

451
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,620
todd's talk to stop from any nation
state

452
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,300
zip two zero

453
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,159
forget sockets one thousand six hundred
bits

454
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,570
you may compare this to the state of
shock left work which is

455
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,310
alphabets

456
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:39,090
so here is your message

457
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,660
but because it uh...

458
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,290
but in message but it may be

459
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,390
i mean train zeros

460
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,930
so you speak to miss ocean blocks

461
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:50,140
and u x or the first book to bill
internal state

462
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,960
you applied to permit dish and you end
up with a new state of the same size

463
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,540
you work so the subsequent message buck

464
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,429
and so on and so forth

465
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:02,190
and when you call fix old all of the
message blocks to the state

466
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,240
and interdict this with provisions

467
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,830
then he went to a diplomat squeezing
phase

468
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,660
goes to support function

469
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,470
uh... which was in bed and by the same
guys

470
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,390
to watch will absorb on the message

471
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,260
you're under sperm addition

472
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,539
again and you extract

473
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:20,630
cheng self

474
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,110
internal state

475
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:26,910
seen other water it never leaves the
court stated but just a small part of it

476
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,030
and what the crew of mother matic
mathematically is that

477
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,020
if you are given do small chance of
plate

478
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,030
if this function is good

479
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:39,289
then you cannot inverted

480
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:42,400
passing that's a pretty good idea
because it's a trim simple

481
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,169
you just have this employment

482
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:49,770
and as it's reasonable to say that it's
important because fictional function

483
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,950
okay for his father these days of the

484
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,160
of the function

485
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,890
so this is what is inside a

486
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,390
at some of the risk gary hart who's on
the street kids are so i don't know what

487
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,799
you yuan here's the syntax with uh...

488
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,179
it though

489
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,150
the kia

490
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:11,410
uh... i want to spend what it does but
just to give you an idea

491
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,769
advil something porto folded in on

492
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:14,880
goodies

493
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,350
uh... at random

494
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,640
doubts dark wood reasons way to do it is
operation since matric inspirations

495
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,980
uh...

496
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,900
and if you have to implement this uh...

497
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,870
i don't see stuff from these specs but
is the equivalent of his ambition

498
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,780
which is much

499
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,140
which is easier

500
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,760
uh... people off

501
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,230
byte arrays

502
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,380
c_d_a_ bien you just direct source

504
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,100
profession

505
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,530
and that's it so

506
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,299
if you know a bit about because this

507
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:52,100
you know that if you wanted to exhorted
server by news because it's

508
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,340
completed you know

509
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,020
if you want to do it source

510
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,399
or you can essentially inverter function

511
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,860
you can guess audited days without

512
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,900
knowing when the portion is doing

513
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,630
but if you look carefully there's not on
the exhaust

514
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,780
what does the revision but it's just
uh...

515
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,570
moving the way also around

516
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,800
there is this not an end

517
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,440
logical

518
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,950
so this observateur minority

519
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,870
you're the function describing their own
function

520
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,620
doesn't hav degree one ba degree
commitments it's another brick function

521
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:27,290
and he repeated several times today
algebra decree will grow exponentially

522
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:31,210
in other words in terms of deposits it
will be secure

523
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,790
in other water resistant to different
show or not but i was this

524
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,740
weed out this and

525
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,470
to implement its and you

526
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,520
mistaken the made anexo hence it often
and

527
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,860
it becomes too thirteen secure

528
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,490
be careful when you write accord

529
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,250
and off put enough right discord because
the function would be extremely slow

530
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,540
uh... you should do this instead

531
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,530
uh... did help give up complex
techniques to optimize implementations

532
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,799
too if you don't want to do it by
yourself

533
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:03,490
uh... you can go to this uh...

534
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,350
to another address where you can

535
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:09,659
get uh... the sequel bsn dakota

536
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:12,240
yeah the one hand it's simple to
describe

537
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,419
one of the simple

538
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:16,740
but he took off to the minute
efficiently it becomes much much much

539
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,590
ricky

540
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:24,930
it's is weird but if you care about
speed

541
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,220
so this is how fast

542
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,840
get sucked is on uh... example

543
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,020

545
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,010
uh... personally javier vixen fictions

546
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,770
uh... running out costa figure hats

547

perfect six and five for the persians

549
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:46,900

00:23:56,429 --> 00:24:00,000
on the other hand at five twelve big
rush into depression is

556
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,160
considerably slower

557
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:08,210
and uh... so listen my function which is
faster

558
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,570
not close enough for him

tejas sina comparision issues from
investing in d

560
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,240
this the f_e_c_

561
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,230
it went pretty

of the simple birds into this uh...
smoke detectors

565
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,640
foster and the small took to bid because
chuck is

566
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,940
sort of the big catherine

567
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,289

568
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:32,660
slow and defect interestingly

569
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:37,169
but his because of features of dan but
lucky picture

570
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:39,270
way you'll youhave

571
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,909
more efficient what revisions

572
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:43,049
due to the excerpt the instructions at

sandy

574
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,110
and again the process when these
mclaughlin

575
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:51,940
right now if you go to another paper for
but from alma

576
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,029
is this number of an issue of welcome

577
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:55,870
so it's a very nice uh...

578
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,990
uh... arm-in-arm bathe to summon chip

579
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:02,539
here show through his very fast

580
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:04,390
even faster than than blake

581
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,370
one of the resents is them

582
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,130
the numerous sumption

583
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,820
offset to which uses

584
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,200
uh... s montana state

585
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,860
and this means

586
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,950
to make a long story short if you were

587
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,289
load installed versions

588
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:21,110
which just goes on but they couldn't do
it

589
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,580
and he said at that

590
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,730
well you know we don't want to use the
the begin to be cat socks if you're

591
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,850
sugar busted

592
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:32,220
i did i'm not so that you really care
about speed on their own smartphones

593
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,320
uh... and maybe i guess it in the future
system on ships

594
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:41,799
you will have uh... hot rods are adults
for shastri chess trees that are used

595
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,440
now if you look at uh...

596
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,970
the very low-end sneha maybe our men

597
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,270
microcontroller

598
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,030
so here you hav to dock space

599
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,529
the frequent

600
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:54,289
so

601
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:55,970
how your image faster

602
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,570
kitamura sumption and you have different

603
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:03,380
implementation to each dot is an
implementation

604
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,899
the red line here is uh... they two five
six

605
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,740
uh... we have a version here dot
grandsons skewered on

606
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,060
for kid abides

607
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,600
uh... andy's a reasonably fast

608
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,610
course that is uh... that with becky or

609
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,070
now do

610
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:25,070
smaller version interesting these uh...
kits etc

611
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,520
though about

612
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,150
doesn't go bck akito bites but the
coverage

613
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:35,550
and it's yet about four times the lord
and and and make but

614
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,779
off to the couple this kind of figure
because

615
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:39,169
you want to ask yourself

616
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:41,179
what speed do you need in the navy are

617
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:41,990
uh... will you

618
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,289
are shown

619
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:46,510
did you get by five so nine your
microcontroller

620
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:49,300
uh... i don't think so so maybe
understand but foam the most important

621
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,480
this memory consumption enough enough
speed

622
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,110
is uh... meets

623
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,100
at the end it's uh... chip

624
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,500
uh... kid it different to present so

625
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,060
i think it such as the fastest but

626
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,559
blake is uh...

627
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,500
airbus smallness

628
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,420
stats out but is it that foster

629
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,260
and you know the speed

630
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,429
said the bites

631
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:13,450
one

632
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:17,710
advice by doesn't cycle for not about
the uniqueness

633
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,399
competitions

634
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:23,679
there's a couple undisputed circuits are
does fairly well in terms of uh...

635
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,870
speeder

636
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:27,510
and is extremely small

637
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,720
so interesting ticket psyches uh...

638
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,330
is very good in the land

639
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:35,600
not so good and the high end to be use
booked

640
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,650
in masa petitions shot to resides fast
enough

641
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,530
unless you are and then up because you
are you worried there must be doing in

642
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,510
the high speed but don't forget to your
limited by the

643
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,990
by their harddrive writer writes peter

644
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,700
even though it's as these have

645
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,330
speed like when former in fifty
megabytes per second

646
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,380
uh...

647
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,140
it's to the word under

648
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,750
underweight speedo for most businesses
these

649
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,540
them

650
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,000
melanin hardware

651
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,710
so meadow compass figure security you
have the area

652
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:11,630
so smaller is better inhibiting the
speed of

653
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,510
so india the direction

654
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,230
so dot

655
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,559
the more you are the lead to the better
it is

656
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,179
it's that detective extremely grid here

657
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:21,659
one of the smallest

658
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:25,110
pick up different architecture burgundy
from the heart of pictures

659
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,870
it's one of the smallest

660
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,680
shut the ways of its more

661
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,830
but gets actress much fosston shot too

662
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:34,789
if you took of the unit it's uh...

663
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:38,000
more than fifteen gigabit spur sickened

664
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,040
on the spot from which is a uh... you
and look at you into technology on uh...

665
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,210
what have been made eighteen odometers

666
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:45,940
uh...

667
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,570
west get sacked helps out

668
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:51,270
the uh... more than five uh... you give
us per second

669
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,039
began to question is do you need is
extremely high speed

670
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:55,700
uh... does l from

671
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:01,370
competitions uh... issue where you need
is has become a complete you of uh...

672
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:05,280
uh... i don't know appliances for doing
uh... secret you might touring in uni

673
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,090
too harsh ordered a binary that goes for
the network

674
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,410
you would permit their about speak to
you

675
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,909
but again this is on

676
00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:14,519
long messages

677
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,539
if u hav short messages youhave them
multiple overhead the few hashemi

678
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:21,890
eight-by-ten six invites

679
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:26,850
what hubbies performance unless you do
appropriate by playing and projection

680
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,039
on exp j dsa be different

681
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,539
it features a different b is done in a
sick

682
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:34,810
i did the trick which is uh... there

683
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,159
uh... the higher the better

684
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,430
hysteria

685
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,920
opposite the photograph

686
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,669
uh...

687
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:43,250
here we see that

688
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,870
one of the smallest

689
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,929
assumption is that

690
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:47,760
the scheme

691
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,360
j h baking

692
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,809
and get sucked

693
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:53,880
nxp g_a_ speaker and mic

694
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,720
and begun cheppu

695
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,840
quest range

696
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,799
and if you could this report dispute it

697
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,940
it's actually still unzip p_g_a_

698
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,270
and blake is uh...

699
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,529
the fastest

700
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:06,899
it's you cannot say

701
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,940
what this book that is the best in
hardware

702
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,580
because would have very different
poppers and

703
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,820
uh... in a sickening man in the fiji

704
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,160
uh...

705
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,680
so

706
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,770
a seductive seca squirting hardware

707
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,799
but mostly

708
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:25,340
must in ninety six

709
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,930
you know did you get a separate

710
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,840
powered by the way by security of uh...
fits uk

711
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,929
today it they were very clever 'cause
they're deport cryptographic prizes

712
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:38,210
which means that uh... okay um...

713
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,440
missing two months

714
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,350
we will give a crate of bed jen
therapies beers

715
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:46,230
the best uh... your thoughts of the best
of that and i don't get stuck

716
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,880
and with my if randy molly one then

717
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,870
a crate of on purpose beers

718
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,240
including the vest that that one which
is very

719
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,480
difficult to get

720
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,070
but they repeated this sort of pants
with an italian coffee machine one of

721
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,539
the adults with autism thallium

722
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:03,660
i think that's handed in

723
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,630
about rebut bigots three or four perfect
prizes

724
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,240
ice an incentive to it by the function

725
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,279
and

726
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,659
article prison

727
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:14,460
the function what's not

728
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,649
oc dot in the sense dot

729
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:18,200
that your security guys

730
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,000
uh... singh dot dot dot ms mean an
actress right

731
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,019
they were just academic it but some
ridge's person

732
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:27,559
uh... for example

733
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,860
and uh... their own function of get
psyches

734
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,019
twenty-four arms

735
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:35,190
initially outdated arounds

736
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:39,050
and big trees it from eighteen to twenty
four

737
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:44,600
because they want to put the decrease
yet but wanted and you know

738
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,490
this was maybe more barton publicity
down now for security

739
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,679
so an example of

740
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,559
i think that you can sin research papers
is

741
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,399
these an airliner about that

742
00:31:55,399 --> 00:31:56,840
i don't know what it means

743
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,779
but they have an eighth round
distinguished sure on

744
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:04,640
with due to the forty four hundred
ninety-one alone

745
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,029
uh... if you're idea

746
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:11,469
cindy amount of uh... electrodes on
earth is uh... b go to to the one

747
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:12,539
hundred

748
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,430
uh...

749
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,259
the eighty s keys one hundred and twenty
eight beats

750
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:20,960
so which means that the deployment
twenty eight two two at that

751
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,669
you can essentially reduce s impossible

752
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:26,660
but do you get the petition because
dismember

753
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:31,140
is smaller than five twelve

754
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,150
uh...

755
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,270
some attacks

756
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,080
walk

757
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,789
that they will come in pc

758
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:38,050
a single pc within a few minutes

759
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,360
collisions

760
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,070
something meaningful in stand-up get
socked

761
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,800
registration of tickets uk

762
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,760
ways forearms

763
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,830
are tough

764
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,980
torn risperdal security margin uh...

765
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,380
so that we have like

766
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,059
twenty runs through to break tourist
data from version

767
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,820
and neither one is a

768
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,130
my favorite one

769
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:04,270
uh...

770
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:08,760
it's a zero sum distinguish aris
something come pretty stupid

771
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,539
needs absorption nothing

772
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:14,710
anticancer but sing about this technique
because i invented it

773
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,910
um...

774
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,120
it essentially means that you find

775
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,390
a number of imports

776
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,170
that these two eggs are all of them

777
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,889
you get busier strain

778
00:33:23,889 --> 00:33:27,549
and for all of his inputs you get or d
respective outputs

779
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:28,430
you eggs are

780
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:32,680
the order which'll together and you get
zero as well

781
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,720
it doesn't look as i can affect at all

782
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,490
but ditional spoken and i didn't
function

783
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:42,360
uh... and yet issue published disturbed
rather protective sack

784
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,880
aka hitech

785
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,700
and had accomplished the east

786
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,470
to to do fifteen hundred seventy nine

787
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,910
but it's not but because of ideally it
would be fifteen hundred ninety

788
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:56,720
and it's two things guys i hope you got
the heart of the british in the

789
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,980
conference liquid

790
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,169
trouble to remote basu

791
00:34:00,169 --> 00:34:05,420
wasn't that paper

792
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,889
one real advantage of except that you
can do this

793
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:10,439
hi h

794
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:12,719
a function

795
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,919
and message

796
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:16,679
you caution turkey followed by thomas h

797
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,509
and you get something

798
00:34:18,509 --> 00:34:23,489
and this is equivalent which mark this
is uh... thirty dosh function

799
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:27,669
which is u_s_ forex mark for message of
competition courts

800
00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:29,939
but that's not secured check to

801
00:34:29,939 --> 00:34:31,259
because it's up to

802
00:34:31,259 --> 00:34:33,349
if you get this value

803
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:38,269
then you can create divide you off
birthday and one in followed by end too

804
00:34:38,269 --> 00:34:40,179
we don't know in case

805
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:44,589
endorsed under this was shot to but
which a freakin you can do it

806
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:49,259
and that's a nice property is uh... that
if you were out and uh... not the komodo

807
00:34:49,259 --> 00:34:50,549
where

808
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:53,829
the four states again need to get
bursary

809
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:57,519
they're not expand before it's not quite
a ways you can inverted so if you don't

810
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:58,010
do it

811
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,429
for internal state

812
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:01,119
you can go bach walks

813
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,799
according to state

814
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:08,129
and initial status in cedar essentially
dekhi

815
00:35:08,129 --> 00:35:10,769
i'm not sure about model but annoyed

816
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:15,709
summer petitions where it's risky

817
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:19,439
should we care should you care about us
reach for developing a product

818
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:21,749
uh... should you implement shastri

819
00:35:21,749 --> 00:35:23,909

833
00:36:02,409 --> 00:36:05,969
and weapon to the fat sac is you can use
it for different applications then

834
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:07,139
hashing

835
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:08,979
you can use it for encrypting

836
00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:13,219
fault missus and that was indicate
authenticated code like i said before

837
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:15,959
and authenticated encryption

838
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:21,439
uh... it's not s ten dollar it will not
be standardized by missed

839
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:23,429
advantages that euro

840
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:25,990
shaping your software you disapprove the
mint

841
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,209
this function

842
00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:28,400
and you get for free

843
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,570
mukherjee cipher

844
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:33,239
cannot function of course

845
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:36,869
does that do you have the rip ladies

your slicks truck

848
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:44,430
at the same time that you would submit
that to the state

849

00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,479
because there are some property

854
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:16,009
applies individually to the function f

855
00:37:16,009 --> 00:37:19,369
but not to do hodge function as a rule

856
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:22,340
and anyway cost this crazy complexity
dot

857

pontiac

861
00:37:31,259 --> 00:37:35,349
you would we just read your faster on
and assist them your frost on six

862
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:39,279
forbids your usual to implement and

863
00:37:39,279 --> 00:37:41,330
when we did not win but some of them
clinic

864
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:44,750
a colleague of mine tell me a now but
there could be digs induction which of

865
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,019
of crystal

866
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:47,099
person

867
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,459
e other issue mostly from us reset

868
00:37:49,459 --> 00:37:50,640
uh... sugest

she did not win she was sick and off
serb

872
00:37:57,459 --> 00:38:00,059
but she was much more successful than
the winner

873
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:02,459
siyad some other advantages

874
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:04,659
besides that

875
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:06,649
and

876
00:38:06,649 --> 00:38:07,519
the hot tub

877
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:08,579
lake uh...

878
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:11,150
well who may not be our success flags
and yeah

879
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:14,639
but we are working hard to retrieve
group blakey

880
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:15,629
and

881
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:18,069
but it was or do you know that in the
quark

882
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:20,560
and unfortunately at that in the eyes

883
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,769
often

884
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:23,650
is connected to the read or needs

885
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:26,099
who we are now walking with a bunch of
people

886
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:30,949
developing sings like large storage
products developing ordinal competitions

887
00:38:30,949 --> 00:38:34,789
and telling us what they want former
from for affliction

888
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:37,159
what is will repeat what different in
here

889
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,829
and what

890
00:38:38,829 --> 00:38:41,779
what kind of cryptographic function they
would like to see

891
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:44,519
for use those for developers for
implementers

892
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:47,950
uh... because intimate us don't care
about your son distinguish truth on care

893
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,359
by security proof

894
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,759
victor by the time it takes to implement
it

895
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:55,189
so they would be a date too

896
00:38:55,189 --> 00:38:58,289
bullets coming soon and i can only tell
you dot

897
00:38:58,289 --> 00:39:01,889
uh... this would be good for customers
integrity check for

898
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:06,579
did a petition of petitions maybe
fighter ideas so i'm not sure

899
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:08,289
for p two p

900
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:10,669
