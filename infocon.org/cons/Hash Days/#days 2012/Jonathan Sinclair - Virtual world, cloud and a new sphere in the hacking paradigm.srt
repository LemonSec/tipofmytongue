1
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:08,469
so if i cant its I'm so

2
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:11,830
thanks week on a steak up

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,410
so K this is great with this room right
because the other one you can come and

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,580
go from the back and

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,810
not include speakers in DC feel quite
bad actually think and I get to see who

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:20,220
you are

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,760
so I can ask that a white I her

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,940
sorry I had to talk about hypervisors
virtual machines

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,100
arm its it's gonna be comin over you

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,149
I about the attacks that have previously
existed that currently exist

11
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:38,340
and Mike on research where I'm going
with it

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,730
and what I like to do in the future in
this regard I'm on con going under the

13
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,670
hammer axe

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,700
this is being in play for a year and a
half which means

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,140
look for you play one funny thing so far
on it I've gone and other hand those but

16
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,440
for various reasons like James

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,579
on my background is so systems
programming system packing

18
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,649
I could think I have some not experience
about

19
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:03,250
how long 14 is going to open source
community about tried anything done

20
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,469
in differences Committee regarding
operating system design Foshan sign so I

21
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:08,950
kind of went and did my own thing

22
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,530
for quite a while and now its kind ever
its intense come back at the scene and

23
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,640
get some stuff out there so

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,510
I'm not a mess with describe the
storyline so it's gonna go through

25
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,170
backgrounds I'm very very quick profit
rise I send

26
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,130
hypervisors I'm short on his pretty much
media with what they are where they come

27
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:28,520
from

28
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,100
if not and get a quick one side to side
stocks about that arm

29
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,750
in preparing for our section doing
things on going

30
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,799
I have to try and have a focal point
because the whole hypervisor world

31
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,270
is exploding the moment with different
vendors and so I did some

32
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,670
reasoning about why I'm scarred looking
at and i'm looking at I am

33
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,729
what the federal tax base is on offer on
what's coming available this is a sure

34
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,869
few short by saying what has been
creating the possum way right now

35
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,689
I also don't want to present some very
hopefully

36
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:07,020
for equity right on going my own
research in this field so

37
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,429
Creek issue that some as this will be
quick I

38
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:13,609
two points I am where did this all come
from

39
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:18,230
so a lot of people have got clout thing
on status the buzzwords

40
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,870
and yeah if it's been off since the
nineteen sixties on this stuff is all

41
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,090
I'm it really amazes me that in the
computing industry regressing cycles

42
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,059
are going to start going technology and
tobacco 67 season is over

43
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:33,309
right i mean these guys much rather than
all right now

44
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:36,609
and we just have to come back in the
past made it a lot better work

45
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:41,370
my opinion so um what's also quite cool
I think about this references

46
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,559
you can check out with I'm memo and

47
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:48,730
the memorandum whose four members if it
is intergalactic computer network

48
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,059
i think thats cool right I'm insists
aside the time this is the nineteen

49
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:53,409
sixties everything's cool

50
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:56,849
and yeah they're ready this every this
memorandum released

51
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:01,779
made other concepts for for cloud
computing and so the house client stuff

52
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:05,120
excellent get the 1970s what we have

53
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,989
former requirements for virtualized so
generous not Texas I don't know what

54
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,319
happened that I started smoking
something different or

55
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,819
I you know it sucks when to the serious
face right I mean my hand projects going

56
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:17,010
on things like this I thought

57
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,439
okay some is going to be awesome said
Geis this interactive stuff was going on

58
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,699
so socialization requirement to redefine
at this point on with equivalent

59
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,290
resource control efficiency

60
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,629
I just 90 tonnes if you wanna reader
read it's kinda interesting paper

61
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,719
but mostly guys to using virtualization
stuff now will

62
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:38,739
the familiar with this and that's cool
morton incantation

63
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:42,489
um now not graphics guy as you might

64
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:47,169
see from this wonderful thing case not
Android I some likes of stuff so

65
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:51,609
um but I tried to put some pitches and
coming up in this and other interesting

66
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:55,079
I'm time-line where we've been and where
we're going we wrap

67
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,349
so we can see the VMware was around 1998
and I mean this is on its founded

68
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:03,449
9-9 tie today I was still looking
assembler so I think compu serve

69
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:07,299
and their own stuff and now is quite
amazed when I found out that has been

70
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:08,299
nice nice nice day

71
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:11,819
I'm no still said cutting some good
thing since was already there

72
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,229
so the sea you know insignificant 62 the
nineties okay have some time to work on

73
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,810
stuff

74
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,669
and now it seems a rush to get to grips
with Microsoft finally working out could

75
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:21,349
be interesting

76
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:24,370
and get involved in space so okay just

77
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,150
the idea of where things stand so what
does this mean

78
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,199
I am ok it isn't this my tensions I am

79
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,349
what's this whole college stuff remain
so to the ok ice

80
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:38,599
I who were around in my sixties doing
cool stuff I think it's like okay

81
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:42,389
time check a few things to know before
missing or killer incomes and state

82
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:43,220
going guys

83
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,479
cycles things happened once before with
with her again

84
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,569
young guys in my opinion now if you talk
any the use

85
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:53,610
it's like okay I've got my I finally got
something in my

86
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,580
so I steer it's accessible everywhere
why the hell did you buy guys in the

87
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,000
possible with discs and

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,340
United transferring them to CDs and come
on

89
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,349
on but we don't care you know what know
how that works

90
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:08,590
right it's just got to work so I'm in
this for the hackers

91
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,710
so are free skies here now this little
resistance easy

92
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,719
when the tow truck found stuff in the
hackerspace I am

93
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:19,780
which I have understand actually because

94
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,780
it's an interesting reverse psychology
trick for me its I wanna sell this stuff

95
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,810
to people because I don't wanna keep
learning new stuff

96
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,409
to such a degree right I mean in the
cost nothing some kind of virus playing

97
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:32,159
around with him

98
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:36,030
suffered a concussion things I have
platforms an app to access the key

99
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,629
migrating to changing

100
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,789
what virtualization allows me to do is
if one vendor

101
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:44,129
okay the idea is that if you have one
kinda under the gun attack

102
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:47,289
gonna make my life a lot easier is to
promote technology to

103
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:50,379
to play with this there is lots on

104
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:54,599
and thank you very much how it says
because I can fix outta my okay great

105
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:58,500
I don't have to learn six different
offering systems four different TCP IP

106
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,250
stocks

107
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,789
I've just got one thing I can we go off
to so me this is a

108
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:06,099
great opportunity so you know I got the
management thing guys got a cloud to

109
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,669
cloud it's great it's gone

110
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:10,699
brilliant bigger cost savings and that's
when my life easier

111
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:15,629
I am quite lazy I'm getting older now
I'm not 16 I'm not 18 I haven't got like

112
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:20,300
20 hours in a day to like sick coding up
got girlfriend this type of stuff so

113
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,120
yeah site please make my life a bit
easier right management go to the cloud

114
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,599
let me

115
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:28,520
gonna make my job easier so this is

116
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,060
again and I so graphic I'm not tough
season one for myself stuff

117
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,960
um taken 30 from Ricky and Men tonight
kermit okay

118
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,069
know the reason I structures pyramid is
because I rated in

119
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:42,400
level importance my raising by the way
so

120
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,580
act our clients more interesting for me
at the moment out current wife

121
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,460
ISO for the service talking with service
okay

122
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,189
kinda sitting on this guy instruction
sucks

123
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:57,490
and this is the three interest me from
system programming side because this is

124
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,969
well with you since the flights

125
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:04,319
what I say that well many other levels
some packing the periphery

126
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,300
um socially based cloud services said
your Facebook Twitter accounts

127
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,819
I got things not really that much really
interesting I'm not Kalamata

128
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:17,039
ok at your dog and gonna be somewhere
and i wanna blackmail you in with stock

129
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:17,439
stuff

130
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,210
really not know interesting for me so of
course you can exploit this

131
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,560
you can get because they turn things
like that but yeah not null sorry

132
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,909
not return to enter into the system side

133
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:32,199
from I'm sure you're familiar with the
Mahan hacked

134
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,370
recently on Wired cannot the sky read it
should be

135
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,539
arm but I mean you know it was an
interesting article

136
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:41,710
about you know how and secures clout
stuff is

137
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,969
into from social perspective well come
on the guy had his account daisy chains

138
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:48,300
and haven't even taken aback ups now

139
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,069
the same gonna flirt state about you
know he's asking for it right

140
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:57,059
I'm and know this stuff can be can be
solved within a traditional spirit math

141
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,409
phishing attacks and social engineering
so

142
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:03,860
not retain ago on have

143
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,400
sets of reserve a spot for the service
this could be interesting

144
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,699
so for six service I think this web guys
I mean much to these

145
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:16,990
are accessible via the web so its use
the open sea than normal standards

146
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,199
web application techniques and again I'm
walking to the system

147
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,819
interest side so from some level what
you can do exploring system calls

148
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:28,050
so that's why it's on the vendor looking
infrastructure

149
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,409
plus point your attack vector in the tax
base is much larger

150
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:36,510
okay I mean when I ringside know this
and start going again systems

151
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,659
to be like okay maybe a condom for main
system so I have to go and find some

152
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,680
systems

153
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,040
like a little less secure okay this
expert were cracked the code is your day

154
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,570
I have fun going to a system I can I
have to make sure the lock screen that

155
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,029
what system is this

156
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,850
on then I can try and it's the Nexus
them something network scans and so

157
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,680
yeah so excited now i've a management
console

158
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,110
and oversized infrastructure thanks very
much a break at once

159
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,269
know me I get access to a lot about it
easy stuff I'm goals see the effort

160
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:09,240
a sustained attack Nana and Sri takes
all time and I just must be thought of

161
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,300
okay and said amazing so so that's what
that's a 30% interest me

162
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,870
I am so we should

163
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,029
i was thinkin great this is cool we
going to such a service high school

164
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:21,740
attack that

165
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,290
but yeah now things get more complicated
it's about two to three years ago you

166
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:25,899
could say

167
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:30,480
yeah because VMware tickets and goods
now mike soft seems to involve

168
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,500
wonderful yeah see another 100
marketplace

169
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,310
I and useful things like virtual box and
when you start to look at just

170
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,170
known by metal virtual machines I you
just gotta hope for debt collection

171
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,839
technology so we'd end up in the same

172
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,459
got them for movies with the same
problem a flight OS is

173
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,970
and you can learn of the technologies
which was to attack

174
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,899
so my current to the research I said
okay and that were in the Tahoe trends

175
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,269
IIT got message from make things
complicated okay I'm you know vendors

176
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:03,470
knowing so I had to try and work out
there which friends like attack

177
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,690
rich fantasy critique of is the top dog
so

178
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,240
I and the car VMware for you by surprise
many view here

179
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,050
arm north makes decision it's gonna run
through a couple constraints I put on

180
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,139
myself

181
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:19,070
I as its infrastructure as a Service I I
wanted to the concert band metal

182
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:23,040
primarily VMware office by Madeline on
the missile systems this means

183
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,529
I'm sure many you familiar with us a
metal number middle terms

184
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,320
yeah okay this that my sister done Wikia
whatever

185
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,649
um basically I wanna go off the bat a
metal stuff

186
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:37,490
simply because yet again it at of the
best breakout see

187
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,839
option options to for full
infrastructure comprise

188
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,029
so I want to find a candidate offered
both it's not like

189
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:49,779
your first of which you can get with it
doesn't matter in between

190
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:53,110
IRS and your VM by to various

191
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,630
a critique of them out directly to go to
one their confirmation

192
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,070
in December code levels so

193
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,730
so I said I'm so this mothers also
because an orgasm usher

194
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,430
okay what we've got in about to rise a
sincere and hypervisors

195
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,930
is the stuff somewhat SMS gratis 98 but
VMware ESX restart thinking seriously

196
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,649
about security may be the last

197
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:17,279
year maybe if you're lucky Zen slightly
better

198
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,399
arm but is still great for us I mean we
can

199
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,570
I mean that the opportunities
transportation just waiting for us

200
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,130
to serve get back and what's amazing to
me is we have only got into

201
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,540
hypervisor hackers out there I'm a lot
of the stuff that's coming out

202
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,610
from so the scene at the moment is one
guy who's been given a bit over

203
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,070
time to do some things I'm deny myself
you know it's not ready

204
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:42,459
supported by industry they find a couple
exports here and I have one hypervisors

205
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:45,500
houses there's a break out somewhere but
it's not really

206
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,130
given the way I think it deserves but
that's that's that's changing hands

207
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,440
it is a mature so we saw how chances to
get quick wins

208
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,610
and yeah make things easy

209
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,750
so who's a biggest market where the
sausage biscuit Frank

210
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,019
com and i know i mentioned governor and
soccer

211
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:05,029
it's quite embarrassing I'm sorry but
yet it

212
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:07,569
you know the %uh the two groups and a
group and you have the emerets the

213
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:09,649
biggest and it looks like they're gonna
be the biggest for

214
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:13,660
foreseeable future any sexier two years
okay so it makes it for

215
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,029
a good environment to go full sewing and

216
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:20,100
one side by the constraints PMI comes
out on top its

217
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,410
it's the vendor that I want to attack
arm

218
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,690
yet of his bare metal a number medal
this License and was really nice is the

219
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,579
people project

220
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:31,699
so the book initiative is are

221
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:34,819
set a club racing between EMC VMware
which

222
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:38,329
in CRN's and Cisco to really come
together and provide better

223
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:42,279
switches but you've got a ways the whole
kit and caboodle so for me this is music

224
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,649
to my ears on my head thank you very
much

225
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:48,310
now it's like super everything but
suffice and this is like my job much

226
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,790
easier

227
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,279
so super so what were you thinking about
with some

228
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,850
VMware and testing them you want some go
against the system's

229
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,670
so previously as I said we had to in the
old days and so the Titans

230
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,329
stuff you could either do good
reconnaissance and find a high-tech

231
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:06,279
system and see if you got something is
your day

232
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:09,380
of class some exploit this in a while ap
psych was on fire

233
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,839
and go for it that way but it's often a
lot of work

234
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,180
arm and some physical layer but with the
virtualization stuff now

235
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,759
it's clearing up and got like this
action there the mentality so

236
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,920
you still have to penetrate so gonna
keep up a box in the beginning

237
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,399
but you I need to get I'm privileged
access

238
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:29,899
that's the difference the moment if you
can get a test access on on the

239
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:31,120
commission

240
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,290
then as a loss that he can do without so
forget about trying to get through

241
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,380
that that doesn't necessarily have to be
the case on so I just wanna

242
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,029
again into some graphics air this I
won't be familiar with right it's just a

243
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:44,490
standard

244
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,579
backtrack on testing testing cycle so I
just went and I'm

245
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:51,029
it stay with us like the ones you have
fiscal air not about size Asian they're

246
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:51,819
on top

247
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:55,920
you have two more of the same stuff but
the important thing is that you can do

248
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,850
some guest

249
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,500
okay this is quite a critical good thing
depending on which rich I'm

250
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,190
attacker teachers but but only to cool
stuff in different guest

251
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,889
so you got a number for perspectives
about when you look into the system

252
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,920
one to go to SARS my and you got one can
I access the system you got the you know

253
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,360
work on some stuff

254
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,399
even work out whether the bus missing
exists or not I get to how you doin

255
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,420
second

256
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,190
and the second part is okay you have
access to the system this could be

257
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,269
because releasing

258
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:28,120
releasing about a machine access from a
vendor in easy to perform from Amazon

259
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,149
for example

260
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:33,680
after XO consultancy so sensitive way in
like that the guest access on something

261
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,149
I'm see the Senco anti-dole access Micah

262
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:41,980
Suncoast methods no personal time assign
want to highlight ports

263
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,240
this rats interesting if you kind of the
virtualization

264
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,310
443 90 to 93 a thousand good place in
stock

265
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:52,060
a thousand is that the motion networking
p.m. which is the network

266
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,079
which to laos virtual machines to
transfer

267
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:58,230
between a on about the motion here sorry
before

268
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:02,649
yeah yeah okay so when you're making on
a show so

269
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:07,379
an exciting morning so feedback is
always a travel and conferences are

270
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:10,279
so it says progress now they want to see
a what the hell was he talking about on

271
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,500
the bouncer

272
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,819
I think I need to know but I am yes oh

273
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:17,980
a thousand so the motion stuff is
actually the one thing I i'm I'm quite

274
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,899
interested in

275
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:22,069
because the way around pressure machines
migrating costas

276
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:25,310
and eventually maybe ten network's
depending on how ministries configure

277
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,259
this stuff

278
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:31,449
so wait to see if not thousands 93-92 so
much from poor stuff and 443 is national

279
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:32,410
console itself

280
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,949
for VMware I'm and not is or if they
would that do something up sconce

281
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:40,079
it's got some protected at Yoga your
it's no problem

282
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,850
showdown so dont excellent resource for
getting old

283
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,100
outdated stuff SAR out too rough patch
management

284
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,730
in a bit later but with the amp at the
moment arm

285
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,110
the it's like a quite fast so for is
quite healthy

286
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:58,089
today but we showed and get lot a good
all systems which have been updated so

287
00:15:58,089 --> 00:15:59,759
it looks like three screens

288
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,360
where all the experts also Morris were
work on them

289
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,060
so that's always good for a test-best if
you wanna go after some I'm stuff from

290
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,449
just have a fight and be back in court
on his lawyers office of this is an

291
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:12,069
exhaustive list like this one

292
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:15,189
and do some key things if you're going
to start in the steel about what you

293
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:18,079
should be looking for

294
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,589
so hypervisor invocation now this is
being in presentations on hypervisors

295
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:24,259
for a long time now

296
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:28,629
on and i think is really interesting
because around about 2006

297
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:32,709
with looper which ok around will second
arm

298
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:35,750
it came about that you know people were
able to identify Theron the matrix a not

299
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,910
so than hypervisor

300
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:40,170
and a lot of people are saying yeah this
is really bad and you know the same

301
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,209
happen

302
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,220
and then every once in a when yeah but
you can do it

303
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,100
and that just stop no one really hmm

304
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,579
when further that no one said I could
hang on that's real dangerous you know

305
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,810
if you use it to happen is in a
hypervisor

306
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,829
that has a whole different objective a
whole different route to play out so

307
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:57,839
thankfully no one said anything this

308
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,480
build I mean to such a point to Om this
guy NES

309
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,689
I coated of an application for Windows
just a test

310
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:08,209
the same test whether about Russian on
but your PC in VMware mister functions

311
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:11,230
perfectly out a box no problem so

312
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,070
arm the next call these so for this for
a while you had

313
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,290
but what's which never quite grew access
but then what the hell's he said that

314
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,910
because I wanna get free access for
career success why do I care about

315
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,480
casino

316
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,580
law I mean for me it's its status
monitoring guessed right so

317
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:31,150
then I am but came out is a nice tool a
face in the polls on instruction set up

318
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,170
the PC

319
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,710
over that you're seeing how the
translation happens and those pretty

320
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,730
good reliable results sometime between a
VM or not

321
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,680
on their other code Uttoxeter on which
encode in the summer

322
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,100
really easy to do got the kind of thing
that knock it off compiled a

323
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,150
its yeah know from today max X

324
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,580
I have no clue not test marks that
doesn't cover that I

325
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,350
staying max I'm PC I stayed on my laptop

326
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,400
and I'm not gonna bother testing I'm not
seek its its

327
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,700
its own excitement Nathan so an address
and I'll occupied IMAX thing

328
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,280
for you can talk afterwards and we can
discuss this further

329
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,590
um not the same thing about control or
anything right but many

330
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,950
and my free thoughts anyway I'm so so I
don't know if this works but these are

331
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,830
summer stuff and that's it we should be
fine I was really nice

332
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:22,030
miss him way back towards home I don't
know about them but what or how it works

333
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,800
and this is it would be really get upset
if they're going to be right now return

334
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,860
Sisk

335
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,060
okay so then went back to is a back to
our channel that VMware uses for its

336
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,580
VMware Tools

337
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,610
predominantly and for drivers

338
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:39,130
and are virtualized drivers to
communicate on this is completely open

339
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,290
okay completely and with this you can

340
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:46,250
you can cut up and summer program sent
come on such is

341
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,530
RI I'm so you're 18 CCX okay

342
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,080
and get love useful tasty VM information
about

343
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,500
herkst I'm hot bikes how this stuff
everything

344
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,770
some other stuff is the current some but
not but this time because I have gotten

345
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,710
found out you know are you on that night
featured is promising to address you got

346
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,780
its information

347
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,220
the great thing is it's not look down at
all you can do

348
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,370
the VM administrators can be some con
tightening thoughts

349
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,330
the main point is open and there's no
indication but in the end it they're

350
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,440
gonna close to

351
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,070
so it for these masses what they felt
more we still have this

352
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,830
which the vendor supporting and says yes
it's ok it's open sir

353
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,040
defines makes my house to find out how
much how the space us got the final

354
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,060
version is using anything so you got
guest access

355
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,310
it so I can for your so beautiful

356
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,660
arm past present say they also I just
wanna quickly run through some stuff

357
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,740
that's out there

358
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,130
you may or may not be familiar with I
think it's useful to know

359
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,890
where the field has being where it's
going on

360
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,970
Bluto who had a good girl so

361
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,890
yeah nice picture rootkit I am

362
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,810
yeah and then by she could improve don't
have much a rock star in the virtual

363
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:56,590
world especially

364
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,220
secure sites such a runoff from his with
things laps arm

365
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,950
so she could yeah the blue tho rootkit
which was first reported actor for

366
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:05,860
everything

367
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,340
this is that a black eye a few years
back its

368
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,170
yeah I its this is in contrast about it
about whether can detect

369
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,290
not I contented myself elements of its

370
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:20,570
as a prof concept and nothing was
detected on into some missing

371
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:24,150
meant to this type of stuff um so I
don't know

372
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,460
other people than me maybe argue the
point i think is really cool

373
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,650
and it's really cool so for later in my
conversation what I'm doing

374
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:36,040
what I ok to do with with veterans

375
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,450
I am yet out this is Justin in Australia
this a

376
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,490
I industry and nice icon to climb
breakouts solar

377
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:47,370
basically the guys Goodison this than
unfortunate that the materials got it

378
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:47,770
from

379
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:51,180
more on I'm a security in the US like in
contact with them

380
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,450
so content on it here its but some it
into context to work

381
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,450
because it wasn't publicized course than
and referendum passed it

382
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,600
so it makes two exits now um stuff to
work out exactly how they

383
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,150
they manage to get some contel on an
out-of-bounds

384
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:10,410
freed memory exploitation so I'm not
sure I'm trying to tease information

385
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,350
about

386
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,760
moments it's proving tricky we just saw
kit done I mean okay 2006 or going back

387
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,500
six years is kinda

388
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,410
some time ago and I T okay but just that
was the beginning more last some cool

389
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,920
stuff coming out

390
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,210
2009 again black hats a

391
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:30,040
I'm cross the presented this the
expectation the

392
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,760
manipulated 3d support on the ESXi

393
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,020
fire basically writing stated throughout
a bounce

394
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,100
less and then just come from there

395
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,140
I'm from the guest host so this is a
really cool I mean what he presented

396
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,950
it is a good over the presentation well
worth checking out but of course

397
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,570
is for community and then a package that
with the campus

398
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,270
and see I don't have gone for campus if
I some econ

399
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,420
so this is a bit of a pain so I really
want to do them both and how this really

400
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,390
works

401
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:02,490
so those really great guy kilter who

402
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,720
racy of two of the bathroom lighting out
none of them by vendor

403
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,090
side right time version I have the
source code please give me permission to

404
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:12,150
and once a look at it and he's reopen
guy you can have a look at it how it

405
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,070
works

406
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,320
and he demonstrated using the same on
ability I

407
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,690
NXT 3 house to actually three
virtualized VMware breakout

408
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:24,310
where as a guest and a guest account on
an application and I can

409
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:28,420
then there anything from the host so in
the example he gives the run ciao

410
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,860
body XD but of course you can just text
wouldn't I system

411
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,700
from guest no effort at all I mean it's
just bring

412
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,060
so that was cool but again this is I was
2007

413
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,860
I'm so it coming Creek up to speed now
arm

414
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,430
Metasploit everyone familiar with the
foster from work here

415
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:51,420
not Yes No okay so just in case not for
use mass flight as I'm so much to do

416
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,310
there is now past the mall to which you
can download I think it may be fun with

417
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:58,160
an explosion or a special about us
flights last time I checked it wasn't

418
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,460
on this is developed by Claudio I really
great guy but he took a lotta stuff out

419
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,330
in the wilds

420
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:07,190
on recognized in Metasploit many really
easy for us guys

421
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:10,510
not to worry about I'm Dioscorea or host
the the

422
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,300
give me this pm so how can this was just
brilliant this is facing taking all the

423
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:14,820
hard

424
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,710
work away from us so we have in there is
more to such as them I guess the BMI

425
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,700
session writer

426
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,360
I haven't tried this and he said
eucalyptus modules for VM once

427
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,390
works for versions 3 the issue

428
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:32,320
we're having this that's VMware those
updates so version 5

429
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,300
VMware guest either option doesn't work
I thoughts

430
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,370
him and I hope we can work on version
0.5 and maybe

431
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:45,270
look at make improvements on that human
contact and we had to get that out so

432
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,640
so that's useful because if you get I if
may be con-

433
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,940
I guess I says to the Commission but
don't you know I will too

434
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,390
install the Metasploit Framework the gym
law

435
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,750
just at the pretty much you and just run
it from there that'll this works out a

436
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,400
box as well

437
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,200
and they have everything you need to to
break up your guest system

438
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,390
so the nice one a says the Myst to

439
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:09,460
yes other ones like brute forcing the
the management console in things the

440
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,930
guest in this particular cool because it
means you've got guest access

441
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,420
on a on a local system I want every bit
for mercy missiles on a host

442
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,470
iPhone p.m. guess Taylor and get down at
a coffee

443
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:23,400
so I have all those meetings are get
security stuff it's just

444
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,290
that for you to death I'm just using a
party dress looks like I mean

445
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:31,670
great somewhat IBM i think im Taric
address looks like I mean literally

446
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,710
the code is like an hour thoughts last
last last last last last last

447
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,390
thank you very much from guessed right
and it just thinking

448
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,620
Co I like the Cyprus this this approach
to security and I thank you and

449
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,010
so right unfortunately I i try to do
something on this exciting

450
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:52,160
5 and I have patched so for ASA so just
as a warning to attack other ESXi 5

451
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,470
has been great improvement security
perspective okay

452
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:00,110
but then you know if they didn't prove
anything it will be wait to read

453
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:04,400
arm this is some they do stuff
conference on Sun not such a sounds fun

454
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,380
but just so you know you know some just
come back as a haven't heard of this

455
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,380
because got some news coverage recently
I'm from I get

456
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,730
he basically was able to say okay to get
a VMware image file you can

457
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,470
you can pass the house really easily
because essentially everything

458
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,300
is like this k text

459
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:29,130
so you not got any kind of on site in
creeks enough the images you just say

460
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,530
well thank you very much

461
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,830
Korea memory image three standard tools
as with many ways volatility and there

462
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,600
you go that's pretty 46

463
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,740
so okay so I'm using VMware guest era I

464
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:44,030
out the box to steal gets Assyrians
should I run into could actually she's

465
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,280
surrender to commit a crime scene

466
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,460
well then I just of the house and thank
you very much all

467
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,600
of the custom machine right so I'm not
even having to worry bout time

468
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,090
constraints I can say that

469
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,830
surpasses the cloud nine your favorite
clout provide a crack passes

470
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:01,040
and go back take coffee and come back to
it later and as a network you know that

471
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,070
I have access to whatever machines you
have

472
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,430
on your virtual psych pressurize a Shin
segment aka

473
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:11,190
kinda Marin maybe miss of me but maybe
73

474
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:14,400
on we will so this is also one recent

475
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,980
and I'm a recent release absence of
further just came out

476
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,060
Rico because I try to do this said about

477
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,580
fifteen years ago in assembler for
viruses and failed

478
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,470
I tried to crave arses with
self-adaptive for Michael 60pc

479
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,800
and risk xxxxX I'm not think so

480
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,510
going xxx in the some client-side this
is Rico

481
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,180
so here we see this going to shuffle is
its adaptive it works I where the crime

482
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:39,730
occurred six

483
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,040
I computer or when this and the cool
thing about this is now looking for BM

484
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,700
as well

485
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,440
so because the VM in its is stored in
clear text you can essentially

486
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,440
right to a virus package whatever in
Seaford replacing the image file

487
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,540
and is and then when the person
mountainside image in a VM

488
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,260
its then coming with the virus already
instantiated

489
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,740
have courses Tech Inc textiles right i
mean you don't gonna have number text

490
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,420
months is

491
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,990
monitoring your be an x-files so pretty
colour

492
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:09,470
I mean I just read it so this because
some the MNT point maybe some people are

493
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,440
interested

494
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,960
on by the way the slides should be
available and on

495
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,120
or the slights rock references to work
there are

496
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,570
the corresponding weblinks okay so that
hunt around for this research on

497
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,930
it with a nice that you just got my
presentation click directly presented

498
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:24,510
with the paper

499
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,800
okay and this was really cool

500
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,720
this stuff is awesome %uh so this is a
VMDK stuff I wish I'd done

501
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,440
home this these guys from your NW I am

502
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,120
we're taking the idea further with the
NDK so you Commission scripter

503
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,230
files and there are companies out there
now who

504
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,800
allowed to upload your virtual machines
to the environments and utilize

505
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,040
back on services brilliant except for
the fact that because it's the

506
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,950
to text nature the configuration files
you can start thinking causing

507
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:58,380
am with the fussing you can start
exploring the you know the

508
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,970
unified filesystem got those virtual
machines hosted on:

509
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,390
this in turn means you essentially
manually update

510
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:08,500
a VM configuration file missing text

511
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,540
you can mount other discs from guest

512
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:16,420
I of the host on in virtualized cloud
environments

513
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:20,360
riches I mean bam on these carbons a
problem multi-tenant right so they've

514
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,030
got other customers data there

515
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,600
with other much worse things and you
just at three lines into that

516
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,130
realization configuration file

517
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:30,040
a perjury am and all that now have
access like systems

518
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,790
so I highly recommend you check out
there that a presentation slides

519
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,840
its the recent stuff and it works for a
sec sci-fi

520
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,440
and this is all from guessed right so no
additional access levels

521
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,930
a toll needed so thank you very much

522
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,290
really record stuff so

523
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,730
appraisal cloud is upon us thank you
greats

524
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,330
for me people are going for it because
business on casper money

525
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,970
and its T so but im got security right

526
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,740
I am the back door forget it because
information

527
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,790
isn't secure axle and there's a chance
that

528
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,950
it's not going to be secure in any
future and also

529
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:15,490
nomic know about it SAR they don't know
how to write and summer program that the

530
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,210
and then

531
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:19,590
set this up as an instruction set to get
or required outputs

532
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,930
I mean a lot of pretty good VM engineers
also on aware of how this the m2

533
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,830
Communications reworking

534
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:30,010
okay so this is a really nice asset
inflation concerns

535
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:34,840
channel which I recommend your some just
have a look at and play with

536
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,430
environments and become aware that if
you're if your client's

537
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:41,470
and say you know not seem to work out a
locking down you can look at something

538
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,330
as I said

539
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:46,640
what you can do kinda cage overlooking
some things that

540
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,510
on this stuff is new this indicator
expectations stuff and it's really quite

541
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,530
dangerous

542
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:55,570
so I don't know how these are
hydrocarbons

543
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:58,820
really console fax and was on this
VMware's

544
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,210
giving for texts I the NDK files

545
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:05,520
and an on-site eyes and puts you know
that's gonna

546
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,740
ask about free just gonna last a long
time

547
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,100
um have uncovered a trillion much detail
here but the recessed of

548
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,760
circles of wonderful this is also been
demonstrated the V's for stuff is really

549
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,200
nice thing which if you can exploit
terminal tackle the SOAP calls

550
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,510
through HTTPS requests you have access
the entire infrastructure in one mice

551
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,640
console

552
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,680
server the idea I just on a client's
from

553
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,150
my PC I get the IP address I dialed up
that's

554
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:34,000
I I'm nice to you I skipped of its own
and we'll take whatever

555
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,430
and I have full access to all
infrastructure thank you very much have

556
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,140
been home

557
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,930
yes thank you I can do whatever I want
to levy and gravy and store your entire

558
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,720
infrastructure in a few clicks

559
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,760
fantastic great hack so this is also
brilliant

560
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,500
again this is one advance to the
virtualization was right after a

561
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,180
physical server

562
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,090
oh my god tonight well to destroy the
physics ever might have to bring two

563
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:53,740
bases and

564
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,220
well we all know that people fans come
or other data centers myself west of

565
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,990
rights and trying to the data center

566
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,030
I mean green one thing here that's
pretty hard riding cock

567
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:06,060
fingerprints you cooked on securing gone
is on social intercourse but

568
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:09,360
sometimes works but most the time a free
tough stuff

569
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,660
whereas now it's like a system status of
course there is a flat file

570
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:18,180
morning cryptids configuration which is
holding we'll call data

571
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:22,130
okay some the world is so much nicer I'm

572
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,530
you know the national and Oregon things
yet so

573
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:30,300
and the fam a backdoor is always
available moment and be much network

574
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,340
cuz that's the a memory that transmits
the image also include a tax

575
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:38,300
so BM where come back and say okay we're
in every

576
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,810
acknowledge that this could be
problematic but your network I should be

577
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:44,600
designed so that the motion stuff goes
on a secure network

578
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,570
outs have found some the other network

579
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:52,040
but to really is doing this leaving us
in nobody

580
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,630
do this except maybe some VMware and
that source VM engineers directly from

581
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,990
p.m.

582
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,130
which means that the mushy stuff they
just click click click

583
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:04,880
all rights working core but they can
also make this so you can say okay so

584
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,070
I got a VM running in this cluster and
it's the threshold

585
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:11,730
succeeded miss the Emerald might
transmit another cluster

586
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:15,490
that transmissions happened to tax well
intersects the network

587
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:18,710
so I sister network I said okay this is
a start I guess the entire thank you

588
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,080
very much reconstruct I have %um

589
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,200
perfect I mean I guess I'm all inc.'s
stock no privileged access

590
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,840
so I was going to text it's it's it's
just beautiful so

591
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,330
yeah so I I should try me a bit
optimistic

592
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:36,860
so I suppose I don't know why but I
suppose I said just be balanced right

593
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:40,330
so VMware are doing so I'm patching I
don't know

594
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,820
this kid was as good thing could be said
about the i mean they are getting their

595
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,870
stuff together the

596
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:47,710
as at the 5 release is much better than
three I am

597
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:51,150
and okay said adding some stuff great

598
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:54,230
I am people the the commonest

599
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:57,270
should be so hatching the system thing
keeping up with a

600
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,470
we know this doesn't happen so that was
kinda attempt to be optimistic

601
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:03,790
if they did what they said is you do it
should be a good thing the Securities

602
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,730
going folks saying

603
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,080
focus on p.m. well for the same so the
functionality is

604
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,280
assign the hardware well as we can do
VMware profiling which means going

605
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,660
golden images which is for the skipper
Dennis and securing the arrests

606
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,590
of course it's not securing the
hypervisor Excel

607
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:22,090
so that's what I focus you know the
hypervisor is on where right and you can

608
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,450
compromise the hypervisor

609
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,160
forget about all your other security
okay

610
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,110
I'm and mr. update this is a neat little
utility from VMware which says okay

611
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:34,060
we'll help you out they were your
platform with this Automatic Update

612
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,660
thing

613
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,050
much for months when there's something
an interesting point about that

614
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:41,120
in the second pessimism sir

615
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,820
greats much more interesting I am okay
so going back to the VM backdoor

616
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:49,270
really important video icon stress
enough that it's not look down

617
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:53,280
you re sick and focus with work how to
exploit that arm

618
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,320
this said resources stuff you never got
that up for the segregation we can

619
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:57,950
really

620
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:01,530
say okay we physically separated boxes
in a virtualized landscape between

621
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,140
genetic mixing them security

622
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,850
in my in okay I a segregation

623
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:10,329
a set that the scores more about the
same thing arm

624
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:14,599
so it's been a catastrophe when you when
when when fans going that direction of

625
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,450
securing about level

626
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:19,899
I'm you can never remove the boxes agree
it's just all this matter datacom

627
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:24,679
flying around on this guy's XO to his
pretty cool I recently released three

628
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:29,289
ICE's on the happenings in the
recognized yet type in contact with him

629
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:33,399
and I may have a look at this simply
because we see in March

630
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:36,539
he's on the wrong way over right
privilege escalation vulnerability

631
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:40,089
morning in May his eyes and purrs code
execution for the death machine

632
00:34:40,089 --> 00:34:43,619
and then what's going on man this life
member country and breakouts so

633
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:47,639
3 access EVA's which have not been
patched that arrogance in essence

634
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,899
mayor much for this year you're free to
look at them use them

635
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:54,250
my text

636
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:57,259
that cycling brilliant okay so

637
00:34:57,259 --> 00:35:01,569
missus just right of them worse and the
site rights does the M where have I said

638
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:02,700
your patch cycle

639
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,029
when restructure cycles carmella there
is no perhaps recycle

640
00:35:07,029 --> 00:35:10,680
as Microsoft top three sovereign systems
and VMware you can check

641
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,500
continuously an update manager okay
fantastic so we've got our

642
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,160
you gotta you have a guy rechecking this
and then going

643
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,109
agree impact as we know with the win is
catching world this doesn't necessarily

644
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:24,210
happen

645
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:27,789
and it's also ok if I take my 53 my ESXi
offline

646
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:31,539
thank my infrastructure comes off like
some reason so the risk factor there's

647
00:35:31,539 --> 00:35:32,170
like

648
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:36,200
unit alarm is going have we don't do
that okay so this is kind of thing just

649
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,289
stuff

650
00:35:37,289 --> 00:35:41,319
and just give you not there a up to
August this year this is the kind of

651
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:43,630
numbers cutie visor should a month by
VMware

652
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:47,109
so if you've got one guy trying to
monitor these democrats things

653
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:50,559
you can have a full time guy doing it
and with the

654
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:53,789
with added problem that you know thats

655
00:35:53,789 --> 00:35:57,450
might say yes exile like tensely I can
see this

656
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:00,779
this and working for the future

657
00:36:00,779 --> 00:36:05,079
I just one mentioned this is a sativa
the plug slide really

658
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,430
if your interest in this stuff and how
to do it correctly I really recommend to

659
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,710
take up his ball outs

660
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,299
and everything's laps I were trying to
stir in there

661
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:16,519
with curious how the process

662
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:20,339
arm she's really looking segmented
security

663
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:24,430
from from not dismiss on Boxing level
but from really I machine advertiser

664
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:28,450
virtualization level so she sees
generally work in San

665
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:31,950
on which I know without its problems but
she's

666
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:35,230
have her nineteen a pretty pretty hot
cracks on the stuff

667
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,730
and they they call their account
together you can balance now it's just

668
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:38,670
come fear

669
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:44,079
crashed on its release stop playing with
that as hackers in Kittery recommend I K

670
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,470
the problem is okay so the love of but
promise she says okay she says IRS

671
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,099
wedding some boxes kinda cool

672
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:53,119
but you have five guys have massive
problems and I'm sure thank you baby I

673
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:53,829
rest my

674
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:58,910
how for each other stuff I am and sister
was he saying with her stuff is the

675
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,539
honestly this actually use
responsibility for making security

676
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:03,029
decisions

677
00:37:03,029 --> 00:37:05,720
so who was gonna management tell them
that right that's never going to happen

678
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,990
but at least us

679
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,539
if we're if re got security concerns we
should embolden I

680
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:14,569
its gonna work on Linux solar hey fun
for us

681
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:18,380
and this its reaction to stop playing
with a high segregate your data into

682
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,410
security segment on your machine

683
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:25,160
so I highly recommend get involved not
if you're concerned about virtualization

684
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,869
so I just wanna quickly now collect em
is that so it's when a quickie

685
00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:31,980
talk about what I'm kinda the rink I am

686
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,119
I'm but then I saw they were here simply
because the

687
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,859
uneven structure behind and I tried
running it sucks on my laptop

688
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:43,670
with XI virtualized and workstations so
dual layer virtualisation and blah blah

689
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:47,509
just income of so then I thought well a
kid I have a good connection from here

690
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:48,059
to the

691
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:51,599
my home to do that not the world even
the people who heads maybe not a good

692
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,660
idea

693
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:56,450
so this yeah I'm for you think about
that

694
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:00,339
that the producing what I'm working on
directly on

695
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:03,619
but what I'm would like to propose and
if anyone has any synthesis I'm

696
00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:06,920
please please come to me about this is a
company for my way what I mean by this

697
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,789
is

698
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:11,720
its kinda arsenic in and makes the
United defines the Houston states with

699
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,589
the highest

700
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:16,579
so we have never shies environment is
data in transit so you have to do with

701
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:17,650
this the motion

702
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:21,549
transition between cost is I mean I even
had a company secondly this

703
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,900
have systems going to put in a
development segment two developments

704
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,069
environment on on on virtualization
platform

705
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:31,619
one size approved and I think that's
okay and static not found in my grade up

706
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:33,849
the quality and production

707
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:37,539
so this means if I can infiltrate the
system developments that they will get

708
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:39,670
transmitted to the productive network

709
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,819
with my Mauer because the idea of them I
was passing my ways

710
00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:46,950
in fact host and stays them with the
hopes the idea is not to then

711
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,400
go out it's it's kinda like the old days
and times there s and stuff

712
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,599
its kind in that gonna that kind of way

713
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,609
um as I said this is a kind of concepts
the moment on and still so who works at

714
00:38:57,609 --> 00:39:00,559
a work in progress it's a momentous
consistent with the scripts

715
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:03,700
I have to do some about what's going on
actual application

716
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,240
arm animal so we're looking to integrate
the blue pill

717
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,809
kinda stuff so you got a rootkit

718
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:14,339
so folks not successfully the actual
applications hidden from the whole

719
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:15,000
system so

720
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,839
never detective so I suck on some

721
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:21,859
gonna move operation in this against us
affects me

722
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:26,940
guys snow sleep arm may be set up and I
was heavy drinking last night

723
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,890
so hide it would be the so identified
him I'm an expert system across

724
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:34,690
and given I than fun environment perform
a second reconnaissance

725
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:38,240
so this kinda rootkits arsenic my with
some system

726
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,059
start liking them a back door it was
thought sniffing network passively

727
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:45,839
looking for any tax concerning other the
motions things if it finds it put it out

728
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,369
send it back to his house and come back
Mon control center const I'll

729
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:53,029
arm I'm not talking about this is a perk
on Sat right so haven't discussed how

730
00:39:53,029 --> 00:39:56,589
you to hide the sky network traffic from
VM and break so it still in the early

731
00:39:56,589 --> 00:39:58,430
stages right

732
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:02,309
on the test entrance trigger migration
in concert asking for integration was it

733
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:04,430
was an additional much less considering

734
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:08,759
and this sorry if I so about so it's a

735
00:40:08,759 --> 00:40:12,480
this means the try to mimic that the
motion stuff so the motion stuff allows

736
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,119
you to

737
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,930
ActionScript and say that of like to say
when I see you on this costly said San

738
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:21,470
triggers missing to move ahead so its
automated a

739
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:25,499
message resource allocation was really
cool because if people have what I did

740
00:40:25,499 --> 00:40:26,130
that for me

741
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:30,490
than that means my parasitic nowhere
that migrate to another cluster

742
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:34,220
I can see if another much missus am I
gonna cluster and arm

743
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,519
maybe they can anchor a network and so
all I need to do

744
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:41,789
is if the CPU a lot to do rights are you
re on how he's got it right this time

745
00:40:41,789 --> 00:40:42,980
some stuff to

746
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,499
that now I'll come on deming around a
number something not watch the CPU

747
00:40:46,499 --> 00:40:47,849
estimation go straight up

748
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:51,420
it happens at night knowing monitoring
this p.m. transitions everyone saying

749
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,460
well fine and dandy

750
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,369
my my ways rootkits and only knows it's
there maybe they're not reported about

751
00:40:56,369 --> 00:40:58,519
really did mean to look to see what is
happening

752
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:03,259
medically fantastic I'm a new cluster I
have a whole lot and stuff like unpaid

753
00:41:03,259 --> 00:41:07,069
fantastic so this is what I'm trying to
build at the moment and get out there

754
00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:08,319
and

755
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,720
and if you haven't so this month I think
it's a crazy idea where they think

756
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,210
whatever police I'm really open to this
is the first time its kinda the

757
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:18,930
presented so to people other than myself

758
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:22,490
it could be a crazy idea right i mean it
has to convince John just not swell how

759
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:23,640
this is never going to work

760
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,430
on please I'm American to that so this
is my environment

761
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:30,619
what I have a home as amusing as a
testbed

762
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:34,509
just some backgrounds I am my objectives

763
00:41:34,509 --> 00:41:37,769
so on them straight up attention threat
the my be

764
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:41,700
coming up and as I said I'm not familiar
with so many hypervisor packets of

765
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,249
so the work usually revolves around

766
00:41:45,249 --> 00:41:48,339
just taking some existing exploit to
whatever they

767
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:52,339
some COO just crack is found in the
summer and gone okay let's recognize I

768
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:53,119
see if we can

769
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,249
but in space haven't style refocusing on
virtualization platform

770
00:41:57,249 --> 00:42:01,529
as a whole to manipulate so that's what
I'm trying to say with Casey

771
00:42:01,529 --> 00:42:05,240
on other said month the main objectives
from this is

772
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,240
singer hunters inc: SOS to trigger the
motion stuff

773
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,240
Tom so just going to

774
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,490
the same from work has been together
what we could under its

775
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,759
its that's a a nice to get some place
and I'm just a minute she sees a he

776
00:42:17,759 --> 00:42:19,759
doesn't care about getting your
information

777
00:42:19,759 --> 00:42:23,749
I for bringing network infrastructure
down 1i just call it the US attack

778
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:27,609
no had me mother well if I can't read
your the motion

779
00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:30,799
to move my the M in two different custer

780
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:33,999
I can continue to do that and to the
point where your VM

781
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:37,749
your ESXi server will just overload and
you can't do anything because you got VM

782
00:42:37,749 --> 00:42:42,359
constantly motion going to content from
so if I haven't put 'em ok systems

783
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:45,579
your esx/esxi infrastructure as a
problem

784
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:49,019
and when I have a problem yes the
restart rhyme with three stunning

785
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:52,200
then it means yeah the whole circus down
depending on where you go

786
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,779
i sat there so i think thats kinda cool
I am

787
00:42:55,779 --> 00:42:59,309
there's also apparently at the the be
overlooked

788
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:03,289
a limits which I'm not sure about him
tested for the source I want to explore

789
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,450
the PRC as well

790
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:08,319
this is gone once a one thousand files
you can just course thanks thanks

791
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:12,480
thank screen of death which as it is in
VMware on but that's just be tested us

792
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:12,869
again

793
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:16,289
wanna be effective supply OKC I

794
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:19,730
also explore cousin house in the sliced
infrastructure so this was to be

795
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:23,710
networks I think see what else is going
on pasta is nothing on the network

796
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:27,970
recycle stuff and the house it's like
100 100

797
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:32,069
with form reconnaissance analysis so is
a work in progress

798
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:36,390
a more to space I am providing people
then come back to me and

799
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:39,940
play me and say man stupid idea in the
neck of this conference and perhaps the

800
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,950
next couple months

801
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:44,249
a year and white paper on it so that
everyone can come if

802
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:48,180
understand a bit more and hopefully have
some more access to demo somethings

803
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:51,700
that'll make publicly available I'm

804
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,349
I'm kinda found it was for you amazing
engineer

805
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:59,079
you know not Apple a yes I have

806
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:02,779
I am I just like this the status in our
history when I think I McLouth

807
00:44:02,779 --> 00:44:05,930
I think it's gonna run this I think
there are going to be a lot harder

808
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:06,799
problems

809
00:44:06,799 --> 00:44:11,569
and I say guys hawkers let's make it so

810
00:44:11,569 --> 00:44:15,079
so hurts I to hack is out there

811
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:18,269
as I said this reverse psychology
mechanism I think revival we want it

812
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:19,140
means the cloud

813
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,279
it's a really interesting fun to play
with to explore

814
00:44:22,279 --> 00:44:26,140
break yeah go out there and and have fun

815
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:29,359
it turns the system stuff not the web
stuff and I think I'm wet now

816
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,910
it's it's kind of like me is really
great because I go back to come where my

817
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:33,480
roots were

818
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,789
and then after come where the SQL
injections in my stuff and more time

819
00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:39,900
is cool but it's not really my main
focus

820
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,710
on young ice yeah that's to be in the
clouds and that's great because other

821
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:44,549
